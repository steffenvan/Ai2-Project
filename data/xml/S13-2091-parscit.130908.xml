<bodyText confidence="0.999338823529412">
This paper describes the system developed by
the Serendio team for the SemEval-2013 Task
2 competition (Task A). We use a lexicon
based approach for discovering sentiments.
Our lexicon is built from the Serendio tax-
onomy. The Serendio taxonomy consists of
positive, negative, negation, stop words and
phrases. A typical tweet contains word varia-
tions, emoticons, hashtags etc. We use prepro-
cessing steps such as stemming, emoticon de-
tection and normalization, exaggerated word
shortening and hashtag detection. After the
preprocessing, the lexicon-based system clas-
sifies the tweets as positive or negative based
on the contextual sentiment orientation of the
words. Our system yields an F-score of 0.8004
on the test dataset.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.942091428571429">
Social media websites like Twitter, Facebook etc.
are a major hub for users to express their opinions
online. On these social media sites, users post com-
ments and opinions on various topics. Hence these
sites become rich sources of information to mine for
opinions and analyze user behavior and provide in-
sights for:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999854">
• User behavior
• Product feedback
• User intentions
• Lead generation
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998041">
Businesses spend an enormous amount of time
and money to understand their customer opinions
about their products and services. Thus Sentiment
Analysis has become a hot research area since 2002.
Sentiment Analysis is used to determine sentiments,
emotions and attitudes of the user. The text used for
analysis can range from big document (e.g. Product
reviews from Amazon, blogs) to small status mes-
sage (e.g. Tweets, Facebook comments). In this pa-
per, we confine to Twitter data i.e classify a tweet to
have a positive, negative or neutral sentiment.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we study relevant previous work on Sen-
timent Analysis on Twitter data. In Section 3, we
describe each processing step of our approach in de-
tail. In Section 4, we experiment with the training
and the lexicon. In Section 5, we report and evaluate
the final result obtained from the test data published
by the SemEval team. In Section 6, we present our
conclusions and outline our future work.

Sentiment Analysis on raw text is a well known
problem. The Liu (2012) book covers the entire
field of Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment Analysis can
be done using Machine learning or a Lexicon-based
approach. We use our lexicon based approach in our
study. The rest of the paper is confined to Lexicon
based approach

Evaluation (SemEval 2013), pages 543–548, Atlanta, Georgia, June 14-15, 2013. c�2013 Association for Computational Linguistics
sum of the sentiment orientation of each word or
phrase. Turney (2002) identifies sentiments based
on the semantic orientation of reviews. (Taboada et
al., 2011; Melville et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2008)
use lexicon based approach to extract sentiments.
Sentiment Analysis on microblogs is more chal-
lenging compared to longer discourses like reviews.
Major challenges for microblog sentiment analysis
are short length status message, informal words,
word shortening, spelling variation and emoticons.
Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data have been re-
searched by (Bifet and Frank, 2010; Berming-
ham and Smeaton, 2010; Pak and Paroubek, 2010).
We use our lexicon based approach to extract sen-
timents. The open lexicon such as Sentiword-
net (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Baccianella et
al., 2010), Q-wordnet (Agerri and Garcia-Serrano,
2010), WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti,
2004) are developed for supporting Sentiment Anal-
ysis. Studies have been made on preprocessing
tweets. Han and Baldwin (2011) used a classi-
fier to detect word variation and match the related
word. Kaufmann and Kalita (2010) gives the full
preprocessing approach to convert a tweet to normal
text. Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data is not con-
fined to raw text. Analyzing Emoticons have been
an interesting study. Go et al. (2009) used emoti-
cons to classify the tweets as positive or negative
and train standard classifiers such as Naive Bayes,
Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machines.
Hashtag may have some sentiment in it. Davidov
et al. (2010) used 50 hashtags and 15 emoticons as
sentiment labels for classification to allow diverse
sentiment types for the tweet. Negation and inten-
sifier play an important role in Sentiment Analysis.
Negation word can reverse the polarity, where as in-
tensifier increases sentiment strength. Taboada et
al. (2011) studied role of the intensifier and negation
in the lexicon based Sentiment Analysis. Wiegand
et al. (2010) survey the role of negation in Sentiment
Analysis.

3 Serendio Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999840636363636">
Serendio sentiment engine extracts and analyzes
sentiments for a given product and feature set.
Serendio sentiment engine currently works for eight
different domains such as banking, tablets, smart-
phones, televisions, apparel, gaming, automobiles
and e-readers. In this section, we will introduce
Serendio’s Sentiment engine and the enhancements
that were made to handle the SemEval Task 2, Task
A - Contextual Polarity Disambiguation (Wilson et
al., 2013). The main steps of our approach are ex-
plained in detail in the subsections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999971">
3.1 Creation of lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.8575078">
The lexicon can be created either manually
(Taboada et al., 2011; Tong et al., 2001) or expand-
ing automatically from a seed of words (Kanayama
et al., 2006; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007; Turney,
2002; Turney and Littman, 2003). In our study, the
lexicon is manually created. It is a one time process.
Two types of lexicons are created.
Common lexicon: This contains data that would
have the same semantic meaning or sense across dif-
ferent domains and categories.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999764578947369">
• Common or default sentiment words. Posi-
tive and Negative sentiment words that have the
same sentiment value or sense across different
domains. For e.g. sentiment word “good” al-
ways represents a positive sentiment and it is
independent of any category. Positive or Nega-
tive sentiment words have a sentiment score of
+1 or -1 to indicate the respective polarity.
• Negation Words. Negation words are the
words which reverse the polarity of sentiment.
For example, “The battery life is not good” has
negative sentiment
• Blind Negation Words. In the sentence, “The
T.V needs a better remote”, “needs” is a blind
negation word. Blind negation words operate
at a sentence level and points out the absence
or presence of some sense that is not desired in
a product feature.
• Split words. Split words are the words used
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.554694333333333">
for splitting sentences into clauses. The split
words list consists of conjunctions and punc-
tuation marks. For example the complex sen-
tence, “Camera is good but the battery is bad”
is split into two clauses “Camera is good” and
“Battery is bad”.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990596">
544
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959142857143">
Category specific lexicon: Category specific lex-
icon contains the (1) Product Catalog which iden-
tifies all the products that we are interested in. (2)
Feature Catalog which is a list of attributes that the
product has. This enables the Serendio engine to do
analysis at the feature level. (3) Sentiment words
(positive and negative) that are specific to the cate-
gory. For example, for a category such as Televi-
sions, a product would be Samsung TV. The feature
would be LCD screen and the word “glare” would
be the category specific negative sentiment word.
The semeval task 2 contains Twitter data that can-
not be pinned to any specific category. So for this
task, only the common lexicon was used.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998908">
3.2 Preprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9978008">
A typical tweet contains word variations, emoticons,
hashtags etc. The objective of the preprocessing step
is to normalize the text into an appropriate form to
extract the sentiments. Below are the preprocessing
steps used.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99986525">
• POS Tagging. POS Tagger gives part of
speech tag associated with words. POS tagging
is done using NLTK (Bird, 2006).
• Stemming. Stemmer gives the stem word.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.649744">
Serendio lexicon contains stem words only. So
non stem words are stemmed and replaced with
stem words. For example, words like ‘loved‘,
‘loves‘, ‘loving‘, ‘love‘ are replaced with ‘lov‘.
This would aid the engine to do the word match
from the text to the lexicon. Stemming is done
using NLTK
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.892788176470588">
• Exaggerated word shortening. Words which
have same letter more than two times and not
present in the lexicon are reduced to the word
with the repeating letter occurring just once
(Kouloumpis et al., 2011). For example, the
exaggerated word “NOOOOOO” is reduced to
“NO”.
• Emoticon detection. Emoticon has some sen-
timent associated with it. Twitter NLP (Ritter
et. al , 2011; Ritter et. al , 2012) is used to
extract emoticons along with the sentiments in
the Twitter data.
• Hashtag detection. The hashtag is a topic or
a keyword that is marked with a tweet. Hash-
tag is a phrase starting with # with no space
between them. Hashtags are identified and sen-
timents are extracted from them.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996888">
3.3 Sentiment calculation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971148148148">
Sentiment calculation is the aggregation of the sum
of the sentiment bearing entities of the tweet. Enti-
ties can be text, emoticons and hashtags. The sen-
timent calculation algorithm is shown in Algorithm
1. The sentiment calculation is based on a set of
heuristics built on the sentiment orientation of the
words. Blind negation words are extracted from the
sentence. The presence of the blind negation words
indicate negative sentiment. If the sentence contains
a blind negation word then other steps are skipped
and sentiment is blindly assigned as negative. Next,
sentiment words are extracted. The sentiment po-
larity of the word can be changed due to negation
words that occur in proximity (2 word distance).
If a sentiment word is not present, then the senti-
ment negation word becomes additive to the neg-
ative sentiment list. The sentence “I can not deal
it” has the negation word “not” and it does not con-
tain a sentiment word. So the negation word just
gets added to the negative sentiment word. Senti-
ments from emoticons are extracted with the help
of Twitter NLP. Sentiment words within the hash-
tag are extracted by python regex functions. For ex-
ample, from the hashtag “#ihateu”, the word “hate”
is extracted as a sentiment word. The sentiment of
the tweet is aggregated as the sum of the sentiments
from all the entities.

4 Experimental Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999516090909091">
The training data consist of real time tweets. 9451
subjective expressions are marked from all the
tweets and are labeled as positive or negative or neu-
tral. The average number of words of the marked
subjective expression is around 2 to 3 words. The
common dictionary that is constructed is shown in
Table 2. The Serendio sentiment engine is run on
the training data set. We identify the correct senti-
ment of the the phrases which are misclassified as
neutral, we include the phrases in our lexicon with
their appropriate sentiments.

Our sentiment engine performed reasonably well.
Please see Table 3 for Precision and Recall measure-
ments. The recall rates are lower because of our lexi-
cons lack of coverage of all the sentiment words. In-
formal language of tweets posed another challenge
for identifying negative sentiments. For example,
swear words such as “sh*t” and “f**k” are generally
considered as negative sentiment words. Phrases
such as “This sh*t is good” and “F**king awesome”
were identified as negative sentiments when in fact
they were expressing positive sentiments.

The Serendio lexicon that we used has sentiment
words with a sentiment attached to it. By integrat-
ing with a lexical source such as Sentiwordnet, we
feel we could get a more nuanced word sense dis-
ambiguation. For example, the word “good” is con-
sidered to have positive polarity. According to Sen-
tiwordnet 3.0, good as an adjective has 21 different
senses with different sentiments. For example, the
sentiment word “good” in the phrase “A good mile
from here” gives an objective sense, not in a positive
sense.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999466176470588">
In this paper we presented our system that we used
for the SemEval-2013 Task 2 for doing Sentiment
Analysis for Twitter data. We got an F-score of
0.8004 on the test data set.
We presented a lexicon based method for Senti-
ment Analysis with Twitter data. We provided prac-
tical approaches to identifying and extracting sen-
timents from emoticons and hashtags. We also pro-
vided a method to convert non-grammatical words to
grammatical words and normalize non-root to root
words to extract sentiments.
A lexicon based approach is a simple, viable and
practical approach to Sentiment Analysis of Twitter
data without a need for training. A Lexicon based
approach is as good as the lexicon it uses. To achieve
better results, word sense disambiguation should be
combined with the existing lexicon approach.

The feature would be LCD screen and the word “glare” would be the category specific negative sentiment word. The semeval task 2 contains Twitter data that cannot be pinned to any specific category. So for this task, only the common lexicon was used. 3.2 Preprocessing A typical tweet contains word variations, emoticons, hashtags etc. The objective of the preprocessing step is to normalize the text into an appropriate form to extract the sentiments. Below are the preprocessing steps used. • POS Tagging. POS Tagger gives part of speech tag associated with words. POS tagging is done using NLTK (Bird, 2006). • Stemming. Stemmer gives the stem word. Serendio lexicon contains stem words only. So non stem words are stemmed and replaced with stem words. For example, words like ‘loved‘, ‘loves‘, ‘loving‘, ‘love‘ are replaced with ‘lov‘. This would aid the engine to do the word match from the text to the lexicon. Stemming is done using NLTK • Exaggerated word shortening. Words which have same letter more than two times and not present in the lexicon are reduced to the word with the repeating letter occurring just once (Kouloumpis et al., 2011). For example, the exaggerated word “NOOOOOO” is reduced to</context>

In this section, we will introduce Serendio’s Sentiment engine and the enhancements that were made to handle the SemEval Task 2, Task A - Contextual Polarity Disambiguation (Wilson et al., 2013). The main steps of our approach are explained in detail in the subsections. 3.1 Creation of lexicon The lexicon can be created either manually (Taboada et al., 2011; Tong et al., 2001) or expanding automatically from a seed of words (Kanayama et al., 2006; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007; Turney, 2002; Turney and Littman, 2003). In our study, the lexicon is manually created. It is a one time process. Two types of lexicons are created. Common lexicon: This contains data that would have the same semantic meaning or sense across different domains and categories. • Common or default sentiment words. Positive and Negative sentiment words that have the same sentiment value or sense across different domains. For e.g. sentiment word “good” always represents a positive sentiment and it is independent of any category. Positive or Negative sentiment words have a sentiment score of +1 or</context>

Major challenges for microblog sentiment analysis are short length status message, informal words, word shortening, spelling variation and emoticons. Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data have been researched by (Bifet and Frank, 2010; Bermingham and Smeaton, 2010; Pak and Paroubek, 2010). We use our lexicon based approach to extract sentiments. The open lexicon such as Sentiwordnet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Baccianella et al., 2010), Q-wordnet (Agerri and Garcia-Serrano, 2010), WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) are developed for supporting Sentiment Analysis. Studies have been made on preprocessing tweets. Han and Baldwin (2011) used a classifier to detect word variation and match the related word. Kaufmann and Kalita (2010) gives the full preprocessing approach to convert a tweet to normal text. Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data is not confined to raw text</context>

The main steps of our approach are explained in detail in the subsections. 3.1 Creation of lexicon The lexicon can be created either manually (Taboada et al., 2011; Tong et al., 2001) or expanding automatically from a seed of words (Kanayama et al., 2006; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007; Turney, 2002; Turney and Littman, 2003). In our study, the lexicon is manually created. It is a one time process. Two types of lexicons are created. Common lexicon: This contains data that would have the same semantic meaning or sense across different domains and categories. • Common or default sentiment words. Positive and Negative sentiment words that have the same sentiment value or sense across different domains. For e.g. sentiment word “good” always represents a positive sentiment and it is independent of any category. Positive or Negative sentiment words have a sentiment score of +1 or -1 to indicate the respective polarity. </context>
