This paper explicates how English and
Polish select different aspects of a spatial
situation to express coincidence or prox-
imity. Spatial relations verbalized by dif-
ferent senses of at in English are re-
flected primarily by means of w, na, przy
and u in Polish. First, at is presented as
conceptualizing the relation of coinci-
dence or proximity with the whole
Landmark (LM) when it is conceived as a
point. Then, the Polish prepositions are
investigated – how they differ with re-
spect to the specific part of the LM that is
involved in a topological relation. Al-
though the prepositions are available to
the speakers of the respective languages
to render different types of relations, their
senses overlap in a complex way.

Although speakers of English, Polish, Spanish,
Korean or any other language encounter the
same spatial relations and configurations, in real-
ity they may conceptualize them in different
ways because of the language they speak. As
Bowerman (1996, page 160) observes, space is
structured in different ways in different lan-
guages because “[l]anguages use surprisingly
different criteria to calculate similarities and dif-
ferences among spatial configurations, and this
means that their spatial categories cross-cut and
intersect each other in complex ways”. Thus, the
disparate division of space in particular lan-
guages arises from the divergent culture-
determined conceptualization of entities in the
description of spatial relations and the role as-
signed to the Trajector (TR) and LM in certain
contexts. In addition, cross-linguistic differences
emerge because the amount and kind of informa-
tion that spatial descriptions routinely convey,
and the situations that can be characterized read-
ily in spatial terms, differ from language to lan-
guage.
Taking into consideration the way spatial re-
lations are expressed by at in English, one may
claim that few languages possess an equivalent
of this preposition, with the rare exception of the
French preposition d, analyzed by Vandeloise
(1991, pages 157-185). Such a claim is expressed
in the title of Cuyckens’s (1984) paper: “At: A
typically English preposition”. Also, Cienki
(1989, page 128) defines at as a “particularly
English preposition”. Certainly, the semantic
distinctions made by English speakers that re-
quire the use of at are not made by Slavic lan-
guages, such as Russian, analyzed by Cienki
(1987, 1989) or Slovenian and Croatian, investi-
gated by Šaric (2001). Neither are they made in
Polish. As Cuyckens (1984, page 49) remarks,
there is no close correspondence between the
English at and its Polish translations, as there
would be for the English prepositions in and on,
expressed in Polish by w and na. The point-like
quality of the LM and the generality1 of the TR’s
coincident location with regard to the LM are
non-existent in Polish; the function that the LM
serves seems not to be expressed by any preposi-
tion in Polish, either.
If this is the case, one is tempted to investi-
gate how the point-like LM is reflected in Polish
and whether it has any regular exponents in the
system of spatial relations or whether it is re-
flected in a rather irregular manner. Undoubt-
1 Obviously, the concept of ‘generality’ is subjective
to a certain extent. Maciejewski (1996: 76f.), for ex-
ample, considers Polish, English, German and Rus-
sian as languages equally specific in defining spatial
relations, as compared to Turkish, which does not
communicate directly the external, (‘adessive’) or
internal (‘inessive’) relation at all.

edly, Polish speakers must specify the spatial
relation between the TR and the LM more ex-
plicitly from the start. The translations of at in
Polish include the prepositions w, na, przy and u.
Convergences and divergences between at and
its Polish equivalents follow the section present-
ing sense distinctions of at.
2 The cognitive approach to at
In order to avoid the ‘polysemy fallacy’,2 against
which Sandra and Rice (1995, page 89) warn,
Tyler and Evans’s (2003, pages 47-50) method-
ology has been followed to determine the pri-
mary sense and distinct senses of at. Their list of
criteria includes the occurrence of the earliest
attested meaning, predominance in the semantic
network, use in composite forms and relations to
other spatial prepositions. Several others, such as
domain basicness, depiction of at in the entries
of monolingual dictionaries, and frequency of the
use, have been added by the author.
What seems to matter in the identification of
distinct senses is an additional layer which is not
apparent in any other senses associated with any
particular form: a distinct sense must involve
either a non-spatial relation or a different con-
figuration between the TR and LM. Second, in-
stances of the new sense must be context-
independent, that is, the distinct sense cannot be
inferred from another sense and the context in
which it occurs (Tyler and Evans 2003, pages
42-45).
Having considered all the aforementioned c-
riteria, the primary sense is assumed to depict a
spatial relation between a TR and a point-like
LM regarded as a point of reference, as in (1)
(Figure 1):

2By the ‘polysemy fallacy’ Sandra (1998) means the falla-
cious assumption that a fine-grained account in the identifi-
cation of distinct senses will be accepted just because it is
logically possible. Yet, the fact that a linguist can come up
with an elaborate and plausible semantic network for a par-
ticular form does not indicate that this is how language us-
ers represent the meanings associated with such forms.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.989173">
the dimensionality, size and shape of the LM are
not important. Important, however, is the fact
that we can localize the TR with regard to the
LM.
Once the primary sense of AT has been estab-
lished, distinct senses can be identified. Although

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99681">
depicts inclusion in the LM’s confines or region,
and hence the same spatial relation as in (1), it
indicates some function that the LM performs.
LMs such as the dentist’s include information
about the reason why the TR is at that particular
place. In other words, the place that the TR visits
implies its special function and/or the person
who provides the service:

<bodyText confidence="0.999775">
In Figure 2 the LM’s function is depicted by
means of arrows directed at the TR; they are an
indication of the influence the LM has on the TR.
The LM takes a cubical, not a point-like, shape
in order to convey its interaction with the TR.

<figureCaption confidence="0.671373333333333">
Example (3) qualifies for the distinction of
another sense represented by the subschema in

<bodyText confidence="0.997439083333333">
In examples (1) and (2) we dealt with the TR
oriented somewhere inside the LM, and hence
with ‘internal proximity’. In (3) the TR is outside
the LM, and therefore the relation depicts ‘exter-
nal proximity’. Subschema 3 depicts the TR ori-
ented externally in the front region of the LM,
with some interaction taking place between the
TR and LM, indicated in Figure 3 by the arrows.
The TR, Mark, is situated in front of the com-
puter because he is probably using it. It is impor-
tant to notice that the TR is in the front region of
the LM.

When we consider examples in (4):

b. I have a small table at the side of my bed.
c. They met at the corner of West Street and
Park Street,

<bodyText confidence="0.999813769230769">
again they depict externally located TRs, Mary, a
small table or they, with regard to two- or one-
dimensional LMs, the gate, a small table or the
corner, but the LMs perform no function here. In
this case, the TR does not have to be oriented in
the LM’s front region. It suffices that it is in the
LM’s proximity. Neither the dimensions nor the
LM’s size or shape are important. The sub-
schema of this sense represents only the external
location of the TR in relation to the LM. The
smaller the LM, the more precise the TR’s posi-
tion becomes. The possible configurations of
Subschema 4 are depicted in Figure 4:

<bodyText confidence="0.982813666666666">
In Figure 4, the cuboid-shaped TR is located
close to the point-like LM taking the form of a
black dot in (a), one-dimensional LM repre-
sented by a line in (b), and the two-dimensional
LMs, oriented horizontally or vertically, in (c).
Another sense of static at involves the part-
whole relation. Thus, Subschema 5 depicts a re-
lation between the TR located with regard to a
part of the LM, as in:
(5) Soon we were at the edge of the woods.
Usually, in such cases the front-back or top-
bottom orientation is evoked. Because the LM as
a whole is too extensive or too imprecise to lo-
cate another entity, a part thereof is designated
for this purpose. In Figure 5, the designated part
of the LM, with respect to which the TR is lo-
cated, is highlighted in the elongated spherical
shape. The TR is represented by a cuboid shape.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.659798">

Yet another distinct sense evokes the concept
of scale. Consider example (6):

<figureCaption confidence="0.913939">
Figure 6. Subschema 6

<bodyText confidence="0.9639865">
Subschema 6 construes the TR in space with pre-
cise or approximate measurement of distance.
Thus, the LM is a point on the metric scale, as is
depicted in Figure 6.
The choice of the term dynamic for the last
subschema of at can be justified by the TR’s
movement towards the LM, as opposed to the
static sense of at. Consider:
(7) The tall man is aiming a dart at the bull’s
eye.
Also, it expresses the force dynamics aspect
which is involved in the relation (cf. Talmy
1988).

In Figure 7, the TR is distant from the LM,
but is moving in its direction along the trajectory
marked with a broken arrow. The diagram does
not indicate whether the TR reaches the LM; the
arrow is coincident with the circular LM: al-
though dynamic at does not indicate that the TR
accomplishes the goal, it does not exclude such a
possibility. The dynamic at relation construes a
complex atemporal relation, as it is not reduced
to a single consistent configuration, as was the
case with the static scene (Langacker 1987,
pages 220- 221).

tions are imposed on the container in the position
of the LM for such translation to be possible.
Firstly, the locations construed in English as one-
dimensional reference points are conceptualized
in Polish as containers with boundaries delimit-
ing the position of the TR on all sides. Entities
feasible in the position of the LM include all
types of buildings and institutions, such as ho-
tels, night clubs, etc. Consider the following
example:
(8) We spent a night at a motel.
‘Spedziligmy noc w motelu.’
A motel represents a LM which constitutes an
idealized cubical container. Sometimes, institu-
tions are represented metonymically by the
proper names of cities, in which they are located.
However, the whole community must associate
the city, with the institutions located in them. In
(9):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987298">
(9) He’re at Oxford.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.968612375">
‘On studiuje w Oksfordzie.’
the LM, Oxford, stands for, a university which is
well known to the British public. In Polish,
names of cities often collocate with w + LOC;
hence, the translation is ‘w Oksfordzie’. How-
ever, if the phrase was stripped of the metonymy,
w + LOC would no longer be possible although
at would still be used in English. The translation
of at in the non-metonymic sentence, He’s at
university in Oxford would be: ‘On studiuje na
uniwersytecie w Oksfordzie’, i.e. na + LOC.
Some instances of Subschema 1 conceptual-
ize the LM as a point rather than a multi-
dimensional entity, but in Polish such cases are
still depicted by means of w + LOC. By way of
example consider the following sentence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8113945">
(10) He had his leg amputated at the hip.
‘Amputowali mu nogg w biodrze.’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.969000125">
The LM, the hip, is conceptualized as the point
where the entity begins, its part used metonymi-
cally to represent the whole. In Polish, by con-
trast, it is still conceptualized as a three-
dimensional volume characterized by thickness
and boundaries.
Alternatively, a place can be conceptual-
ized as a point on the map in order to be trans-
lated with w + LOC, as in:
(11) her estates at Balmoral
‘jej posiadło§ci w Balmoral’
In (11) the Queen’s properties were being enu-
merated, and the concept of Great Britain as an
island on the map was bound to appear in the
speaker’s mind.
As Sysak-Boronska (1980, page 39) ob-
serves, “with ‘point-apprehensibility’ being to-
tally alien to the Polish system of locative con-
cepts, there is at least one such discipline for
which the notion of ‘point’ is fundamental and
unavoidable.” Geometry appears to be the only
discipline dealing with points, lines, planes and
intersections in Polish. Below is an example
quoted after Sysak-Boronska (1980, page 39):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.578464">
(12) Two circles cut at A and B.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986754923076923">
‘Dwa okretgi przecinaj4 sip w punktach A i B.’
Apparently, the TR’s location is that of an ideal-
ized point both in English and Polish. Yet, in
Polish the point is rendered as the LM which en-
closes or envelops the TR, a relation conveyed
by in. In English, on the other hand, the relation
is that of coincidence and hence at is used.
Apart from the LMs belonging to Subschema
1, conceived as mere reference points, one
should mention those which perform some func-
tion and constitute members of Subschema 2.
Their relation with regard to the TR is also ren-
dered by w + LOC in Polish:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9288815">
(13) He is still at school.
‘On jest jeszcze w szkole.’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99941035">
Like (8), example (13) depicts inclusion within
the confines or region of the LM. Again, the
point-like LM in English corresponds to the con-
ceptualization of a three-dimensional LM in Pol-
ish. In both languages, the sentence additionally
indicates some function that the LM performs.
The functionality of particular LMs is not
equally spread across cultures. Schools have
functional associations in both English and Pol-
ish. However, in Polish on many occasions it is
the context which specifies the LM’s function
rather than the LM itself. In English the sentence
Mark is at the office implies some work that
must be done by the TR in the location of the
LM. The Polish translation of the sentence,
‘Marek jest w biurze’, only indicates the TR’s
location but not the reason why the TR is there.
Only the context could fill in the information.
The use of w is also present in translations of
dynamic at. A certain class of verbs tends to ap-

pear in such contexts which denote movement by
the hand or a leg aiming at some point located on
somebody’s body or on an object. The movement
is rather violent and abrupt; hence, all types of
throwing actions are involved: to throw sth at
someone/something ‘rzucic czym§ w kogo§/co§’.
In all these cases a point-like target is presup-
posed for at. However, in Polish the LM is con-
strued as a container regardless of the limited
amount of contact between the TR and LM. Sy-
sak-Boronska (1980, page 42) remarks that it is
the verbs that presuppose a point-like target.

4 At vs. na + LOC
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999002476190476">
Na + LOC seems to constitute the closest Polish
equivalent of the sense of at which indicates
general internal location. This sense of at is rep-
resented by Subschema 1, where the LM, whose
dimensions, size and shape are ignored, and
which is conceptualized as a point, coincides
with the TR. The coincidence of the two entities
may involve the TR’s location within the LM’s
interior or its region. Important is the fact that we
can localize the TR with regard to the LM. Just
as at conceptualizes the LM as a point of refer-
ence for the TR, so na + LOC indicates the gen-
eral location of the TR with regard to the LM
(Sysak-Boronska 1980, page 70; Cienki 1989,
pages 110-111.; Dancygier 2000, page 30). This
sense of na does not necessarily imply contact
between the TR and LM, a characteristic feature
of the preposition, but rather forms some associa-
tion between the two entities. Thus, it is the most
appropriate equivalent of at in the following sen-
tence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9064185">
(15) He is waiting at the airport.
‘On czeka na lotnisku.’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995177909090909">
In the above sentence we do not know where
precisely the TR is located; what is known is
only its approximate location with regard to the
LM as the point of reference. This type of rela-
tion works for both at and na + LOC.
The tendency to indicate general location by
means of na + LOC, as Sysak-Boronska (1980,
page 70) notes, has grown since the 1960s in col-
loquial Polish, particularly with reference to the
place of work. In such occurrences reference to
buildings and institutions is made. Consider:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.763221">
(16) Mój tata pracuje na poczcie.
‘My father works at the post office.’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.982312">
If the functional aspect of such use of na + LOC
were present, as maintained by Awdiejew (1977,
page 107), the verb byc ‘to be’ instead of pra-
cowac ‘to work’, etc., should also bring some
associations with an activity undertaken in the
location. However, the sentence becomes rather
ambiguous then:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.863455">
(17) Mój tata jest na poczcie.
’My father is at the post office.’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.690234833333333">
Unless some context is provided, (17) will indi-
cate general location of the TR, mój tata ‘my
father’, in the region of the LM, poczta ‘the post
office’.
Understandably, not all occurrences of na +
LOC in such contexts are translatable with at:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.762516">
(18) Mój tata pracuje na kolei.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9817625">
‘My father works for/*at the railway company.’
Therefore, the use of na + LOC to indicate gen-
eral location translatable into at in English is re-
stricted. Clear rules of its occurrence are hard to
formulate, though.
Na + LOC is also appropriate as a translation
of at in a number of topographical and geo-
graphical locations. As for the first group, na +
LOC is used when the LMs are construed as de-
void of clear boundaries, e.g.:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.627995">
(19) Men are working at the construction site.
‘Mp,2czy2ni pracuj4 na placu budowy.’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.911176333333333">
In that case, LMs are usually two-dimensional
entities constituting a part of the city.
Finally, na + LOC constitutes a translation of
at in some part-whole relations. An extreme part
of the LM is the location of the TR:
(20) The house was at the end of the street.
‘Dom znajdował sip, na koncu ulicy.’
To a certain extent, na + LOC shares this func-
tion with u + GEN, e.g.:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.702017625">
(21) Soon we were at the edge of the woods.
‘Wkrótce byli§my na/u skraju lasu.’
Sometimes na + LOC functions as an
equivalent of at in the case of the external prox-
imity of Subschema 4, and then it often alter-
nates with przy + LOC. The TR bears a lateral
relation to the LM, but the position is not precise,
and it may be considered as coincident or rather
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.998348">
13
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.775176166666667">
contiguous with the LM, contiguity being usually
reflected by means of na + LOC in Polish.
Hence, the substitution of przy for na is possible:
(22) They met at the corner of West Street and
Park Street.
‘Spotkali sip, na/przy rogu ulic West Street
i Park Street.’
Similar to the English at of Subschema 6, na
+ LOC is also used with points of a scale. This
subschema includes cases where the distance of a
journey is involved. Consider:
(23) At 2,000 metres below sea level there are
fewer fish.
‘Na głebokogci 2000 m poni2ej poziomu mo-
rza jest mniej ryb.’
Again, this usage of na + LOC is limited, and
other prepositions, including pod (e.g. at an an-
gle ‘pod k4tem’), are applicable.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.782799" genericHeader="method">
5 At vs. przy + LOC
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.924421352941176">
Subschemas 3 and 4 of at represent external
proximity, a feature characteristic also of the Pol-
ish przy. Generally, the preposition conceptual-
izes a TR situated in proximity to a three-
dimensional LM, where direct contact is possi-
ble. The TR can be situated very close to the
front, back, or one of the sides of the LM. How-
ever, the sense of przy overlaps with that of at
only when the TR is related either to the LM’s
front or back. What is more, in the majority of
instances the function of the LM is implied, as in
(24a), or some connection when the two entities
are inanimate, as in (24b):
(24)a. Mark is sitting at the computer.
‘Marek siedzi przy komputerze.’
b. a chair at the table
krzesło przy stole’
In (24a), the examples involve a TR oriented in
very close proximity to the LM. As indicated by
Klebanowska (1969, page 185), the TR is ori-
ented towards the functional side of the LM, and
hence is capable of using it. The functionality of
the LM is present both in English and Polish. If
there is no function present, the relation is still
rendered by means of przy in Polish and by in
English. Consider:
(25) Martha is standing by the car.
‘Marta stoi przy samochodzie.’
A distinction must be made, however, for the
relation where the TR takes the lateral position
towards the LM, and when the LM is construed
as a linear entity. The TR and the LM must be
oriented towards each other vertically not hori-
zontally, and both at and by are applicable:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7591655">
(26) He parked the car at/by the kerb.
‘Zaparkował samochód przy krawezniku.’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.948919142857143">
According to Przybylska (2002, pages 496-
497), the LM can also be idealized as a point in
the przy-relation, which appears to be the most
characteristic feature of at. All geometrical fea-
tures of the LM are irrelevant – only the close-
ness of the TR to the LM, or their contact, is at
issue. Consider the following example:
(27) We met at the monument.
‘Spotkaligmy sip, przy pomniku.’
However, the extent to which the TR is used as a
one-dimensional point in English with the use of
at, and in Polish with przy, differs considerably,
one-dimensional LMs being much more common

6 At vs. u + LOC
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999599">
Occurrences of the preposition at which can be
rendered in Polish by means of u + GEN belong
predominantly to Subschemas 1 and 2. Some
additional but rare instances can be found in the
translations of Subschema 5 representing the
part-whole relation. The first subschema, an in-
stance of which is provided in (28), takes the
Saxon genitive in the position of the LM:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.954027">
(28) Let’s meet at Tom’s.
‘Spotkajmy sip, u Tomka.’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995363727272727">
English at and Polish u + GEN in this type of
occurrence may indicate either the owner of the
place or its user. The name of a person collocat-
ing with the English preposition, or its Polish
equivalent, metonymically stands for the place
they own or live in.
Subschema 2 also takes the Saxon genitive.
Here, the person metonymically stands for the
place where they provide some service related to
their occupation. The function of the place is
usually implied, as in instances (29):
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995385">

<listItem confidence="0.8616125">
(29) Marie is at the butcher’s.
‘Maria jest u rzeznika.’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.953675782608696">
Sentence (29) indicates the reason why the TR,
Marie, is at the butcher’s; namely, she wants to
buy some meat. It is worth mentioning that the
person indicated in the Saxon genitive does not
have to be the one who provides the service. In-
stead of the butcher, it can be his assistant who
sells meat.
Understandably, some regular uses of u +
GEN turn out to be untranslatable by at in Eng-
lish. As Topolinska (1984, pages 282-284) notes,
there are a number of instances where u + GEN
collocates with the name of a person, which im-
plies the service that person provides but not the
location. Consider (30):
(30) Uczg sig angielskiego u profesor Kowal-
skiej.
‘I study English with professor Kowalska.’
*‘I am taught English at professor Kowalska’s.’
In the above example profesor Kowalska is the
person who provides the service. Nevertheless,
no implication of the LM of the service is made.
Thus, the sentence can be interpreted as ‘Profes-
sor Kowalska teaches me English’ rather than
‘Professor Kowalska’s place is where I am
taught English’. The service provider does not
even have to be a professional for u + GEN to be
applicable in Polish, as in:
(31) Czeszg sig u pani Smith.
‘I have my hair done by Mrs Smith.’
*‘I have my hair done at Mrs Smith’s’.
Thus, it is not the location but the agent which is
indicated in the u-construction in the two exam-
ples. It is rendered perfectly in English by the
preposition by whose primary function is to in-
troduce the agent. Of course, it is the verb that
reveals the type of service that is provided in a
particular location.
Another less frequent occurrence of u + GEN
refers to the extreme part of the LM. In the ma-
jority of cases the part-whole relation of the LM
is involved, where the contact between the TR
and LM is apprehended as involving merely a
point. Thus, the most prominent part of the LM
is the location of the TR. Contact between the
TR and LM is a possible but not a necessary
element of the configuration. Consider:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.749578">
(32) She came with two little dogs at her heels.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98075652173913">
‘Przyszła z dwoma małymi pieskami u no-
gi.’,
where the TR, two little dogs, is rather unlikely
to touch the LM, her heels. Regardless of the
degree of contact in the real world, it is assumed
that little contact is involved.
U + GEN is not the only translation of this
relation; na + LOC is also a frequent rendition of
the part-whole at-relation in English. However, a
number of instances of u + GEN, such as u sufitu
‘at the ceiling’, constitute stylistically marked
individual instances of this occurrence which is
also possible with przy + LOC: przy suficie ‘by
the ceiling’.
U + GEN is also applicable when the TR
constitutes a part of the LM, but the contact be-
tween them is limited to an idealized point:
(33) klamka u drzwi
‘a handle on the door’
*‘a handle at the door’
As indicated in the translation of the examples in
(33), the part-whole relation cannot be rendered
by means of at in English.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941153846154">
The degree of similarity displayed by the re-
spective pairs of equivalents has been investi-
gated in the paper, as well as the points which
are a source of divergences between the two spa-
tial systems. It has been observed that the closest
equivalent of at disregarding the dimensional
properties displayed by the LM is na + LOC.
Sysak-Boronska (1980, pages 730-731), who has
observed this regularity, does not hesitate to
stress, however, that the preposition does not
have an equal status with at in English. The re-
striction arises from the fact that this use of na is
not well-established in all contexts, nor is it
equally well received in all varieties of Polish.
Thus, it must be noted that at from Subschema 1
and the colloquial na + LOC play a similar role
in the respective spatial systems only to a limited
extent.
As for the conclusions ensuing from the
comparison of external relations, although at
constitutes the first translation of przy in bilin-
gual Polish-English dictionaries (e.g., NKFDPE),
the Polish preposition has also such English
equivalents as by, near, beside or next to, imply-
ing a position on the side of a three- or two-
dimensional LM.

<bodyText confidence="0.99986575">
To sum up, the two languages fail to coin-
cide in the application of the concept of the
proximous location, interior or exterior, which is
connected with a different manner of conceptual-
izing the point-like LM in the two systems. Pri-
marily, a different scope of reference of the gen-
eral internal location in the two languages be-
comes the source of divergence displayed by a
larger amount of details included in the spatial
relation of the Polish system. Also, the external
relation turns out not to possess ideal synonyms,
which this time stems from a wider scope of ref-
erence of the Polish preposition. All in all, there
is no strict translation equivalence between at
and any of the posited Polish translations. The
above cognitive account seems to be tenable at
least so much as to systematize the use of at in
relation to its main Polish counterparts and to
make the use of at easier for advanced Polish
users of English.

This type of relation works for both at and na + LOC. The tendency to indicate general location by means of na + LOC, as Sysak-Boronska (1980, page 70) notes, has grown since the 1960s in colloquial Polish, particularly with reference to the place of work. In such occurrences reference to buildings and institutions is made. Consider: (16) Mój tata pracuje na poczcie. ‘My father works at the post office.’ If the functional aspect of such use of na + LOC were present, as maintained by Awdiejew (1977, page 107), the verb byc ‘to be’ instead of pracowac ‘to work’, etc., should also bring some associations with an activity undertaken in the location. However, the sentence becomes rather ambiguous then: (17) Mój tata jest na poczcie. ’My father is at the post office.’ Unless some context is provided, (17) will indicate general location of the TR, mój tata ‘my father’, in the region of the LM, poczta ‘the post office’. Understandably, not all occurrences of na + LOC in such contexts are translatable with at: (18) Mój tata pracuje na kolei. ‘My father works for/*at the railway company.’ Theref</context>

As Bowerman (1996, page 160) observes, space is structured in different ways in different languages because “[l]anguages use surprisingly different criteria to calculate similarities and differences among spatial configurations, and this means that their spatial categories cross-cut and intersect each other in complex ways”. Thus, the disparate division of space in particular languages arises from the divergent culturedetermined conceptualization of entities in the description of spatial relations and the role assigned to the Trajector (TR) and LM in certain contexts. In addition, cross-linguistic differences </context>

As indicated by Klebanowska (1969, page 185), the TR is oriented towards the functional side of the LM, and hence is capable of using it. The functionality of the LM is present both in English and Polish. If there is no function present, the relation is still rendered by means of przy in Polish and by in English. Consider: (25) Martha is standing by the car. ‘Marta stoi przy samochodzie.’ A distinction must be made, however, for the relation where the TR takes the lateral position towards the LM, and when the LM is construed as a linear entity.

The point-like quality of the LM and the generality1 of the TR’s coincident location with regard to the LM are non-existent in Polish; the function that the LM serves seems not to be expressed by any preposition in Polish, either. If this is the case, one is tempted to investigate how the point-like LM is reflected in Polish and whether it has any regular exponents in the system of spatial relations or whether it is reflected in a rather irregular manner. Undoubt1 Obviously, the concept of ‘generality’ is subjective to a certain extent.

If there is no function present, the relation is still rendered by means of przy in Polish and by in English. Consider: (25) Martha is standing by the car. ‘Marta stoi przy samochodzie.’ A distinction must be made, however, for the relation where the TR takes the lateral position towards the LM, and when the LM is construed as a linear entity. The TR and the LM must be oriented towards each other vertically not horizontally, and both at and by are applicable: (26) He parked the car at/by the kerb. ‘Zaparkował samochód przy krawezniku.’ According to Przybylska (2002, pages 496- 497), the LM can also be idealized as a point in the przy-relation, which appears to be the most characteristic feature of at. All geometrical features of the LM are irrelevant – only the closeness of the TR to the LM, or their contact, is at issue. Consider the following example: (27) We met at the monument. ‘Spotkaligmy sip, przy pomniku.’ However, the extent to which the TR is used as a one-dimensional point in English with the use of at, and in Polish with przy, differs considerably, one-dimensional LMs being much more common in English. 6 At vs. u + LOC Occurrences of the pre</context>

In Polish, by contrast, it is still conceptualized as a threedimensional volume characterized by thickness and boundaries. Alternatively, a place can be conceptualized as a point on the map in order to be translated with w + LOC, as in: (11) her estates at Balmoral ‘jej posiadło§ci w Balmoral’ In (11) the Queen’s properties were being enumerated, and the concept of Great Britain as an island on the map was bound to appear in the speaker’s mind. As Sysak-Boronska (1980, page 39) observes, “with ‘point-apprehensibility’ being totally alien to the Polish system of locative concepts, there is at least one such discipline for which the notion of ‘point’ is fundamental and unavoidable.” Geometry appears to be the only discipline dealing with points, lines, planes and intersections in Polish. Below is an example quoted after Sysak-Boronska (1980, page 39): (12) Two circles cut at A and B. ‘Dwa okretgi przecinaj4 sip w punktach A i B.’ Apparently, the TR’s location is that of an idealized point both in English and Polish. Yet, in Polish the point is rendered as th</context>

A certain class of verbs tends to ap12 pear in such contexts which denote movement by the hand or a leg aiming at some point located on somebody’s body or on an object. The movement is rather violent and abrupt; hence, all types of throwing actions are involved: to throw sth at someone/something ‘rzucic czym§ w kogo§/co§’. In all these cases a point-like target is presupposed for at. However, in Polish the LM is construed as a container regardless of the limited amount of contact between the TR and LM. Sysak-Boronska (1980, page 42) remarks that it is the verbs that presuppose a point-like target. 4 At vs. na + LOC Na + LOC seems to constitute the closest Polish equivalent of the sense of at which indicates general internal location. This sense of at is represented by Subschema 1, where the LM, whose dimensions, size and shape are ignored, and which is conceptualized as a point, coincides with the TR. The coincidence of the two entities may involve the TR’s location within the LM’s interior or its region. Important is the fact that we can localize the TR with regard to the LM. Just as at conceptualizes the LM a</context>
<context position="16728" citStr="Sysak-Boronska (1980" startWordPosition="2927" endWordPosition="2928">sense of na does not necessarily imply contact between the TR and LM, a characteristic feature of the preposition, but rather forms some association between the two entities. Thus, it is the most appropriate equivalent of at in the following sentence: (15) He is waiting at the airport. ‘On czeka na lotnisku.’ In the above sentence we do not know where precisely the TR is located; what is known is only its approximate location with regard to the LM as the point of reference. This type of relation works for both at and na + LOC. The tendency to indicate general location by means of na + LOC, as Sysak-Boronska (1980, page 70) notes, has grown since the 1960s in colloquial Polish, particularly with reference to the place of work. In such occurrences reference to buildings and institutions is made. Consider: (16) Mój tata pracuje na poczcie. ‘My father works at the post office.’ If the functional aspect of such use of na + LOC were present, as maintained by Awdiejew (1977, page 107), the verb byc ‘to be’ instead of pracowac ‘to work’, etc., should also bring some associations with an activity undertaken in the location. However, the sentence becomes rather ambiguous then: (17) Mój tata jest na poczcie. ’My</context>

It has been observed that the closest equivalent of at disregarding the dimensional properties displayed by the LM is na + LOC. Sysak-Boronska (1980, pages 730-731), who has observed this regularity, does not hesitate to stress, however, that the preposition does not have an equal status with at in English. The restriction arises from the fact that this use of na is not well-established in all contexts, nor is it equally well received in all varieties of Polish. Thus, it must be noted that at from Subschema 1 and the colloquial na + LOC play a similar role in the respective spatial systems only to a limited extent. As for the conclusions ensuing from the comparison of external relations, although at constitutes the first translation of pr</context>

Consider example (6): (6) There are fewer fish at 2,000 metres below sea. Figure 6. Subschema 6 Subschema 6 construes the TR in space with precise or approximate measurement of distance. Thus, the LM is a point on the metric scale, as is depicted in Figure 6. The choice of the term dynamic for the last subschema of at can be justified by the TR’s movement towards the LM, as opposed to the static sense of at. Consider: (7) The tall man is aiming a dart at the bull’s eye. Also, it expresses the force dynamics aspect which is involved in the relation (cf. Talmy 1988). time Figure 7. Dynamic at In Figure 7, the TR is distant from the LM, but is moving in its direction along the trajectory marked with a broken arrow. The diagram does not indicate whether the TR reaches the LM; the arrow is coincident with the circular LM: although dynamic at does not indicate that the TR accomplishes the goal, it does not exclude such a possibility. The dynamic at relation construes a complex atemporal relation, as it is not reduced to a single consistent configuration, as was the case with the static scene (Langacker 1987, pages 220- 221). 3 At vs. w + LOC Polish w + LOC c</context>

The function of the place is usually implied, as in instances (29): 14 (29) Marie is at the butcher’s. ‘Maria jest u rzeznika.’ Sentence (29) indicates the reason why the TR, Marie, is at the butcher’s; namely, she wants to buy some meat. It is worth mentioning that the person indicated in the Saxon genitive does not have to be the one who provides the service. Instead of the butcher, it can be his assistant who sells meat. Understandably, some regular uses of u + GEN turn out to be untranslatable by at in English. As Topolinska (1984, pages 282-284) notes, there are a number of instances where u + GEN collocates with the name of a person, which implies the service that person provides but not the location. Consider (30): (30) Uczg sig angielskiego u profesor Kowalskiej. ‘I study English with professor Kowalska.’ *‘I am taught English at professor Kowalska’s.’ In the above example profesor Kowalska is the person who provides the service.

In addition, cross-linguistic differences emerge because the amount and kind of information that spatial descriptions routinely convey, and the situations that can be characterized readily in spatial terms, differ from language to language. Taking into consideration the way spatial relations are expressed by at in English, one may claim that few languages possess an equivalent of this preposition, with the rare exception of the French preposition d, analyzed by Vandeloise (1991, pages 157-185). Such a claim is expressed in the title of Cuyckens’s (1984) paper: “At: A typically English preposition”. Also, Cienki (1989, page 128) defines at as a “particularly English preposition”. Certainly, the semantic distinctions made by English speakers that require the use of at are not made by Slavic languages, such as Russian, analyzed by Cienki (1987, 1989) or Slovenian and Croatian, investigated by Šaric (2001). Neither are they made in Polish. As Cuyckens (1984, page 49) remarks, there is no close correspondence between the English at and its Polish translations, as there w</context>
