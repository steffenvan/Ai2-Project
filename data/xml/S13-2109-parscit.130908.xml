Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999312944444445">
For participating in the SemEval 2013 chal-
lenge of recognition and classification of
drug names, we adapted our chemical en-
tity recognition approach consisting in Condi-
tional Random Fields for recognizing chemi-
cal terms and lexical similarity for entity res-
olution to the ChEBI ontology. We obtained
promising results, with a best F-measure of
0.81 for the partial matching task when us-
ing post-processing. Using only Conditional
Random Fields the results are slightly lower,
achieving still a good result in terms of F-
measure. Using the ChEBI ontology allowed
a significant improvement in precision (best
precision of 0.93 in partial matching task),
which indicates that taking advantage of an
ontology can be extremely useful for enhanc-
ing chemical entity recognition.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999913157894737">
Most chemical named entity recognition systems
can be classified in two approaches: dictionary
based and machine learning based approaches. Dic-
tionary based approaches are usually easier to im-
plement and maintain, but require a reference chem-
ical term dictionary and are dependent on its com-
pleteness and quality. The availability of public
chemical databases has been an issue until recently,
when several publicly available databases such as
PubChem (Wang et al., 2009), DrugBank (Wishart
et al., 2006) and ChEBI (Degtyarenko et al., 2007)
were released. An example of a popular system that
uses this approach is Whatizit (Rebholz-Schuhmann
et al., 2008). Machine learning based approaches
are not limited to a terminology and are thus better
suited for finding novel chemical terms that are yet
to be inserted in reference databases. However this
approach requires training data for a classifier to be
able to successfully learn and perform the chemi-
cal entity recognition task. Some methods combine
both approaches and thus are hybrid systems that
aim to take the best out of both approaches (Jessop
et al., 2011; Rockt¨aschel et al., 2012).
An annotated corpus of patent documents was re-
leased by ChEBI, and using such corpus as train-
ing data we developed an chemical entity recogni-
tion system (Grego et al., 2009) that uses a ma-
chine learning approach based on Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001). We fur-
thermore expanded our method to allow resolution
of recognized entities to the ChEBI ontology (Grego
et al., 2012).
This paper describes how our system (Grego et
al., 2012) was adapted to perform the task of recog-
nition and classification of drug names, and presents
the results obtained in the task 9.1 of the 7th Interna-
tional Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval
2013).

<bodyText confidence="0.99989725">
The Task 9 of SemEval 2013 involved two sub-tasks:
(9.1) recognition and classification of drug names,
and (9.2) extraction of drug-drug interactions from
Biomedical Texts (SemEval, 2013). The recognition
and classification of drug names (Task 9.1) com-
prises two steps. First is chemical named entity
recognition, that consists in finding in a sentence
the offsets for the start and end of a chemical entity.

Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM), Volume 2: Seventh International Workshop on Semantic
Evaluation (SemEval 2013), pages 660–666, Atlanta, Georgia, June 14-15, 2013. c�2013 Association for Computational Linguistics
An exact match is achieved by correctly identifying
both the start and end offset, as curators manually
provided them. If there is a mismatch in the offsets
but there is some overlap with a manual annotation,
then it is considered a partial match, otherwise it is
a recognition error.
The second step consists in classifying each rec-
ognized entity in one of four possible entity types:
i) Drug is any pharmaceutical product approved for
human use; ii) Brand is a drug that was first devel-
oped by a pharmaceutical company; iii) Group refers
to a class or group of drugs; iv) Drug n is an ac-
tive substance that has not been approved for human
use. Thus, the evaluation takes into account not only
entity recognition, but also the assigned type. Type
matching assessment considers the entity type evalu-
ation from partial matching entity recognition, while
strict matching considers the entity type evaluation
from exact matching.
For training, the DDI corpus dataset was provided
(Segura-Bedmar et al., 2006). This dataset contains
two sub-datasets. One that consists of MedLine ab-
stracts, and other that contains DrugBank abstracts.
An unannotated test dataset was provided for testing
and evaluating the systems.

3 CRF entity recognition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998200322033898">
Our method uses CRFs for building probabilis-
tic models based on training datasets. We used
the MALLET (McCallum, 2002) implementation of
CRFs. MALLET is a Java-based package for sta-
tistical natural language processing, document clas-
sification, clustering, topic modeling, information
extraction, and other machine learning applications
to text, which includes an implementation of linear
chain CRFs.
A required first step in our method in the tok-
enization of the input text. For this task we have
used a specifically adapted tokenizer for chemical
text adapted from an open source project (Corbett et
al., 2007).
Each token is then represented as a set of features.
We kept using a set of features derived in our previ-
ous work (Grego et al., 2009), which includes for
each token:
Stem: The stem of the token.
Prefix: The first three characters of the token.
Suffix: The last three characters of the token.
Number: Boolean that indicates if the token con-
tains digits.
In addition to the set of features, each token is also
given a label in accordance to the training data:
NO: A non-chemical token.
NE: A chemical entity represented by a single to-
ken.
S-NE: The first token of a multi-token chemical en-
tity.
M-NE: A middle token of a multi-token chemi-
cal entity (only exists for entities composed by
three or more tokens).
E-NE: The last token of a multi-token chemical en-
tity.
The task of entity recognition will be the assign-
ment of such labels to new, unannotated text, based
on a model. The assigned label allows for named
entities to be recognized and offsets provided.
For creating a model, it is required as input a set
of annotated documents. Our method was initially
developed using an annotated patent document cor-
pus released to the public by the ChEBI team. This
corpus can be found at 1, and we decided to keep us-
ing it as training data for a model. Together with this
corpus, the DDI corpus training dataset provided for
the task was used. The model produced by using
this combination of training data, that we called All
model, will be suited for general purpose chemical
entity recognition.
We then prepared four datasets based on the DDI
corpus dataset but containing only one type of anno-
tated entities each. With that training data we pre-
pared four more models, each trained only with one
kind on entity type. Thus we have in total prepared
five models:
All: A model trained with all entity types of the DDI
corpus dataset, and the ChEBI released patent
dataset.

Using the type specific models it is possible to
annotate text with only one entity type. Thus our
method now has the capability of entity type classifi-

these type specific models.

4 ChEBI resolution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948206896552">
After having recognized the named chemical enti-
ties, our method tries to perform their resolution to
the ChEBI ontology. ChEBI (Chemical Entities of
Biological Interest) is a freely available dictionary
of small molecular entities. In addition to molecular
entities, ChEBI contains groups (parts of molecular
entities) and classes of entities, allowing for an onto-
logical classification that specifies the relationships
between molecular entities or classes of entities and
their parents and/or children. The ontology structure
provides an integrated overview of the relationships
between chemical entities, both structural and func-
tional.
The resolution method takes as input the string
identified as being a chemical compound name and
returns the most relevant ChEBI identifier along
with a confidence score.
To perform the search for the most likely ChEBI
term for a given entity an adaptation of FiGO, a
lexical similarity method (Couto et al., 2005). Our
adaptation compares the constituent words in the in-
put string with the constituent words of each ChEBI
term, to which different weights have been assigned
according to its frequency in the ontology vocabu-
lary (Grego et al., 2012). A resolution score between
0 and 1 is provided with the mapping, which corre-
sponds to a maximum value in the case of a ChEBI
term that has the exact name as the input string, and
is lower otherwise.

5 Post-processing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987176470588">
To further improve the quality of the annotations
provided by our method, some naive rules were cre-
ated and external resources used.
One of the rules implemented is derived from the
resolution process, and corresponds in classifying
an entity as type Group if its ChEBI name is plu-
ral. This is because ChEBI follows the convention
of naming its terms always as a singular name, ex-
cept for terms that represent classes of entities where
a plural name can be used.
We have also used other resources in the post-
processing besides ChEBI, namely a list of brand
names extracted from DrugBank. This list of brand
names was used to check if a given entity was part
of that list, and if it was the entity should be of the
type Brand.
A common English words list was also used as ex-
ternal resource in post-processing. If a recognized
chemical entity was part of this list then it was a
recognition error and should be filtered out and not
be considered a chemical entity.
Some simple rules were also implemented in an
effort to improve the quality of the annotations. For
instance, if the recognized entity was found to be
composed entirely by digits, then it should be fil-
tered out because it is most certainly an annotation
error. Also, if an entity starts or ends with a char-
acter such as “*”, “-”, “.”, “,” or “’”, then those
characters should be removed from the entity and the
offsets corrected accordingly.
With such naive but efficient rules it was expected
that the performance of entity recognition would im-
prove. An overview of the system architecture is
provided in Figure 1.

type is Brand, else if it was recognized using
the Group model, then type is Group, else and
finally it is assigned the type Drug. Resolution
to ChEBI is performed and all of the described
post-processing rules applied.
Run 2: In this run only the classifiers are used. This
means that the entity recognition is performed
using all models, and the type classification is
performed by using the type specific models as
described in Run 1. However no extra process-
ing is performed and the results are submitted
as obtained directly from the classifiers.
Run 3: This run performs entity recognition in
a similar way described in run 1, and per-
forms entity recognition to the ChEBI ontol-
ogy. However, only the entities successfully
mapped to ChEBI, with a resolution score of
at least 0.8, are considered. All the other en-
tities are discarded in this phase. After reso-
lution and the filtering of entities according to
the resolution to ChEBI, all the described post-
processing rules are applied in a similar way to
Run 1.

7 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986790697675">
The official evaluation results are presented in Ta-
ble 1. We can observe that the obtained results are
better for the DrugBank dataset than for the Med-
Line dataset. This may have happened because the
DrugBank dataset is four times larger than the Med-
Line dataset, but also because while the DrugBank
abstracts are quite focused in drug descriptions and
use mostly systematic names, the MedLine ones are
usually more generic and make more extensive use
of trivial drug names. We obtained for the Run 1 a
top F-measure of 0.81 in the full dataset for a par-
tial matching assessment, and that value decreased
to 0.78 when an exact matching assessment is con-
sidered. The values are very close, which means that
our method is being able to efficiently find the cor-
rect offsets of the entities. However the F-measure
decreases to 0.69 for partial matching and 0.66 for
exact matching when the assignment of the entity
type is considered. This means that there is room to
improve in the task of classifying the chemical enti-
ties to the correct entity type.
Run 2 obtained results very similar to Run 1, only
slightly less F-measure. The difference between
those two runs was that Run 2 used only the classi-
fiers, while Run 1 used rules and external resources
in an effort to improve the results. We can thus con-
clude that the classifiers alone produce already good
results and more sophisticated post-processing is re-
quired to obtain significant performance gains. Our
post-processing was very simple as explained ear-
lier, and can only slightly improve the results ob-
tained with the CRF classifiers alone.
Run 3 obtained improved precision in all assess-
ments. In this run only the entities that were success-
fully mapped to ChEBI were considered, and thus
the precision of recognition was the best of our runs.
This is because ChEBI contains high quality, man-
ually validated chemical terms. If a recognized en-
tity can be successfully mapped to this data source,
then there is a good indication that it is, in fact, a
valid chemical entity. However F-measure has de-
creased because of a loss in recall. ChEBI is still a
young project containing slightly over 30,000 chem-

ical entities, which is still a low amount of entities
when compared with other chemical databases (for
example, PubChem contains more than 10 times that
amount). However ChEBI is growing at a steady
pace and we believe its coverage will keep increas-
ing while maintaining the high quality that allows
for an excellent precision. Thus, as ChEBI evolves,
our approach will mantain the high levels of preci-
sion but with a lower reduction in recall.
ChEBI is not only a chemical dictionary, but
an ontology. This allows for a comparison recog-
nized entities through semantic similarity measures
that can be used to further enhance chemical en-
tity recognition (Ferreira and Couto , 2010; Couto
and Silva, 2011). This comparison can also be ex-
tremely useful in other task such as drug-drug inter-
action extraction. Moreover, even if with a relatively
small ChEBI, it can be possible to increase coverage
by integrating other available resources using Ontol-
ogy Matching techniques (Faria et al., 2012).
In Table 2 we have the official results obtained
for each entity type, and we can observe that our
method is efficient in correctly classifying the Drug
and Group types, where it achieves an F-measure
of 0.74 and 0.71 correspondingly. However our
method has some difficulties in correctly classify-
ing entities of the Brand type, where an F-measure
of 0.58 was obtained. The Drug n entity type has
proven to be a very challenging type to be correctly
classified, and our system failed the correct classi-
fication of this type in most situations. This is pos-
sibly because the percentage of entities of this type
is very limited, and also because the difference be-
tween this type and the Drug type is the fact that
the later has been approved for human use, while
the former has not. The feature set used cannot ef-
ficiently discriminate this information and external
information about drug approval for human usage
must be used for efficient detection of this type.
Overall, Run 1 has obtained the best results. How-
ever, the results from Run 2 have been very similar,
which shows that the classifiers have been success-
ful and the post-processing of Run 1 has been mini-
mal. Run 3 was designed for high precision, because
only the entities successfully mapped to the ChEBI
ontology were considered. It does improve the ob-
tained precision, but suffers a drop in recall. Table 3
presents the macro-average measures obtained for
each run.

This paper presents our participation in the 7th In-
ternational Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (Se-
mEval 2013) using a CRF-based chemical entity
recognition method and a lexical similarity based
resolution method. We prepared type-specific CRF
models to allow both recognition and type classifi-
cation of the chemical entities. Mapping of the en-
tities to the ChEBI ontology was performed using
a lexical similarity based method, and several post-
processing rules using external resources where im-
plemented.
We submitted different runs on annotated test data
using different combination of such methods, and
obtained a best precision of 0.89 and a best F-
measure of 0.81 in the entity recognition task. For
the task of entity recognitions and classification we
have obtained a best precision of 0.78 and a best F-
measure of 0.69. We concluded that the classifiers
provide already good results by their own, that can
be slightly improved by using some naive external
resources and rules.
However, using ChEBI allows for a significant in-
crease of precision, which is encouraging. We be-
lieve this result is a good indication that as ChEBI
matures, the methods that take advantage of its on-
tology structure for entity recognition and classifica-
tion will benefit more from its usage, increasing the
F-measure obtained in the task.

Dep. de Faculdade de Universidade de fcouto@di.fc.ul.pt Abstract For participating in the SemEval 2013 challenge of recognition and classification of drug names, we adapted our chemical entity recognition approach consisting in Conditional Random Fields for recognizing chemical terms and lexical similarity for entity resolution to the ChEBI ontology. We obtained promising results, with a best F-measure of 0.81 for the partial matching task when using post-processing. Using only Conditional Random Fields the results are slightly lower, achieving still a good result in terms of Fmeasure. Using the ChEBI ontology allowed a significant improvement in precision (best precision of 0.93 in partial matching task), which indicates that taking advantage of an ontology can be extremely useful for enhancing chemical entity recognition.</abstract>

However ChEBI is growing at a steady pace and we believe its coverage will keep increasing while maintaining the high quality that allows for an excellent precision. Thus, as ChEBI evolves, our approach will mantain the high levels of precision but with a lower reduction in recall. ChEBI is not only a chemical dictionary, but an ontology. This allows for a comparison recognized entities through semantic similarity measures that can be used to further enhance chemical entity recognition (Ferreira and Couto , 2010; Couto and Silva, 2011).

Dictionary based approaches are usually easier to implement and maintain, but require a reference chemical term dictionary and are dependent on its completeness and quality. The availability of public chemical databases has been an issue until recently, when several publicly available databases such as PubChem (Wang et al., 2009), DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2006) and ChEBI (Degtyarenko et al., 2007) were released. An example of a popular system that uses this approach is Whatizit (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2008). Machine learning based approaches are not limited to a terminology and are thus better suited for finding novel chemical terms that are yet to be inserted in reference databases. However this approach requires training data for a classifier to be able to successfully learn and perform the chemical entity recognition task. Some methods combine both approaches and thus are hybrid systems that aim to take the best out of both approaches (Jessop et al., 2011; Rockt¨aschel et al., 20</context>

Type matching assessment considers the entity type evaluation from partial matching entity recognition, while strict matching considers the entity type evaluation from exact matching. For training, the DDI corpus dataset was provided (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2006). This dataset contains two sub-datasets. One that consists of MedLine abstracts, and other that contains DrugBank abstracts. An unannotated test dataset was provided for testing and evaluating the systems. 3 CRF entity recognition Our method uses CRFs for building probabilistic models based on training datasets. We used the MALLET (McCallum, 2002) implementation of CRFs. MALLET is a Java-based package for statistical natural language processing, document classification, clustering, topic modeling, information extraction, and other machine learning applications to text, which includes an implementation of linear chain CRFs. A required first step in our method in the tokenization of the input text. For this task we have used a specifically adapted tokenizer for chemical text adapted from an open source project (Corbett et al., 2007). Each token is then represented as a set of features. We kept using a set of features derived in our previ</context>

Dictionary based approaches are usually easier to implement and maintain, but require a reference chemical term dictionary and are dependent on its completeness and quality. The availability of public chemical databases has been an issue until recently, when several publicly available databases such as PubChem (Wang et al., 2009), DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2006) and ChEBI (Degtyarenko et al., 2007) were released. An example of a popular system that uses this approach is Whatizit (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2008). Machine learning based approaches are not limited to a terminology and are thus better suited for finding novel chemical terms that are yet to be inserted in reference databases. However this approach requires training data for a classifier to be able to successfully learn and perform the chemical entity recognition task. Some methods combine both approaches and thus are hybrid systems that aim to take the best out of both approaches (Jessop et al., 2011; Rockt¨aschel et al., 2012).

We furthermore expanded our method to allow resolution of recognized entities to the ChEBI ontology (Grego et al., 2012). This paper describes how our system (Grego et al., 2012) was adapted to perform the task of recognition and classification of drug names, and presents the results obtained in the task 9.1 of the 7th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2013). 2 Task and Dataset The Task 9 of SemEval 2013 involved two sub-tasks: (9.1) recognition and classification of drug names, and (9.2) extraction of drug-drug interactions from Biomedical Texts (SemEval, 2013). The recognition and classification of drug names (Task 9.1) comprises two steps. First is chemical named entity recognition, that consists in finding in a sentence the offsets for the start and end of a chemical entity. 660 Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM), Volume 2: Seventh International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2013), pages 660–666, </context>

However, the results from Run 2 have been very similar, which shows that the classifiers have been successful and the post-processing of Run 1 has been minimal. Run 3 was designed for high precision, because only the entities successfully mapped to the ChEBI ontology were considered. It does improve the obtained precision, but suffers a drop in recall. Table 3 presents the macro-average measures obtained for each run. 8 Conclusions This paper presents our participation in the 7th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2013) using a CRF-based chemical entity recognition method and a lexical similarity based resolution method. We prepared type-specific CRF models to allow both recognition and type classification of the chemical entities. Mapping of the entities to the ChEBI ontology was performed using a lexical similarity based method, and several postprocessing rules using external resources where implemented. We submitted different runs on annotated test data using different combination of such methods, and obtained a best precision of 0.89 and a best Fmeasure of 0.81 in the entity recognition task.
