<bodyText confidence="0.9998346">
Conversationally relevant descriptions are definite
descriptions that are not merely tools for the iden-
tification of a referent, but are also crucial to the dis-
course in other respects. I analyse the uses of such
descriptions in assertions as conveying a particular
type of conversational implicatures. Such implica-
tures can be represented within the framework of
possible world semantics. The analysis is extended
to non-assertive illocutionary acts on the one hand,
and to indefinite descriptions on the other.

2 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944272727273">
In an earlier paper [Kronfeld 19861, I have intro-
duced the distinction between functionally and con-
versationally relevant descriptions. All uses of def-
inite descriptions for the purpose of referring are
functional in the sense that they are supposed to
identify the referent. But some uses of definite de-
scriptions exhibit a type of relevance (or irrelevance)
that goes beyond identification purposes. Consider
the following example. As part of his effort to re-
cruit more young people into the police force, the
mayor of New York proclaims in a public speech:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.942194" genericHeader="method">
1 New York needs more policemen.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999576307692308">
Instead of &amp;quot;New York&apos; he might have used &amp;quot;The Big
Apple,&apos; or &amp;quot;The city by the Hudson,&apos; or some such
description. It would not do, however, to say that
2 The city with the world&apos;s largest Jewish
community needs more policemen
even though this description might be useful enough
in identifying New York for the audience. It is sim-
ply irrelevant in this context. On the other hand,
this same description might be quite relevant in a
different context. For example, suppose the mayor
were giving a speech at a reception in honor of Is-
rael&apos;s Prime Minister. Under those circumstances,
the statement
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.719728333333333" genericHeader="method">
3 The city with the world&apos;s largest Jewish
community welcomes Israel&apos;s Prime
Minister.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974222222222">
would make perfect sense. The difference, of course,
is in the relevance of the description to the state-
ment in (3), and its irrelevance to the one in (2).
Uses of definite descriptions such as illustrated in
example (3), are what I call conversationally rele-
vant.
The distinction between functionally and conver-
sationally relevant descriptions is part of a general
model of referring that is based on what I have
termed the descriptive approach to reference [Kron-
feld 19901. An elucidation of the speech act of refer-
ring cannot be complete without understanding the
role of conversationally relevant descriptions in the
larger discourse. My hypothesis in [Kronfeld 1986]
was that conversationally relevant descriptions func-
tion as part of implicatures of a particular type. The
problem is to specify what this type is. An outline
of a solution is the topic of the present paper.

3 Implicature
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999867">
Why should we think that whenever a conversation-
ally relevant description is used an implicature al-
ways exists? The reason for this has to do with
the fact that discourse is something more than a
simple sum of the isolated sentences that constitute
its parts. Discourse consists of a sequence of ut-
terances that are tied together in ways that make
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999660347826087">
sense. Typically, there are reasons why a speaker
says what he says in the order and manner that
he says it, and in general a hearer must have a
clue as to what these reasons are (this is why plan
recognition is so important for plan-based theories
of speech acts). Of course, the hearer cannot hope
to know or even guess all of the reasons that led the
speaker to participate in the discourse, but he can,
indeed must, recognise some of them. As Allen, Co-
hen, Gross, Perrault, and Sidner have pointed out
[Allen 1978; Perrault and Cohen 1978; Allen and
Perrault 1978; Allen and Perrault 1980; Grosz and
Sidner 1986; Sidner 1983; Sidner 19851, the recog-
nition of what the speaker is &apos;up to&apos; contributes
to coherence and comprehensibility of the discourse
and is essential for the hearer&apos;s generation of an ap-
propriate response.
Now, the unstated reasons whose recognition is
required for discourse coherence are by definition
implicated, since they must be inferred in order to
preserve the assumption that the speaker is being
cooperative. This is precisely what an implicature
is. Moreover, turning to conversationally relevant
descriptions, we should observe that by their very
nature, they cannot be merely functionally relevant.
That is, the assumption that they are intended
merely as tools for identification is not enough to
make the discourse coherent. This, after all, is pre-
cisely what distinguishes functionally relevant de-
scriptions from the conversationally relevant ones.
Hence, additional assumptions are required in order
to make sense of the way the speaker uses the latter
descriptions. These assumptions themselves must
be implicated.
Thus, in using a conversationally relevant descrip-
tion, the speaker implicates something. The con-
tent of implicatures that accompany such descrip-
tions depends on circumstances, but they all share
a rather specific form. My method in uncovering
this form is this: taking the hearer&apos;s perspective, I
begin by postulating that if the referring expression
used by the speaker is merely functionally relevant,
the speaker must be viewed as uncooperative. I then
outline a sequence of deductions that eliminate the
apparent conflict between what the speaker says and
the assumption of his cooperation.

3.1 Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973346153846">
The general mechanism for the recognition of a con-
versationally relevant description follows the famil-
iar Gricean path. The hearer begins by assuming
that the referring expression is only functionally
relevant, and then gets into difficulties. An obvi-
ous strategy is illustrated by Example (3) above.
At first glance it appears that the mayor violated
the third maxim of manner (&amp;quot;Be brief&amp;quot;): he used
a long and cumbersome description (&amp;quot;the city with
the largest Jewish community&amp;quot;), although a much
shorter and functionally superior one is available
(&amp;quot;New York&amp;quot;). However, a hearer can easily make
sense of the mayor&apos;s behavior by assuming that the
referring expression is not merely a tool for identifi-
cation. That is, it must be conversationally relevant.
Another strategy for letting the hearer recog-
nize a conversationally relevant description is illus-
trated by &apos;Smith&apos;s murderer&apos; (interpreted &apos;attribu-
tively&amp;quot;). There, the assumption that the description
is only functionally relevant would lead to an inex-
plicable violation of the second maxim of quality.
It is obvious that no one knows yet who murdered
Smith. Thus, if the description is only functionally
relevant, the hearer would be puzzled as to how the
speaker could form an opinion about the sanity of a
person whose identity is unknown to him.

3.2 Asserted universality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999322">
When a conversationally relevant description is used
(or implied), the proposition which the speaker is
trying to express lends itself to the Russellian anal-
ysis. Thus, if a speaker asserts a statement of the
form
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.825692" genericHeader="method">
4 The D is F,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996834">
and `The D&apos; is a conversationally relevant descrip-
tion, then the proposition eacpessed by the speaker
is this:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.52666" genericHeader="method">
5 (3x)(D(x) &amp; (Vy)(D(y) x = y) &amp; F(x)).1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9880184">
Note that (5) is equivalent to the conjunction of
two propositions. The first one is the uniqueness
condition:
6 (Uniqueness) (3z)(D(z) (16 (Vy)(D(y) z = y)).
The second is a universal generalization:
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.796194" genericHeader="method">
7 (Universality) (Vz)(D(z) -4 F(z)).
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994387">
Both the uniqueness and the universality condi-
tions have to be satisfied if what the speaker means
is to be true. But from this it does not follow that
the speaker asserts these conditions. Both Straw-
son 119711 and following him Searle 11969, 157ff.1
have argued in their criticism of Russell&apos;s theory of
descriptions that the uniqueness condition, though
presupposed, is not asserted. For example, when
a speaker says that the Queen of England is ill, he
does not assert that there is one and only one Queen

of England. This, no doubt, is true of the unique-
ness condition, but I think that when a conversa-
tionally relevant description is used, the universal-
ity condition is indeed asserted, or at least strongly
implied. In a sense, what the speaker attempts to
convey is that any object that is denoted by the
description `the D&apos; has the property F, and this
is why it is so natural to insert &amp;quot;whoever he is&apos; in
the classical examples of attributive uses of definite
descriptions. By saying &apos;Smith&apos;s murderer, who-
ever he is, is insane&apos; the speaker obviously means
that for any person, if that person is Smith&apos;s mur-
derer, that person is insane, which has the exact
same form as (7). Note that the convention for us-
ing definite descriptions to express universal state-
ments already exists in the language (`The whale
is a mammal&apos; i.e., for any x, if x is a whale, then
x is a mammal). Moreover, very frequently, when
a conversationally relevant description is used, the
speaker would maintain that the universality con-
dition is true even if uniqueness fails. Suppose it
turns out that not one but two culprits are respon-
sible for Smith&apos;s sorry state. If our speaker asserted
that Smith&apos;s murderer, whoever he is, is insane, he
is very likely to say now that both are insane, rather
than withdraw his judgment altogether. All in all,
it seems to me very plausible to assume that when
conversationally relevant descriptions are used, the
universal claim is not only part of the truth condi-
tions (together with uniqueness), but part of what
is asserted as well.

3.3 Justification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996110971428571">
A rational speaker who follows the Gricean max-
izns is expected, among other things, to obey the
second maxim of quality. That is, he is expected to
have &apos;adequate evidence&amp;quot; for what he asserts. What
counts as adequate evidence obviously depends on
context: we have different standards for assertions
in a scientific article and in a gossipy chat. Nev-
ertheless in all verbal exchanges, a speaker is ex-
pected to be able to provide reasonable justification
for what he says. He must be able to answer ques-
tions such as &apos;how do you know?&apos; why do you
think so?&apos; and so on. If he cannot, the assumption
about his cooperation cannot be maintained.
If a universal statement such as (7) is part of what
the speaker asserts, he must be able, then, to jus-
tify it. The hearer may not know exactly what the
speaker&apos;s evidence is for believing this generaliza-
tion but the hearer can reason about the type of ev-
idence or justification that the speaker is expected
to have. In particular, I want to draw a distinction
between extensional and intensional justifications
of universal statements. This distinction will help
us see what sort of justification a speaker can offer
for a statement such as (7) when a conversationally
relevant description is used.
The distinction between extensional and inten-
sional justification of universal statements is based
on a familiar distinction in the philosophy of sci-
ence between accidental and lawlike generalisations
(See Walters 1967). Not all universal generalisa-
tions are scientific laws. For example, the following
statement, although true, is not a law of nature:
8 All mountains on Earth are less than 30,000
feet high.
On the other hand, this next statement is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.79222">
9 All basketballs are attracted to the center
of Earth.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999657">
What is the difference? Well, there are several,
but two related ones are specifically relevant to us.
First, the latter generalisation, but not the former,
supports counterfactual statement. If a mountain
on Earth were to be examined a billion years from
now, would it still be less than 30,000 feet high? We
don&apos;t know. Changes in the surface of the earth oc-
cur all the time, and Mount Everest needs a mere
972 additional feet to make (8) false. On the other
hand, if a player were to make a jump shot a billion
years from now the basketball would still find its
way down to the ground. A law of nature does not
lose its validity over time.
Second, there is a crucial difference in the man-
ner in which statements (8) and (9) are justified.
The generalization about mountains on earth is sup-
ported by observation: all mountains on earth were
measured and found to be less than 30,000 feet high.
I do not know why this is so. As far as I am con-
cerned this is just one more accidental fact about
the world I live in. The generalization about bas-
ketballs, on the other hand, is derived from a more
general principle that explains why things such as
basketballs behave the way they do. Such a deriva-
tion is an essential part of an explanation of why (9)
is true. It also contributes to the coherence of our
experience: what science provides us with, among
other things, is the reassuring knowledge that nat-
ural phenomena do not just happen to occur, but
follow a general scheme that provides the basis for
both explanation and prediction. Thus, our confi-
dence in the truth of (9) is not merely the result of
examining a large sample of basketballs. We also
have a theory that explains why they do not just
happen to come down whenever dropped, but, in a
sense, must do so.
Given these two differences between accidental
and lawlike statements, let extensional and inten-
sional justifications of universal generalizations be
defined as follows. An extensional justification of a
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941740740741">
generalisation such as &amp;quot;All A&apos;s are F&apos; would rely on
the fact that all, or most, or a good sample of the
things with the property A have been examined and
were found to have property F. In such a case there
would not be any attempt to explain why this is so,
only a claim that as things stand, all A&apos;s do, in fact,
have the property F. An intensional justification of
a universal generalization, on the other hand, would
attempt to show that anything with the property of
being A must have the property of being F, because
of a more general principle or theory from which the
generalization can be derived.2
The distinction I have just described is obviously
not restricted to science, nor am I interested in elu-
cidating different scientific methods of corrobora-
tion. Rather, I want to apply this distinction to
the kind of justification that a speaker is expected
to have for what he says, in view of Grice&apos;s second
maxim of quality. In a sense, what I am after is a
&apos;folk theory&apos; of justification, not the foundation of
knowledge. Thus, the extensional/intensional dis-
tinction between types of justification is indifferent
to the question whether the evidence for a statement
is good or bad, as an intensional justification can be
either silly or brilliant. Moreover, the distinction
applies to all sorts of judgments, not merely theo-
retical ones. The biggotted justification for holding
stereotypic beliefs would presumably be extensional
(&amp;quot;Look, I don&apos;t know why they are all such dirty
cowards, but I have met enough of them to know
that they are?). On the other hand, when the
notorious fundamentalist preacher Jimmy Swaggart
states that all adulterers are sinners, he does not
intend us to believe that he has examined all (most,
enough) adulterers and found that they happen to
be sinners. If someone who is not an adulterer now
would become one, he would have to be a sinner
as well, and the reason for that is simple. Within
Swaggart&apos;s world view, adulterers must be sinners
simply because the bible says so, and whatever the
bible says is true. The same distinction applies to
the most mundane generalizations that can appear
in discourse. &apos;All the nursery schools in our area are
simply unacceptable&apos; my friend tells me. I assume
the justification for what he says is extensional (he
has checked out each and every one), but then he
adds: &amp;quot;... they are all Montessori schools,&apos; and an
intensional justification is revealed.
Clearly, extensional and intensional justification
are not mutually exclusive. Nor do they exhaust the
types of justification one can use. Thus, the justi-
fication of the most fundamental principles of any
theory (scientific or otherwise), although clearly not
extensional, would not be intensional either, since
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.435159">
2Statistical correlations belong to the extensional realm.
Causal explanations to the intensional one.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932304347826">
by definition they are not derivable from any other
principles (they would still support counterfactuals,
though). However, apart from such fundamental
axioms, the justification of any universal general-
ization, if it is not extensional, must be intensional
Now back to the universality condition that the
speaker asserts when he uses a conversationally rel-
evant description. As mentioned already, the hearer
may not know why the speaker believes the general-
ization, but from the hearer&apos;s point of view it stands
to reason that the speaker&apos;s justification is inten-
sional, because of the uniqueness condition. If the
uniqueness condition is presupposed, an extensional
justification of the universal generalisation amounts
to no more than this: there is evidence that the ref-
erent happens to have the property F. But if this
were all that the speaker had in mind, it would be
very misleading to give the impression that a univer-
sal generalization was meant. To see why, consider a
case in which an author tells you that all his books
are published by Cambridge University Press. If
later you are to find out that he has published only
one book, you would surely be puzzled, although
as things are, his statement was technically true.
In other words, if the uniqueness condition is pre-
supposed, it makes little sense to assert a universal
generalization, unless the speaker believes that the
generalisation must be true whether the uniqueness
condition is true or not. Thus, if the speaker has in-
tensional justification for what he says, the unique-
ness condition no longer interferes with universality.
If the author tells you that he has just signed a life-
time contract with Cambridge University Press, and
therefore all his books must be published there, the
fact that he has written only one book (so far) does
not matter any more. In view of the contract, if he
were to write others, they would be published by
Cambridge.
For the speech act to be coherent, therefore, the
speaker must have an intensional justification for
(7). This is why frequently when a conversation-
ally relevant description is used (for example, in the
paradigmatically &apos;attributive&apos; uses of definite de-
scriptions), it is natural to replace the auxiliary verb
with an appropriately tensed occurrence of &amp;quot;must.&apos;
For example,
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9425667">
My hypothesis, therefore, is that conversationally
relevant descriptions are used to assert universal
generalisations for which the speaker has intensional
justification. Therefore, when a speaker says &amp;quot;The
D is F&apos; and &amp;quot;The D&apos; is conversationally relevant,
a first approximation of what is usually being im-
plicated is this:
13 Any D must be F.
When the modal verb is actually added, the speaker
simply makes (part of) the implicature explicit.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991074">
3.4 The meaning of &amp;quot;must&amp;quot;
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999075">
As it stands, the implicature expressed by (13) is
hopelessly vague. The problem is with the modal
verb &amp;quot;must.&apos; How is it to be interpreted? Compare,
for example, the following uses:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978042166666667">
14 (a) The bird must have entered through
the attic.
(b) Whether I like it or not, I must pay
my taxes.
(c) The Butcher of Lion must pay for his
crimes.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994388147540984">
If 1 do not pay my taxes, I will be punished. This is
why I feel that I must do it. But if the bird did not
enter through the attic, or if the Butcher of Lion
does not pay for his crimes, neither bird nor beast
will be punished as a result of that. Moreover, if the
bird did not enter through the attic, the speaker ut-
tering 14(a) would simply be wrong. But whether or
not the Butcher of Lion ever pays for his crimes, the
speaker uttering 14(c) would nevertheless be right.
Thus, in each case, the intended interpretation of
the modal verb is radically different.
Is the word &amp;quot;must&amp;quot; multiply ambiguous then?
Not necessarily. As Angelika Kratser has argued
[1977; 1979; 19811, the force of modal verbs such as
&apos;must&apos; is relative to an implied contextual element.
The examples in 14 are elliptical pronouncements
whose full meaning can be given by the following:
In view of what we know, the bird
must have entered through the attic.
In view of what the law is, I must pay
my taxes, whether I like it or not.
In view of our moral convictions, the
Butcher of Lion must pay for his
crimes.
The interpretation of &amp;quot;must&amp;quot; in each example is
indeed different, but there is, Kratzer argues, a core
of meaning which is common to all. This core is
specified as a function that can be precisely formu-
lated within the framework of possible-world seman-
tics. Schematically, Kratser&apos;s suggestion is that the
meaning of &amp;quot;must&apos; is given by the function must-
in-view-of, which accepts two arguments. One ar-
gument is the proposition within the scope of the
modal verb (e.g., The bird came through the attic in
14(a)). Values for the other argument are phrases
such as &apos;what is known,&apos; &apos;what the law is,&apos; our
moral convictions,&apos; etc. Thus, for example, sen-
tence 15(a) is interpreted as
18 Must-In-View-Of(What is known, The
bird entered through he attic)
The sentence is true in possible world w just in
case the proposition expressed by &apos;The bird entered
through the attic&apos; logically follows from what we
know in w [Kratser 1977, 3461.3
Kratser&apos;s suggestion can be used in the elucida-
tion of the implicature conveyed by a conversation-
ally relevant description. Let f stand for phrases
such as &amp;quot;what is known,&apos; &amp;quot;What the law is,&apos; etc.
Applying Kratser&apos;s analysis to (13) we get
17 In view of f, any D must be F.
or more accurately:
18 Must-In-View-0g/, any D is F).
(18), then, is the implicature conveyed by a typical
use of a conversationally relevant description. How
&amp;quot;in view off&apos; is to be interpreted is up to the hearer
to find out, but we may assume that possible val-
ues for f come from a list that is scanned by the
hearer until a particular item on the list provides a
satisfactory interpretation. Such a list may contain
the following (see Kratser 1981, 44-45, for possible-
world interpretation):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.867129">
• Factual: In view of facts of such and such
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.940694736842105">
kinds... (including institutional facts such as
what the law is).
3Phrases such as &apos;what is known,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;our moral convic-
tions,&apos; what the facts are,&amp;quot; and so on are represented by
Kratser as functions from possible worlds to sets of proposi-
tions. For example, &amp;quot;what is known&amp;quot; is represented as a func-
tion f which assigns sets of propositions to possible worlds
such that for each possible world w, f(w) contains all the
propositions that are known in that world. According to
Kratzer&apos;s first suggestion, for any function f from worlds to
sets of propositions, and for every proposition P, &amp;quot;It must be
the case that P in view of f&amp;quot; is true in w just in case f(w)
entails P. As Kratser notes, this is only the first step in the
elucidation of the meaning of modal verbs, and it works only
when ,f(w) is guaranteed to be consistent (as is indeed the
case when f is &amp;quot;what is known&amp;quot;). When f(w) can be incon-
sistent (e.g., when f is what the law is), problems arise, which
Kratzer solves using the concept of the set of all consistent
subsets.

While the list may turn out to be much longer, there

The assumption that a conversationally relevant
description is used to implicate a modal operator
provides a formal reason why in paradigmatically
attributive uses, if nothing fits the description, the
speech act as a whole must fail. If (18) is part of
what the speaker means in these cases, the descrip-
tion is within the scope of a modal operator, hence,
within an intensional context in which substitution
is not guaranteed to be a valid form of inference.
Suppose that Ralph asserts that in view of what
we know about the normal human propensity for
violence, Smith&apos;s murderer, whoever he is, must be
insane; and suppose Ralph thinks that Smith&apos;s mur-
derer is Jane&apos;s uncle. Substituting &apos;Jane&apos;s uncle&apos;
for &amp;quot;Smith&apos;s murderer&apos; yields the wrong result: it is
not the case that in view of what we know about the
normal human propensity for violence, Jane&apos;s uncle,
whoever he is, must be insane. Since in general sub-
stitution is not allowed in intensional contexts, when
the description fails (i.e., no one murdered Smith),
Ralph&apos;s speech act must fail too. The fact that he
may know quite well who he thought the culprit was
does not matter.
By way of summary, here are the steps that a
hearer might go through in calculating the implica-
ture that is typically intended when a conversation-
ally relevant description is used:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978879166666667">
1. Recognising a conversationally relevant de-
scription
2. Identifying the universal generalisation
3. Postulating an intensional justification
4. Locating an appropriate set of propositions rel-
ative to which the modal operator is interpreted
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999688352941176">
Of course, this mechanism is much more flexible
than I make it out to be, and a speaker can use it
to satisfy various other goals. For example, a defi-
nite description can be used to provide information
[Appelt 19851, or to highlight shared knowledge, or
simply to avoid mechanical repetition of a proper
name. The following quotation illustrates how a
conversationally relevant description can achieve all
these goals simultaneously:
19 In the Democratic primaries, Mr. Jackson,
who is considered a long shot for the
Vice-Presidential nomination, received more
than seven million votes. The 46-year-old
Chicago clergyman has not said whether he
wants the second spot on the Democratic
ticket... (New York Times, June 28, 1988)
Since the name &apos;Jackson&apos; is already available as
the best functionally relevant referring expression,
it should be obvious to the reader that the descrip-
tion &apos;the 46-yew-old Chicago clergyman&apos; is con-
versationally relevant. But if the reader were to go
through the steps outlined above, he would reach a
dead end. There is nothing in view of which it must
be the case that any 46 year old Chicago clergyman
has not said whether he wants the second spot on
the democratic ticket. Thus, the implicature that
usually accompanies a conversationally relevant de-
scription is ruled out. Nor is there an obvious im-
plicit description that is used to convey a similar
implicature. The reader is then forced to search for
other explanations, and one obvious possibility is
that the author wants to inform the reader (or re-
mind him) that Jackson is a 46 year old clergyman
from Chicago.

4 Non- assertives
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97667464">
So far I have assumed that the conversationally rele-
vant description is used within the context of an as-
sertion, and I have relied, in my derivation of the im-
plicature, on the fact that in assertions the speaker
is expected to have adequate evidence for what he
says. In other speech acts, however, evidence and
justification play a completely different role, if any.
For example, a speaker who asks a question is not
expected to have &apos;evidence&apos; for it. Still, the use of
conversationally relevant descriptions is clearly not
restricted to assertions. Consider the following:
20 [After the verdict is pronounced, the Mayor
to the District Attorney)
Congratulations on nailing the most
fearsome criminal in recent history.
21 [While the serving plate is passed around, a
guest to the host)
I am not very hungry. Could I have the
smallest steak please?
22 [A young cop to his superior, as the chase
begins)
One thing I can promise you: I will not let
Smith&apos;s murderer get away!
A detailed description of how my account can be
extended to cover these cases would take us too far

afield. In general, however, the same analysis can
apply to non-assertions such as the above as well.
Coherence is no less important in discourse contain-
ing requests, warnings, promises, etc. than in one
containing assertives. The hearer must understand
the reasons why a congratulation, a request, or a
promise are being performed, and the role of conver-
sationally relevant descriptions in such speech acts
would be similar to their roles in assertives, with
similar implicatures. As rough approximations, the
implicatures involved in the three examples above
are expressed by the following statements, respec-
tively:
• In view of the danger that criminals pose to
society, nailing the most fearsome criminal in
recent history is an act that must be congratu-
lated.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.82172525">
• In view of my wish to stay both slim and polite,
I must have the smallest steak.
• In view of my moral convictions, I should try

5 Indefinite descriptions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997219433333334">
In this paper I take referring expressions to be uses
of noun phrases that are intended to indicate that a
particular object is being talked about. Hence, in-
definite descriptions can obviously serve as referring
expressions, and the distinction between functional
and conversational relevance should apply to them
as well. Usually, a use of an indefinite description as
a referring expression signals to the hearer that the
identity of the referent is not important (e.g., &apos;A
policeman gave me a speeding ticket&amp;quot;). Some uses
of indefinite descriptions, however, are clearly made
with the intention that the hearer identify whom
the speaker has in mind. For example,
23 A person I know did not take out the
garbage as he had promised...
Here, identification is obviously required, but it does
not matter at all how the referent is identified. The
indefinite description is, therefore, only functionally
relevant. In contrast, consider the following
24 A cardiovascuclar specialist told me that I
exercise too much.
Although the identity of the physician is not impor-
tant, the fact that he is a cardiovascular specialist
surely is. The indefinite description is, therefore,
conversationally relevant.
Deborah Dahl discusses interesting cases in which
an indefinite description is both specific (i.e., used
with the intention that the hearer know the identity
of the referent) and attributive (that is, conversa-
tionally relevant). Here is one of her examples:
25 Dr. Smith told me that exercise helps. Since
I heard it from a doctor, I&apos;m inclined to
believe it [Dahl 1984].
Clearly, an accurate interpretation of °a doctor&apos;
would connect the referent with Dr. Smith. At the
same time, the use of the indefinite description high-
lights a property of Smith which is conversationally
relevant. Note that the indefinite description is used
to implicate a universal generalisation, namely, that
in view of what doctors know, any doctor who gives
you an advice, should (other things being equal) be
listened to. This is very similar in structure to the
implicature that is typically associated with conver-
sationally relevant definite descriptions.
As is the case with definite descriptions, such uses
of indefinite descriptions can accomplish other pur-
poses besides (or instead of) implicating a universal
generalisation. For example,
26 In fact, the Dewey-Truman matchup
illustrates the point. Mr. Truman was
thought to be a weak leader who could not
carry out his strong predecessor&apos;s program.
His election prospects were bleak. The
pundits were against him and a highly
successful Northeastern Governor was
poised to sweep into the White House.
(New York Times, May 26, 1988)4
The calculation of the implicature conveyed by the
indefinite description is left as an exercise for the
reader.
