Knowledge-based parsers are now accu-
rate, fast and robust enough to be used to
obtain syntactic annotations for very large
corpora fully automatically. We argue that
such parsed corpora are an interesting new
resource for linguists. The argument is
illustrated by means of a number of re-
cent results which were established with
the help of parsed corpora.

<bodyText confidence="0.999939285714286">
Once upon a time, knowledge-based parsers were
slow, inaccurate and fragile. This is no longer
true. In the last decade, enormous improvements
have been achieved in this area. Parsers based on
constraint-based formalisms such as HPSG, LFG,
and CCG are now fast enough for many appli-
cations; they are robust; and they perform much
more accurately than previously by incorporat-
ing, typically, a statistical disambiguation compo-
nent. As a consequence, such parsers now obtain
competitive, if not superior, performance. Zae-
nen (2004), for instance, points out that the (LFG-
based) XLE parser is fast, has a statistical disam-
biguation component, and is robust, and thus al-
lows full parsing to be incorporated in many appli-
cations. Clark and Curran (2007) show that both
accurate and highly efficient parsing is possible
using a CCG.
As a consequence of this development, massive
amounts of parsed sentences now become avail-
able. Such large collections of syntactically an-
notated but not manually verified syntactic analy-
ses are a very useful resource for many purposes.
In this position paper we focus on one purpose:
linguistic analysis. Our claim is, that very large
parsed corpora are an important resource for lin-
guists. Such very large parsed corpora can be
used to search systematically for specific infre-
quent syntactic configurations of interest, and also
to obtain quantitative data about specific syntac-
tic configurations. Although parsed corpora obvi-
ously contain a certain amount of noise, for many
applications the abundant size of these corpora
compensates for this.
In this paper, we illustrate our position by a nu-
mer of recent linguistic studies in which very large
corpora of Dutch have been employed, which
were syntactically annotated by the freely avail-
able Alpino parser (Bouma et al., 2001; van No-
ord, 2006).
The Alpino system incorporates a linguistically
motivated, wide-coverage grammar for Dutch in
the tradition of HPSG. It consists of over 800
grammar rules and a large lexicon of over 300,000
lexemes (including very many person names, geo-
graphical names, and organization names) and var-
ious rules to recognize special constructs such as
named entities, temporal expressions, etc. Since
we use Alpino to parse large amounts of data, it
is crucial that the parser is capable to treat sen-
tences with unknown words. A large set of heuris-
tics have been implemented carefully to deal with
unknown words and word sequences.
Based on the categories assigned to words, and
the set of grammar rules compiled from the HPSG
grammar, a left-corner parser finds the set of all
parses, and stores this set compactly in a packed
parse forest. All parses are rooted by an instance
of the top category, which is a category that gen-
eralizes over all maximal projections (S, NP, VP,
ADVP, AP, PP and some others). If there is no
parse covering the complete input, the parser finds
all parses for each substring. In such cases, the
robustness component will then select the best se-
quence of non-overlapping parses (i.e., maximal
projections) from this set.
In order to select the best parse from the parse
forest, a best-first search algorithm is applied. The
algorithm consults a Maximum Entropy disam-
biguation model to judge the quality of (partial)

parses. The disambiguation model is trained on
the manually verified Alpino treebank (about 7100
sentences from newspaper texts).
Although Alpino is not a dependency grammar
in the traditional sense, dependency structures are
generated by the lexicon and grammar rules as
the value of a dedicated feature. The dependency
structures are based on CGN (Corpus Gesproken
Nederlands, Corpus of Spoken Dutch) (Hoekstra
et al., 2003), D-Coi and LASSY (van Noord et al.,
2006).
Dependency structures are stored in XML. Ad-
vantages of the use of XML include the avail-
ability of general purpose search and visualiza-
tion software. For instance, we exploit XPATH
(standard XML query language) to search in large
sets of dependency structures, and Xquery to ex-
tract information from such large sets of depen-
dency structures (Bouma and Kloosterman, 2002;
Bouma and Kloosterman, 2007).

2 Extraposition of comparative objects
out of topic
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999829409090909">
The first illustration of our thesis that parsed cor-
pora provide an interesting new resource for lin-
guists, constitutes more of an anecdote than a sys-
tematic study. We include the example, presented
earlier in van Noord (2009), because it is fairly
easy to explain, and because it was how we be-
came aware ourselves of the potential of parsed
corpora for the purpose of linguistics.
In van der Beek et al. (2002), the grammar un-
derlying the Alpino parser is presented in some de-
tail. As an example of how the various specific
rules of the grammar interact with the more gen-
eral principles, the analysis of comparatives and
the interaction with generic principles for (right-
ward) extraposition is illustrated. In short, com-
paratives such as comparative adjectives and the
adverb anders as in the following example (1)
license corresponding comparative phrases (such
as phrases headed by dan (than)) by means of a
feature which percolates according to the extrapo-
sition principle. The analysis is illustrated in fig-
ure 1.

An anonymous reviewer criticized the anal-
ysis, because the extraposition principle would
also allow the rightward extraction of comparative
phrases licensed by comparatives in topic position.
The extraposition principle would have to allow
for this in the light of examples such as
(2) De vraag is gerechtvaardigd waarom de
The question is justified why the
regering niets doet
government nothing does
The question is justified why the goverment
does not act
However, the reviewer claimed that comparative
phrases cannot be extraposed out of topic, as ex-
amples such as the following indicate:
gisteren
yesterday
The rate never was lower than yesterday
Since the Alpino grammar allows such cases, it
is possible to investigate if genuine examples of
this type occur in parsed corpora. In order to un-
derstand how we can specify a search query for
such cases, it is instructive to consider the de-
pendency structure assigned to such examples in
figure 2. As can be observed in the dependency
graph, the left-right order of nodes does not rep-
resent the left-right ordering in the sentence. The
word-order of words and phrases is indicated with
XML attributes begin and end (not shown in fig-
ure 2) which indicate for each node the begin and
end position in the sentence respectively.

out of topic. We can then inspect the resulting list
to check whether the examples are genuine.

&gt;
../node[@rel=&amp;quot;hd&amp;quot;]/@begin
]/@begin = @begin
]
The query can be read as: find root sentences
in which there is a daughter node, which itself has
a daughter node with relation label obcomp (the
label used for comparative complements). The
daughter node should begin at the same position
as the root sentence. Finally, the end position of
the obcomp node must be larger than the end po-
sition of the head of the root sentence (i.e. the finite
verb).
In addition to many mis-parsed sentences, we
found quite a few genuine cases. A mis-parse
can for instance occur if a sentence contains two
potential licensers for the comparative phrase, as
in the following example in which verder can be
wrongly analysed as a comparative adjective.
(4) Verder
Further

forehand
Furthermore, I want my backhand to become
as good as my forehand
More interestingly for the present discussion are
the examples which were parsed correctly. Not
only do we find such examples, but informants
agree that nothing is wrong with such cases. Some
examples are listed in figure 3. It is striking that
many examples involve the comparative adjectives
liever and eerder. Also, the list involves exam-
ples where adverbials such as zo, zozeer, zoveel are
related with an extraposed subordinate sentence
headed by dat which according to the annotation
guidelines are also treated as comparative comple-
ments.
The examples show that at least in some cases,
the possibility of extraposition of comparative
complements out of topic must be allowed; we hy-
pothesize that the acceptability of such cases is not
a binary decision, but rather a preference which
depends on the choice of comparative on the one
hand, and the heaviness of the comparative com-
plement on the other hand.
For the purpose of this paper, we hope to have
illustrated how parsed corpora can be helpful to
find new empirical evidence for fairly complicated
and suble linguistic issues. Note that for a con-
struction of this type, manually verified treebanks
are much too small. We estimated that it takes
about 5 million words to find a single, good, ex-
ample. It appears unrealistic to assume that tree-
banks of the required order of magnitude of tens
of millions of words will become available soon.

In each of the three cases, corpus data is used
to estimate the frequency of both syntactic con-
figurations. Two corpora were used: the manu-
ally verified syntactically annotated CGN corpus
(spoken language, approx. 1M words), and the the
automatically parsed TwNC corpus (Ordelman et
al., 2007) (the newspapers up to 2001, a parsed
corpus of 300 million words). For the first two
experiments, manual inspection revealed that the
parsed corpus material was of high enough quality
to be used directly. Furthermore, the relevant con-
structions are highly frequent, and thus even rela-
tively small corpora (such as the syntactically an-
ers, due to differences in linguistic complexity.
This hypothesis thus assumes that agrammatic pa-
tients have difficulty with constructions of higher
linguistic complexity. An alternative hypothesis
states, that agrammatic patients have more diffi-
culty with linguistic constructions of lower fre-
quency.
In order to compare the two hypotheses, Bas-
tiaanse et al. perform three corpus studies. In
three earlier experimental studies it was found that
agrammatic patients have more difficulty with (a)
finite verbs in verb-second position versus finite
verbs in verb-final position; (b) scrambled direct
objects versus non-scrambled direct objects; and
(c) transitive verbs used as unaccusative versus
transitive verbs used as transitive.
The three pairs of constructions are illustrated
as follows.

notated part of CGN) provide sufficient data. For
the third experiment (unaccusative versus transi-
tive usage of verbs), an additional layer of manual
verification was used, and furthermore, as the sub-
categorization frequencies of individual verbs are
estimated, the full TwNC was searched in order to
obtain reasonably reliable estimates.
The outcome of the three experiments was the
same in each case: frequency information cannot
explain the difficulty encountered by agrammatic
patients. Verb-second is more frequent than verb-
final word order for lexical verbs and transitive
lexical verbs (the verbs used in the experiments
were all transitive). Finite verbs occur slightly
more often in verb-second position than in verb-
final position, but the difference is quite small.
Scrambled word order is more frequent than the
basic word order. The difference between the two
corpora (CGN and TwNC) is quite small in both
cases. Figure 4 gives an overview of the number
of occurrences of the transitive and unaccusative
use of the verbs used in the experiments in the
full TwNC. The data suggest that the relative fre-
quency of unaccusative depends strongly on the
verb, but that it is not in general the case that the
unaccusative use is less frequent than the transitive
use.
The three ‘difficult’ constructions used in the
experiments with aphasia patients are by no means
infrequent in Dutch. The authors conclude that the
hypothesis that processing difficulties are corre-
lated with higher linguistic complexity cannot be
falsified by an appeal to frequency.
What is interesting for the purposes of the cur-
rent paper, is that parsed corpora are used to es-
timate frequencies of syntactic constructions, and
that these are used to support claims about the role
of linguistic complexity in processing difficulties
of aphasia patients. Also note that figure 4 shows
that even in a large (300M word) corpus, the num-
ber of occurrences of a specific verb used with a
specific valency frame can be quite small. Thus,
it is unlikely that reliable frequency estimates can
be obtained for these cases from manually verified
treebanks.
Roland et al. (2007) report on closely related
work for English. In particular, they give fre-
quency counts for a range of syntactic construc-
tions in English, and subcategorization frequen-
cies for specific verbs. They demonstrate that
these frequencies are highly dependent on corpus
and genre in a number of cases. They use their data
to verify claims in the psycholinguistic literature
about the processing of subject vs. object clefts,
relative clauses and sentential complements.

<bodyText confidence="0.99727225">
As a further example of the use of parsed corpora
to further linguistic insights, we consider a recent
study (Bouma and Spenader, 2009) of the distribu-
tion of weak and strong reflexive objects in Dutch.
If a verb is used reflexively in Dutch, two forms
of the reflexive pronoun are available. This is il-
lustrated for the third person form in the examples
below.

The choice between zich and zichzelf depends on
the verb. Generally three groups of verbs are
distinguished. Inherent reflexives are claimed to
never occur with a non-reflexive argument, and as
a reflexive argument are claimed to use zich exclu-
sively, (12). Non-reflexive verbs seldom, if ever
occur with a reflexive argument. If they do how-
ever, they can only take zichzelf as a reflexive ar-
gument (13). Accidental reflexives can be used
with both zich and zichzelf, (14). Accidental re-
flexive verbs vary widely as to the frequency with
which they occur with both arguments. Bouma
and Spenader (2009) set out to explain this dis-
tribution.
The influential theory of Reinhart and Reuland
(1993) explains the distribution as the surface real-
ization of two different ways of reflexive coding.

both zich and zichzelf is actually ambiguous be-
tween an inherent reflexive and an accidental re-
flexive (which always is realized with zichzelf).
An alternative approach is that of Haspelmath
(2004), Smits et al. (2007), and Hendriks et al.
(2008), who have claimed that the distribution of
weak vs. strong reflexive object pronouns corre-
lates with the proportion of events described by
the verb that are self-directed vs. other-directed.
In the course of this investigation, a first inter-
esting observation is, that many inherently reflex-
ive verbs, which are claimed not to occur with
zichzelf, actually often do combine with this pro-
noun. Here are a number of examples (simplified
for expository purposes):

With regards to the main hypothesis of their
study, (Bouma and Spenader, 2009) use linear re-
gression to determine the correlation between re-
flexive use of a (non-inherently reflexive) verb and
the relative preference for a weak or strong re-
flexive pronoun. Frequency counts are collected
from the parsed TwNC corpus (almost 500 mil-
lion words). They limit the analysis to verbs that
occur at least 10 times with a reflexive meaning
and at least 50 times in total, distinguishing uses
by subcategorization frames. The statistical analy-
sis shows a significant correlation, which accounts
for 30% of the variance of the ratio of nonreflexive
over reflexive uses.

Knowledge-based parsers are now accurate, fast
and robust enough to be used to obtain syntactic
annotations for very large corpora fully automati-
cally. We argued that such parsed corpora are an
interesting new resource for linguists. The argu-
ment is illustrated by means of a number of re-
cent results which were established with the help
of huge parsed corpora.
Huge parsed corpora are especially crucial (1)
to obtain evidence concerning infrequent syntac-
tic configurations, and (2) to obtain more reliable
quantitative data about particular syntactic config-
urations.

In particular, they give frequency counts for a range of syntactic constructions in English, and subcategorization frequencies for specific verbs. They demonstrate that these frequencies are highly dependent on corpus and genre in a number of cases. They use their data to verify claims in the psycholinguistic literature about the processing of subject vs. object clefts, relative clauses and sentential complements. 4 The distribution of zelf and zichzelf As a further example of the use of parsed corpora to further linguistic insights, we consider a recent study (Bouma and Spenader, 2009) of the distribution of weak and strong reflexive objects in Dutch. If a verb is used reflexively in Dutch, two forms of the reflexive pronoun are available. This is illustrated for the third person form in the examples below. (12) Brouwers schaamt zich/*zichzelf Brouwers shames self1/self2 schrijverschap. writing Brouwers is ashamed of his writing (13) Duitsland Germany als Europees kampioen. as European Champion Germany does not succeed itself as European champion (14) Wie zich/zichzelf niet juist Who self1/self2 not properly introduceert, introduces, Everyone who does not introduce himself </context>

Here are a number of examples (simplified for expository purposes): (15) Nederland moet stoppen zichzelf op de Netherlands must stop self2 on the borst chest The Netherlands must stop beating itself on the chest (16) Hunze Hunze kloppen knock Hunze doesn’t want to knock itself on the chest too much gegoochel met allerlei tactische varianten variants They sometimes lost themselves in tactical variants With regards to the main hypothesis of their study, (Bouma and Spenader, 2009) use linear regression to determine the correlation between reflexive use of a (non-inherently reflexive) verb and the relative preference for a weak or strong reflexive pronoun. Frequency counts are collected from the parsed TwNC corpus (almost 500 million words). They limit the analysis to verbs that occur at least 10 times with a reflexive meaning and at least 50 times in total, distinguishing uses by subcategorization frames. The statistical analysis shows a significant correlation, which accounts for 30% of the variance of the ratio of nonreflexive over reflexive uses. 5 Conclusion Knowle</context>

Parsers based on constraint-based formalisms such as HPSG, LFG, and CCG are now fast enough for many applications; they are robust; and they perform much more accurately than previously by incorporating, typically, a statistical disambiguation component. As a consequence, such parsers now obtain competitive, if not superior, performance. Zaenen (2004), for instance, points out that the (LFGbased) XLE parser is fast, has a statistical disambiguation component, and is robust, and thus allows full parsing to be incorporated in many applications. Clark and Curran (2007) show that both accurate and highly efficient parsing is possible using a CCG. As a consequence of this development, massive amounts of parsed sentences now become available. Such large collections of syntactically annotated but not manually verified syntactic analyses are a very useful resource for many purposes. In this position paper we focus on one purpose: linguistic analysis. Our claim is, that very large parsed corpora are an important resource for linguists. Such very large parsed corpora can be used to search systematically for specific infrequent syntactic configurations of interest,</context>

Inherent reflexives are claimed to never occur with a non-reflexive argument, and as a reflexive argument are claimed to use zich exclusively, (12). Non-reflexive verbs seldom, if ever occur with a reflexive argument. If they do however, they can only take zichzelf as a reflexive argument (13). Accidental reflexives can be used with both zich and zichzelf, (14). Accidental reflexive verbs vary widely as to the frequency with which they occur with both arguments. Bouma and Spenader (2009) set out to explain this distribution. The influential theory of Reinhart and Reuland (1993) explains the distribution as the surface realization of two different ways of reflexive coding. An accidental reflexive that can be realized with zijn his voor for volgt *zich/zichzelf niet op follows self1/self2 not PART af. out valt is 37 verb luiden to ring/sound scheuren to rip breken to break verbrand to burn oplossen to (dis)solve draaien to turn smelten to melt rollen to roll verdrinken to drown stuiteren to bounce unacc trans # % # % 269 26.6 743 73.4 332 28.8 819 71.2 1969 31.2 4341 68.8 479 43.5 623 56.5 296 59.2 204 40.8 2709 59.4 1852 40.6 723 71.4 290 28.6 3500 93.5 244 6.5 1397 </context>

What is interesting for the purposes of the current paper, is that parsed corpora are used to estimate frequencies of syntactic constructions, and that these are used to support claims about the role of linguistic complexity in processing difficulties of aphasia patients. Also note that figure 4 shows that even in a large (300M word) corpus, the number of occurrences of a specific verb used with a specific valency frame can be quite small. Thus, it is unlikely that reliable frequency estimates can be obtained for these cases from manually verified treebanks. Roland et al. (2007) report on closely related work for English. In particular, they give frequency counts for a range of syntactic constructions in English, and subcategorization frequencies for specific verbs.

This is no longer true. In the last decade, enormous improvements have been achieved in this area. Parsers based on constraint-based formalisms such as HPSG, LFG, and CCG are now fast enough for many applications; they are robust; and they perform much more accurately than previously by incorporating, typically, a statistical disambiguation component. As a consequence, such parsers now obtain competitive, if not superior, performance. Zaenen (2004), for instance, points out that the (LFGbased) XLE parser is fast, has a statistical disambiguation component, and is robust, and thus allows full parsing to be incorporated in many applications. Clark and Curran (2007) show that both accurate and highly efficient parsing is possible using a CCG. As a consequence of this development, massive amounts of parsed sentences now become available. Such large collections of syntactically annotated but not manually verified syntactic analyses are a very useful resource for many purposes. In this position paper we focus on one purpose: linguistic analys</context>
