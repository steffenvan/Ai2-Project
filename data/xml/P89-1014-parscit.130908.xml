1.0 INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.999945584905661">
It is well known that NLP systems,
in order to be robust, must handle ill-
formed input. One common type of error
involves the use of non-standard
prepositions to mark arguments. In this
paper, we argue that such errors can be
handled in a systematic fashion, and that a
system designed to handle them offers
other advantages.
The examples of non-standard
prepositions we present in the paper are
taken from colloquial language, both
written and oral. The type of error these
examples represent is quite frequent in
colloquial written language. The frequency
of such examples rises sharply in evolving
sub-languages and in oral colloquial
language. In developing an NLP system to
be used by various U.S. government
customers, we have been sensitized to the
need to handle variation and innovation in
preposition usage. Handling this type of
variation or innovation is part of our
overall capability to handle novel
predicates, which are frequent in sub-
language. Novel predicates created for sub-
languages are less &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot; in how they mark
arguments (ARGUMENT MAPPING) than
general English &amp;quot;core predicates which
speakers learn as children. It can be
expected that the eventual advent of
successful speech understanding systems
will further emphasize the need to handle
this and other variation.
The NLP system under development
at SRA incorporates a Natural Language
Knowledge Base (NLKB), a major part of
which consists of objects representing
SEMANTIC PREDICATE CLASSES. The
system uses hierarchical knowledge sources;
all general &amp;quot;class-level&amp;quot; characteristics of a
semantic predicate class, including the
number, type, and marking of their
arguments, are put in the NLKB. This
leads to increased efficiency in a number
of system aspects, e.g., the lexicon is more
compact and easier to modify since it only
contains idiosyncratic information. This
representation allows us to distinguish
between lexically and semantically
determined ARGUMENT MAPPING and to
formulate general class-level constraint
relaxation mechanisms.

Preposition usage in English in

syntactically determined, or (3)

1.3 COMPUTATIONAL APPLICATIONS
OF THIS WORK
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998797059405941">
In a theoretical linguistics forum
(Blejer and Flank 1988), we argued that
these examples of the use of non-standard
prepositions to mark arguments (1)
represent the kind of principled variation
that underlies language change, and (2)
support a semantic analysis of government
that utilizes thematic roles, citing other
evidence for the semantic basis of
prepositional case marking from studies of
language dysfunction (Aitchison 1987:103),
language acquisition (Pinker 1982:678;
Menyuk 1969:56), and typological, cross-
linguistic studies on case-marking systems.
More theoretical aspects of our work
(including diachronic change and
arguments for and against particular
linguistic theories) were covered in that
paper; here we concentrate on issues of
interest to a computational linguistics
forum. First, our natural language
knowledge representation and processing
strategies take into account the semantic
basis of prepositional case marking, and
thus facilitate handling non-standard and
novel use of prepositions to mark
arguments. The second contribution is our
typology of errors in preposition usage. We
claim that an NLP system which accepts
naturally occurring input must recognize
the type of the error to know how to
compensate for it. Furthermore, the
knowledge representation scheme we have
implemented is an efficient representation
for English and lends itself to adaptation to
representing non-English case-marking as
well.
There is wide variation in
computational strategies for mapping from
the actual natural language expression to
some sort of PREDICATE-ARGUMENT
representation. At issue is how the system
recognizes the arguments of the predicate.
At one end of the spectrum is an approach
which allows any marking of arguments if
the type of the argument is correct for that
predicate. This approach is inadequate
because it ignores vital information carried
by the preposition. At the other extreme is
a semantically constrained syntactic parse,
in many ways a highly desirable strategy.
This latter method, however, constrains
more strictly than what humans actually
produce and understand. Our strategy has
been to use the latter method, allowing
relaxation of those constraints, under
certain well-specified circumstances.
Constraint relaxation has been
recognized as a viable strategy for
handling ill-formed input. Most discussion
centers around orthographic errors and
errors in subject-verb agreement. Jensen,
Heidorn, Miller, and Ravin (1983:158) note
the importance of &amp;quot;relaxing restrictions in
the grammar rules in some principled way.&amp;quot;
Knowing which constraints to relax and
avoiding a proliferation of incorrect parses
however, is a non-trivial task. Weischedel
and Sondheimer .(1983:163ff) offer
cautionary advice on this subject.
There has been some discussion of
errors similar to those cited in our paper.
Carbonell and Hayes (1983:132) observed
that &amp;quot;problems created by the absence of
expected case markers can be overcome by
the application of domain knowledge&amp;quot; using
case frame instantiation. We agree with
these authors that the use of domain
knowledge is an important element in
understanding ill-formed input. However,
in instances where the preposition is not
omitted, but rather replaced by a non-
standard preposition, we claim that an
understanding of the linguistic principles
involved in the substitution is necessary.
To explain how constraint
relaxation is accomplished, a brief system
description is needed. Our system uses a
parser based on Tomita (1986), with
modifications to allow constraints and
structure-building. It uses context-free
phrase structure rules, augmented with
morphological, contextual, and semantic
constraints. Application of the phrase
structure rules results in a parse tree,
similar to a Lexical-Functional Grammar
(LFG) &amp;quot;c-structure&amp;quot; (Bresnan 1982). The
constraints are unified at parse time to
produce a functionally labelled template
(FLT). The FLT is then input to a semantic
translation module. Using ARGUMENT
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.462152">
1 1 1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994728">
MAPPING rules and other operator-
operand semantic rules, semantic
translation creates situation frames (SF).
SFs consist of a predicate and entity frames
(EF), whose semantic roles in the situation
are labeled. Other semantic objects are
relational frames (e.g. prepositional
phrases), property frames (e.g. adjective
phrases), and unit frames (measure phrases).
During the semantic interpretation and
discourse analysis phase, the situation
frame is interpreted, resulting in one or
more instantiated knowledge base (KB)
objects, which are state or event
descriptions with entity participants.

2.0 REPRESENTING ARGUMENT
MAPPING IN AN NLP SYSTEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791075471698">
In our lexicons, verbs and adjectives
are linked to one or more predicate classes
which are defined in the Natural Language
Knowledge Base (NLKB). Predicates
typically govern one or more arguments or
thematic roles. All general, class-level
information about the thematic roles which
a given predicate governs is represented at
the highest possible level. Only
idiosyncratic information is represented in
the lexicon. When lexicons are loaded the
idiosyncratic information in the lexicon is
unified with the general information in the
NLKB. Our representation scheme has
certain implementational advantages:
lexicons are less error-prone and easier to
modify, the data are more compact,
constraint relaxation is facilitated, etc.
More importantly, we claim that such
semantic classes are psychologically valid.
Our representation scheme is based
on the principle that ARGUMENT
MAPPING is generally determined at the
class-level, i.e., predicates group along
semantic lines as to the type of
ARGUMENT MAPPING they take. Our
work draws from theoretical linguistic
studies of thematic relations (e.g., Gruber
1976, Jackendoff 1983, and Ostler 1980).
We do not accept the &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; version of
localism, i.e., that all form mirrors function
-- that ARGUMENT MAPPING classes
arise from metaphors based on spatial
relations. Unlike case grammar, we limit
the number of cases or roles to a small set,
based on how they are manifested in
surface syntax. We subsequently &amp;quot;interpret&amp;quot;
roles based on the semantic class of the
predicate, e.g., the GOAL of an ATTITUDE
is generally an animate &amp;quot;experiencer&amp;quot;.
For example, in the NLKB the
ARGUMENT MAPPING of predicates
which denote a change in spatial relation
specifies a GOAL argument, marked with
prepositions which posit a GOAL relation
(to, into, and onto) and a SOURCE
argument, marked with prepositions which
posit a SOURCE relation (from, out of, off
of). A sub-class of these predicates, namely
Vendler&apos;s (1967) achievements, mark the
GOAL argument with prepositions which
posit an OVERLAP relation (at, in).
Compare:

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945909090909">
The entries for these verbs in SRA&apos;s lexicon
merely specify which semantic class they
belong to (e.g., SPATIAL-RELATION),
whether they are stative or dynamic,
whether they allow an agent, and whether
they denote an achievement. Their
ARGUMENT MAPPING is not entered
explicitly in the lexicon. The verb reach,
on the other hand, which marks its GOAL
idiosyncratically, as a direct object, would
have this fact in its lexical entry.

2.1 GROUPING SEMANTIC ROLES
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984792">
Both on implementational and on
theoretical grounds, we have grouped
certain semantic roles into superclasses.
Such groupings are common in the
literature on case and valency (see Somers
1987) and are also supported by cross-
linguistic evidence. Our grouping of roles
follows previous work. For example, the
AGENT SUPERCLASS covers both animate
agents as well as inanimate instruments. A
GROUND SUPERCLASS (as discussed in
Talmy 1985) includes both SOURCE and
GOAL, and a GOAL SUPERCLASS
includes GOAL, PURPOSE, and
DIRECTION.
Certain semantic roles, like GOAL
and SOURCE, as well as being sisters are
&amp;quot;privatives&amp;quot;, that is, opposites semantically.
Our representation scheme
differentiates between lexically and
semantically determined prepositions. We
will show how this representation
facilitates recognition of the type of error,
and therefore principled relaxation of the
constraints. Furthermore, a principled
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.766237">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99952875">
relaxation of the constraints depends in
many instances on knowing the relationship
between the non-standard and the expected
prepositions: are they sisters, privatives, or
is the non-standard preposition a parent of
the expected preposition.
In the following section we present
examples of the five types of preposition
usage errors. In the subsequent section, we
discuss how our system presently handles
these errors, or how it might eventually
handle them.

<bodyText confidence="0.997747045454546">
The substitution of the goal marker
for the source marker cross-linguistically is
recognized in the case literature (e.g.,
Ikegami 1987). In English, this appears to
be more pronounced in certain regional
dialects. Common source/goal alternations
cited by Ikegami (1987:125) include: averse
from/to, different from/to, immune
from/to, and distinction from/to. The
majority of examples involve to
substituting for from in lexical items which
incorporate a negation of the predicate; the
standard marker of GROUND in this class
of predicates is a SOURCE marker, e.g.,
different from. The &amp;quot;positive&amp;quot; counterparts
mark the GROUND with GOAL, e.g.,
similar to, as discussed in detail in Gruber
(1976). Variation between to and from can
only occur with verbs which incorporate a
negative, otherwise the semantic distinction
which these prepositions denote is
necessary.

Communication and transfer of
knowledge can be expressed either as a
process with multiple, equally involved

with one of the participants as the &amp;quot;agent&amp;quot;
of the transfer of information. Our data
document the substitution of the GOAL
marker for the CO-THEME marker; this
may reflect the tendency of English to
prefer &amp;quot;agent&amp;quot; focussing. The participants
in a COMMUNICATION situation are
similar in their semantic roles, the only
difference being one of &amp;quot;viewpoint.&amp;quot; By no
means all communication predicates operate
in this way: e.g., EXPLANATION,

clearly asymmetric. The system

semantic role GOAL, another preposition
within the same superclass is chosen. In
example (5) the phrasally determined for is
replaced by the GOAL marker. There is
abundant cross-linguistic evidence for a
GOAL SUPERCLASS which includes
GOAL and PURPOSE; to a lesser extent
DIRECTION also patterns with these cross-
linguistically.

among the more salient associations that

WITH/BY
In the majority of the following
examples, the syntactically governed by
marking passives is replaced by WITH.
This alternation of with and by in passives
has been attested for hundreds of years,
and we hypothesize that English may be in
the process of reinterpreting by, as well as
replacing it with with in certain contexts.
On the one hand, by is being reinterpreted
as a marker of &amp;quot;archetypal&amp;quot; agents, i.e, those
high on the scale of AGENTIVITY (i.e.,

handling the semantic for semantic and

Semantic for semantic substitutions

(e.g., in the GOAL SUPERCLASS),
(iv) the non-standard preposition is the
NLKB-inherited, &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; preposition for
the predicate (e.g., REFERENT for
predicates of cognition and knowledge), or
(v) in the NLKB the predicate allows a
SECONDARY-MAPPING of PLURAL-
THEME (e.g., marital predicates as in the
divorce with example).
Handling the use of a non-standard
preposition marking an argument crucially
involves &amp;quot;type-checking&amp;quot;, wherein the &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;
of the noun phrase is checked, e.g. for
membership in an NLKB class such as
animate-creature, time, etc. Type-checking
is also used to narrow the possible senses of
the preposition in a prepositional phrase,
as well as to prefer certain modifier
attachments.
Prepositional phrases can have two
relations to predicating expressions, i.e., a
governed argument (PREP-ARG) or an
ADJUNCT. During parsing, the system
accesses the ARGUMENT MAPPING for
the predicate; once the preposition is
recognized as the standard marker of an
argument, an ADJUNCT reading is
disallowed. The rule for PREP-ARG is a
separate rule in the grammar. When the
preposition does not match the expected
preposition, the system checks whether any
of the above conditions (i-v) hold; if so, the
parse is accepted, but is assigned a lower
likelihood. If a parse of the PP as an
ADJUNCT is also accepted, it will be
preferred over the ill-formed PREP-ARG.

The substitution of semantic
marking for syntactic (WITH for BY) is
easily handled: during semantic mapping
by phrases in the ADJUNCTS are mapped
to the role of the active subject, assuming
that &amp;quot;type checking&amp;quot; allows that
interpretation of the noun phrase. It is also
possible for such a sentence to be
ambiguous, e.g., &amp;quot;he was seated by the
man&amp;quot;. We treat with phrases similarly,
except that ambiguity between CO-THEME
and PASSIVE SUBJECT is not allowed,
based on our observation that with for by
is used for noun phrases low on the
animacy scale. Thus, only the CO-THEME
interpretation is valid if the noun phrase is
animate.

False starts are more difficult,

type of the argument marked with the
&amp;quot;incorrect&amp;quot; preposition must be quite
inconsistent with that sense of the
predicate for the error even to be noticed,
since the preposition is acceptable with
some other sense. We are assessing the
frequency of false starts in the various
genres in which our system is being used,
to determine whether we need to implement
a strategy to handle these examples. We
predict that future systems for
understanding spoken language will need to
accomodate this phenomenon.
We do not handle blends currently.
They involve a form of analogy, i.e.,
smitten is like mad, syntactically,
semantically, and even stylistically; they
may shed some light on language storage
and retrieval. Recognizing the similarity in
order to allow a principled handling seems
very difficult.
In addition, blends may provide
evidence for a &amp;quot;top down&amp;quot; language
production strategy, in which the argument
structure is determined before the lexical
items are chosen/inserted. Our data
suggest that some people may be more
prone to making this type of error than are
others. Finally, blends are more frequent
in genres in which people attempt to use a
style that they do not command (e.g.,
student papers, radio talk shows).
5.0 DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK
In this paper we have described a
frequent type of ill-formed input which
NLP systems must handle, involving the use
of non-standard prepositions to mark
arguments. We presented a classification of
these errors and described our algorithm
for handling some of these error types. The
importance of handling such non-standard
input will increase as speech recognition
becomes more reliable, because spoken
input is less formal.
In the near term, planned
enhancements include adjusting the
weighting scheme to more accurately
reflect the empirical data. A frequency-
based model of preposition usage, based on
a much larger and broader sampling of text
will improve system handling of those
errors.

<abstract confidence="0.999502928571428">NLP systems, in order to be robust, must handle novel and ill-formed input. One common type of error involves the use of non-standard prepositions to mark arguments. In this paper, we argue that such errors can be handled in a systematic fashion, and that a system designed to handle them offers other advantages. We offer a classification scheme for preposition usage errors. Further, we show how the knowledge representation employed in the SRA NLP system facilitates handling these data.</abstract>

The standard preposition in these examples is lexically determined. In example (6), instead of the lexically determined to, which also marks the semantic role GOAL, another preposition within the same superclass is chosen. In example (5) the phrasally determined for is replaced by the GOAL marker. There is abundant cross-linguistic evidence for a GOAL SUPERCLASS which includes GOAL and PURPOSE; to a lesser extent DIRECTION also patterns with these crosslinguistically.

In English, this appears to be more pronounced in certain regional dialects. Common source/goal alternations cited by Ikegami (1987:125) include: averse from/to, different from/to, immune from/to, and distinction from/to. The majority of examples involve to substituting for from in lexical items which incorporate a negation of the predicate; the standard marker of GROUND in this class of predicates is a SOURCE marker, e.g., different from. The &amp;quot;positive&amp;quot; counterparts mark the GROUND with GOAL, e.g., similar to, as discussed in detail in Gruber (1976). Variation between to and from can only occur with verbs which incorporate a negative, otherwise the semantic distinction which these prepositions denote is necessary.
