ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986153846154">
We propose a distinction between two kinds of
metonymy: &amp;quot;referential&amp;quot; metonymy, in which the refer-
ent of an NP is shifted, and &amp;quot;predicative&amp;quot; metonymy, in
which the referent of the NP is unchanged and the ar-
gument place of the predicate is shifted instead. Exam-
ples are, respectively, &amp;quot;The hamburger is waiting for his
check&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Which airlines fly from Boston to Denver&amp;quot;.
We also show that complications arise for both types of
metonymy when multiple coercing predicates are con-
sidered. Finally, we present implemented algorithms
handling these complexities that generate both types of
metonymic reading, as well as criteria for choosing one
type of metonymic reading over another.

1 INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998275571428571">
The phenomenon of semantic coercion, or &amp;quot;metonymy&amp;quot;,
is quite a common one in natural language. In
metonymy, the actual argument of a predicate is not
the literal argument, but is instead implicit and related
to the literal argument through an implicit binary rela-
tion. For example, in the following utterances, taken
from Lakoff and Johnson (1980):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995405">
(1) The ham sandwich is waiting for his check
(2) Nixon bombed Hanoi
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99957048">
it is not literally the ham sandwich which is doing the
waiting, but rather the person who ordered it, and not
literally Nixon who is doing the bombing, but rather the
pilots under his command. The noun phrase - &amp;quot;The ham
sandwich&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Nixon&amp;quot; - is said to be &amp;quot;coerced&amp;quot; through
an implicit binary relation to a related object which is
the actual argument of the predicate.
Perhaps the most familar definition of metonymy
from the literature is that it is a figure of speech in
which the speaker is &amp;quot;using one entity to refer to an-
other that is related to it&amp;quot; (Lakoff and Johnson,1980).
This definition is quite commonly held in one form
or another. (For example, see (Fass,1991), where it
is directly quoted; also similar definitions in (Puste-
jovsky,1991), (Hobbs,1988)). But what does it really
mean? Does it mean that the coerced noun phrase is
actually an indirect reference to an object different from
its literal referent?
If so, then we might expect other linguistic data to
support this. For example, we might expect subsequent
anaphora to agree with the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; referent. And indeed,
in the following dialogue the intra-sentential pronoun
&amp;quot;his&amp;quot; and the extra-sentential &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; both agree with the
indirect reference to the customer, not the the literal
sandwich:

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.979351529411765">

(4&apos;) Nixon bombed Hanoi
*They sang all the way back to Saigon
The dialogue (4) is quite natural, while in (4&apos;), the use
of &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; to refer to the bomber crews seems ruled out
- the reverse of what the indirect reference view would
predict.
A second problem with the indirect reference view
is found in certain performative contexts, such as wh-
questions and imperatives, in which the referent of a
particular NP is sought by the speaker. If this NP
is metonymically coerced, we could expect the cor-
rect response to the utterance to be the indirect refer-
ence. Consider, the following examples, which are ac-
tual utterances collected for the DARPA ATIS domain
(MADCOW,1992), a database question-answering do-
main about commercial air flights:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9909265">
(5) Which wide-body jets serve dinner?
(6) Which airlines fly from Boston to Denver?
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.998718">
87
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999559913793104">
In ATIS, only flights &amp;quot;fly&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;serve meals&amp;quot; and thus
both sentences can only be understood metonymically.
In (5), it is not the jets which serve dinner but the
flights on the jets, and one plausible constnial is indeed
that &amp;quot;wide-body jets&amp;quot; is really a reference to flights on
wide-body jets, and the interpretation of the sentence is
a request to display the set of these flights. This would
agree with the indirect reference view.
In (6), however, the only possible construal seems
to be that a set of airlines - the airlines offering flights
from boston to Denver - is being sought. To respond
to this request with the set of flights from Boston to
Denver would clearly be absurd.
We propose a distinction, motivated by such exam-
ples, between two kinds of metonymy, which we term
referential and predicative. In referential metonymy,
the metonymic noun phrase does indeed have an in-
tended referent related to but different from its literal
meaning. An example is the noun phrase &amp;quot;the ham
sandwich&amp;quot; in (1) above, where the actual and intended
referent is to a related object - the person who ordered
the sandwhich. In predicative metonymy, however, the
actual and intended referent of the noun phrase is just
the literal one, and it is more accurate to say that the
predicate is coerced (though as we show later, this
is itself a simplification). An example of predicative
metonymy is (6) above.
We also show how both types of metonymy are
complicated by the presence of multiple predicates that
require the same coercion of an NP. We present al-
gorithms for generating the two types of metonymic
reading that cope with these complexities. Finally, we
present criteria for determining a preference for one
type of metonymic reading over another. (We do not,
however, deal in this paper with the question of how to
determine which relations to use for coercion, viewing
this as a separate problem.)
The examples throughout are taken from the ATIS
domain, a domain with a pre-established formal concep-
tual system of categories and relations that utterances
must be mapped onto. The algorithms presented are im-
plemented in the DELPHI system (Bobrow et a1,1991),
which has been ported to that domain and formally eval-
uated in it.
The remainder of the paper is organized into the
following sections:
Section 2, the next section, formalizes the distinc-
tion between referential and predicative metonymy by
giving logical form readings for each, and shows how
both types of metonymy are globally complicated when
multiple coercing predicates are considered.
Section 3 gives an algorithm for generating both
types of metonymic readings in semantic interpretation
that handles these global complications.
Section 4 gives criteria for picking one type of read-
ing over another
Finally, section 5 compares our work to previous
work on metonymy.

2 METONYMY AND LOGICAL FORM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997828666666667">
In this section we sharpen and formalize our notion of
referential and predicative metonymy by giving logical
form readings for the different cases.
The logical language we use has sortal quantifiers,
with a special quantifier &amp;quot;WH&amp;quot;. A wh question is the
treated as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.557579">
(7) (wh x S (and (P1 x) (P2 x)))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.905700888888889">
which is interpreted as a request to display all members
of S (the semantic class of the wh-np) which satisfy both
PI (the modifiers of the wh-np) and P2 (the predicate
of the clause). A labeled-argument notation is used for
clause semantics.
Now, let us return to the examples of the previous
section. In (5), the referential metonymic reading of the
sentence in which flights are sought that serve dinner
and are on wide-body jets is expressed as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.738775">
(8) Which wide-body jets serve dinner?
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.912017">
(wh x ffights
(and (exists y jets
(and (aircraft-of x y)
(wide-body y)))
(serve flight-of x
meal-of dinner)))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99889">
where coercion relation is AIRCRAFT-OF, mapping
between flights and the aircraft they are on.
Compare this with the reading for (6), in which
airlines and not flights are sought:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.843616">
(9) Which airlines fly from Boston to Denver?
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.641224333333333">

<bodyText confidence="0.99885994117647">
The readings of the referential (8) and and the predica-
tive (9) are in a sense inside-out versions of each other.
Both have an interpolated quantifier for FLIGHTS that
is not explicitly present in the utterance but in (8) the
interpolated is on the outside and is the WH-thing dis-
played whereas in (9) the interpolated quantifier is on
the inside, and is merely part of the description of what
is to be displayed. This, in logical terms, is the crux of
the referential/predicative distinction.
Predicative metonymy can be loosely thought of as
coercion of a predicate argument place, rather than of
the argument NP itself. It may therefore seem attractive
to try to formalize this in a directly compositional way
through some device such as lambda-abstraction. If P
is the predicate, R the binary relation of coercion, and
i the argument-number of P to be coerced, the coerced
version of P might then be defined in such a view as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.956645333333333">
(lambda
(exists y (domain R)
(and (R y (P
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998581222222222">
This is a predicate just like P, except extended by the
relation R in its i&apos;th argument place to take an object in
the range of R. Metonymic extension of the predicate
would be then be an essentially compositional, local
process, taking place at the juncture of predicate and
argument and not affecting interpretation elsewhere.
Unfortunately, such a treatment turns out to give the
wrong interpretation when multiple predicates requiring
the same coercion are present. Consider:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98429325">
(10a) Which airlines flying from Boston to Denver
leave at 3 pm?
(10b) Show airlines flying from Boston to Denver
leaving at 3 pm
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9972109">
Both examples are predicative metonymic utterances.
Airlines neither &amp;quot;fly&amp;quot; nor &amp;quot;leave&amp;quot;; flights do these, so
both the main verb and the relative clause modifier pred-
icates require airline-to-flight coercions. If the lambda-
abstraction scheme is right each predicate-application
could be dealt with separately.
Yet the following reading for 10a, which would
result from the application of the lambda-abstraction
scheme to the two predicates, is emphatically not the
correct reading:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9633403">
(11) (wh x airlines
(and (exists y flights
(airline-of y x)
(fly flight-of y
orig-of Boston
dest-of Denver))
(exists y&apos; flights
(airline-of y&apos; x)
(leave flight-of y&apos;
time-of (3 pm)))))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988625">
These truth-conditions are too weak, as they allow air-
lines that have a Boston to Denver flight at any time,
so long as they have another (possibly different) flight
at 3 pm to any place. The proper reading is instead:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.4752315">
(12) (wh x airlines
(exists y flights
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.985494806451613">
(and (airline-of y x)
(fly flight-of y
orig-of Boston
dest-of Denver)
(leave flight-of y
time-of (3 pm)))))
in which the airline is related to a single flight descrip-
tion that has all the desired properties.
Note that the issue here is not that one predicate
is internal to the NP and the other external to it. The
same problem arises with whatever combination of in-
ternal and external predicates. In 10b, for example,
both predicates are internal to the NP but if the two
coercions are carried out seperately the same erroneous
truth-conditions will result, in which the AIRLINE is
related to two different FLIGHT descriptions instead of
one.
Nor is the &amp;quot;single-interpolation&amp;quot; requirement re-
lated specifically to the referential/predicative distinc-
tion. If we modify one of our referential examples to
include multiple coercing predicates, as below:
The ham sandwich at table 12 is impatient
we see that a correct reading would still require that the
ham sandwich be related to one and only one interpo-
lated description of a person that ordered the sandwich,
is seated at table 12, and is impatient.
That fact that multiple coercions of the same NP,
whether internal or external to it, cannot be carried out
separately means that the phenomenon of metonymy
takes on a decisively global character, one which is as
much akin to quantifier scoping as it is to compositional

semantic interpretation. As we shall see in the next
section, the quantifier scoping stage of processing is
exactly where we locate the solution to these problems.

3 GENERATING THE READINGS
</sectionHeader>

We now show how referential and predicative
metonymic readings are generated, and how the require-
ment of a single interpolate for multiple coercions is
enforced.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993907">
3.1 Input Representation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994825">
A two-stage mechanism of semantic interpretation is
used in the DELPHI system. In the first stage, an ini-
tial predicate-argument level of semantic representation
is produced, with quantifiers in place. In the second,
a fully quantified logical form is generated, in which
quantifiers are pulled out of the predicate-argument rep-
resentation and placed in their proper relative scope. It
is in this second stage that the referential/predicative
distinction is made.
The first stage of semantic interpretation has been
described elsewhere in (Bobrow et a1,1991), and we do
not discuss it here except to describe its output, which
forms the input to the quantification stage. This output
is a tree of whose nodes are phrasal representation ob-
jects. Each of these phrasal representation objects has a
head and a set of bindings. The head includes semantic
type information (as well as other information such as
subcategorization etc.), while the bindings represent the
semantic effects of modifiers on the head. Each binding
has four parts:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9997945">
1. the modifier grammatical relation
2. the modifier semantic relation
3. the filler of this semantic relation
4. a binary coercion relation
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991003780487805">
The following is the top-level phrasal representation
for &amp;quot;Which airlines fly from Boston to Denver?&amp;quot;:
CLAUSE:
head: fly
subject: flight-of, (wh airlines), airline-of
pp: orig-of, Boston, identity
pp: dest-of, Denver, identity
This representation has three bindings: a SUBJECT
and two PP-complements. In the two PP bindings, the
ranges of the modifier semantic relations ORIG-OF and
and DEST-OF are both CITY, which agrees with the
explict fillers BOSTON and DENVER. Thus, in these
bindings no coercion is needed and the coercion relation
is just IDENTITY. But in the SUBJECT binding, the
range of the modifier relation FLIGHT-OF is FLIGHT
and the explicit filler is an AIRLINE. Here, the coer-
cion relation AIRLINE-OF is required to bridge the gap
between FLIGHT and AIRLINE.
NP semantic representations have the same struc-
ture, plus a quantifier. Here is the representation for
&amp;quot;which airline&amp;quot;
NP:
head: AIRLINE
quant: wh
We refer to the constituent modifier bindings of the NP
itself as its &amp;quot;internal&amp;quot; bindings. In this particular exam-
ple, there are no internal modifiers and thus no internal
bindings. When an NP is a constituent of a clause (or
is the object of a PP which is), we call the binding in
which the NP occurs its &amp;quot;external&amp;quot; binding.
Semantic representations of this kind are neutral not
only with respect to quantifier scoping, but to the dis-
tinction between predicative and referential metonymy
as well. From the standpoint of the predicate, one can
think of the coercion relation as extending the given
argument place of the predicate to take an argument of
a different type. From the standpoint of the NP argu-
ment, on the other hand, the coercion can be viewed as
mapping the NP in the &amp;quot;reverse&amp;quot; direction of the rela-
tion, from range AIRLINE to domain FLIGHT instead
of from domain to range.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997288">
3.2 Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999531428571429">
The alternative metonymic readings are generated from
these semantic representations as part of the quantifier
scoping pass. There are two steps.
Step 1, carried out before quantification begins, is
to walk the phrasal representation tree and build a &amp;quot;co-
ercion table&amp;quot; relating each nominal head N to the set of
coercion relations on it:
— the coercion relation of N&apos;s external binding
Ri — the coercion relations of N&apos;s internal bindings
As a technical convenience, IDENTITY relations in the
Re,Ri are subscripted with the semantic type restric-
tion T of the binding in which they occur. This type
restriction is simply the range of the semantic modifier
relation in the binding.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995563">
90
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999330227272727">
Step 2 is to pull the quantifiers out of this struc-
ture and into their proper places in a complete formula.
For an NP with a non-IDENTITY entry in the coercion
relation, alternative WFF-generating schemas are used
to generate the alternative referential and predicative
metonymic readings.
In what follows, let N be the noun phrase under
consideration and let Q be its quantifier and S its sort.
Let R be any relation which is not IDENTITY and
which is one of the coercion relations associated with
N in the table - whether Re or one of the R.
Now, consider all the internal bindings of N which
have R as their coercion relation. Let the MR and FR
be respectively the semantic modifier relations and cor-
responding arguments of these bindings. Let the Mo,
F0 and Ro be, respectively, the semantic modifier re-
lations, arguments and coercion relations of bindings
which do not have R as their coercion relation.
The operation of reading generation is to pick a
non-IDENTITY R from N&apos;s table, and apply the two
schemas. To generate the predicative reading, the fol-
lowing schema is used:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.991491833333333">
(Q x S
{(Mo x Fo
(exists y (domain R)
(and (R y x)
{(MR Y FR)})
.**))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.988522">
The token &amp;quot;&amp;quot;*&amp;quot; indicates the open slot for the matrix
predicate of the clause, and the brackets &amp;quot;{&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;}&amp;quot; are
shorthand for conjoined iteration over the subscripted
items within.
Note that the interpolated EXISTS quantifer has
scope over the matrix formula of the clause, so it will
govern any external R coercion for N. Furthermore, be-
cause all the R coercions are gathered together in this
scheme, the same quantifier will govern any R coer-
dons which are internal to the NP. This fufills the re-
quirement of the previous section: that there be one and
only one quantifier for a given coercion, even when that
coercion is needed both by internal modifier relations
and by the external clause in which the noun phrase is
contained.
Use of the schema for our example above generates
the interpretation:
Which airlines fly from Boston to Denver?
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.961925833333333">
(wh x AIRLINE
(exists y FLIGHT
(AIRLINE-OF y x)
(FLY flight-of y
orig-of Boston
dest-of Denver)))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999792545454545">
as desired.
In order to enforce the restriction that subsequent
anaphora resolve to the literal AIRLINE and not the in-
terpolated FLIGHT (and, similarly, to &amp;quot;Nixon&amp;quot; instead
of the pilots in our earlier example) we add a diacritic
to the interpolated quantifier `(exists y FLIGHT ...)&apos;
that forbids the discourse component from resolving an
anaphor to this quantified description.
The referential metonymic reading is generated by
a different schema. In order to use this schema, the
following condition must hold:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.821783">
(Re = R) V (Re = I DENT ITYT A (domainR) C T)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999744090909091">
This condition ensures that a semantically ill-formed
expression will not result and simply requires that the
type requirement of the external binding of the NP to
be referentially coerced agrees with the coerced ver-
sion. Either the coercion must be dictated by the ex-
ternal binding itself, or the external binding&apos;s type re-
quirement must be loose enough to accept the coerced
version (as in the case of a loosely-typed predicate like
&amp;quot;show&amp;quot;).
If these conditions hold, then the following schema
can be used to produce the referential reading:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.858804615384615">
(Q x (domain R)
(and (exists y S (and {(MR y FR)} (R x )7))
{(Mo x Fo))))
***)
Use of the schema generates the following reading for
our example:
Which wide-body jets serve dinner?
(wh x FLIGHT
(exists y JET
(and (WIDE-BODY y)
(AIRCRAFT-OF x y)
(SERVE flight-of x
meal-of DINNER))))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99472325">
In principle, of course, a given NP&apos;s entry in the
coercion table can have more than one distinct non-
IDENTITY coercion relation. Obviously in such a case
there can be at most one referential coercion of the NP.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997316">
91
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878">
All other coercions to different semantics types must
then be predicative. In the case of multiple predicative
coercions, the predicative schema is simply iterated.
We arbitrarily disallow chains of coercions (&amp;quot;double-
shifting&amp;quot;), though these in principle could be accomo-
dated.

4 DETERMINING THE CORRECT
READING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997008605263158">
Thus far we have argued for different types of
metonymic reading and shown how to generate them,
but have not given any indication of when a given type
of reading is to be preferred. How do we know, for
example, that the predicative reading and not the refer-
ential is correct in (6) &amp;quot;Which airlines fly from Boston
to Denver&amp;quot;?
A few criteria are fairly obvious. One we have
already seen in the previous section: the external-
binding agreement condition on applying the referen-
tial metonymy schema. If an NP&apos;s external semantic
context agrees with its literal referent, but not its refer-
entially coerced version, then referential metonymy is
ruled out for that NP.
A somewhat broader notion of external semantic
context is found in intra-sentential anaphora:
The ham sandwich is waiting for HIS check
Which airline flies to ITS headquarters city?
Clearly, we would prefer any intra-sentential anaphora
to agree with the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; referent of the NP. In the first
sentence above, the pronoun &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; cannot agree with the
literal referent, but can agree with the metonymically
interpolated PERSON, and so provides evidence for the
referential reading. In the second sentence, the pronoun
&amp;quot;its&amp;quot; cannot agree in number with the interpolated set
of FLIGHT, but can agree with the singular &amp;quot;airline&amp;quot;,
and so provides evidence for the predicative reading.
Neither of these two criteria addresses example (6),
however. Our hypothesis is that the real distinction be-
ing made here is pragmatic. An important principle of
language use (essentially part of the Gricean Maxim
of Quantity (Grice,1975)) is that a cooperative speaker
will avoid adding a part of a description which self-
evidently adds no constraint to the set of things being
described. This is the reason why such pleonasms as
&amp;quot;female woman&amp;quot; sound odd to us, and are not normally
uttered. In this light, the referential reading of the sen-
tence above:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.790728833333333">
(wh x FLIGHT
(exists y AIRLINE
(AIRLINE-OF x y))
(FLY flight-of x
orig-of Boston
dest-of Denver))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.969162615384615">
has a completely redundant component, since every
flight is on some airline. Yet this redundant component
is precisely the one introduced to handle the coercion!
Encoding the reference in this way has no utility: one
might as well have said &amp;quot;which flights&amp;quot; to begin with.
We can formalize this principle as follows. Let
R be the coercion relation and let S be the literal NP
referent-set. Then the referential coercion of the NP
can be written as the pairing (R,S), which describes a
property on the domain of R that picks out just the
subset of the domain of R that is obtained by mapping
S back into the domain in the &amp;quot;reverse&amp;quot; direction of R.
Such a property is considered vacuous if it provides no
constraint on the domain, or in other words if:
R is a total relation and S = (RANGE R)
holds. A total, or &amp;quot;into&amp;quot;, relation is one which maps
every element of its domain to at least one element of
its range. Since every flight in AT1S is on an airline,
AIRLINE-OF is a total relation, and AIRLINE is its
range, so a referential metonymy is clearly vacuous in
this case.
In contrast, the relation AIRCRAFT-OF is total,
but &amp;quot;wide-body jet&amp;quot; is a proper subclass of its range
(AIRCRAFT), so this condition does not hold for &amp;quot;What
wide body jets serve dinner?&amp;quot; and referential metonymy
is allowed for it.
Similar pragmatic considerations can be applied
to rule out predicative metonymy in some cases. If
a metonymically extended predicate provides no con-
straint on the NP, then predicative metonymy is the
less likely reading. Consider again our referential ex-
ample, &amp;quot;What wide-body jets serve dinner&amp;quot;. If this is
taken predicatively, it would have as its logical form:
(wh x jet
(and (wide-body x)
(exists y flight
(and (aircraft y x)
(serve flight-of y
meal-of dinner)))))

The class AIRCRAFT in ATIS is really the set of
aircraft-types, and the same aircraft-type is typically
used by a large number of flights with nothing par-
ticularly in common. It therefore seems unlikely that
the property &amp;quot;(used on flights)that serve dinner&amp;quot; offers
any constraint on the class AIRCRAFT: in other words,
that being a particular type of aircraft and being used
by a flight that serves dinner are correlated in any way.
This particular judgment, however, is based on human
knowledge and plausibility, and is difficult to formalize
given the current state of the art in knowledge repre-
sentation.
We have proposed a number of possible theoreti-
cal criteria for choosing between predicative and refer-
ential metonymy. It is of some interest, therefore, to
compare the relative occurences of predicative and ref-
erential metonymy in actual data. Our study of a large
(&gt; 5000 sentence) corpus of naturally collected ATIS
data shows that predicative metonymy is very common.
Noun phrases headed by &amp;quot;fare&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;airline&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ticket&amp;quot;
frequently appear in positions that require a flight argu-
ment. Yet it is clear, both from the meaning of the utter-
ance, and from the judgements of independent annota-
tors who pair these sentences with &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; responses
for NL system evaluation, that fares and airlines are
being talked about in such cases, and not flights.
Indeed, our experiments have shown that allow-
ing predicative metonymic coercion when evaluating
DELPHI against this corpus leads to a 27% decrease in
weighted error over not allowing it. This is very sub-
stantial difference indeed, and testifies to the importance
of the metonymy phenomenon in actual data.
As for the referential type of metonymy, we have
found only a few cases of it in this corpus. We hy-
pothesize that the reason for this is that referential
metonymy, involving as it does an encoding of a ref-
erence in terms of a categorially different thing, is a
more marked and unusual event in psychological terms.
Predicative metonymy, on the other hand, involves no
such operation, merely the convenient making-way of a
predicate for a non-standard but related argument. For
this reason, our work prefers predicative metonymy as
the default choice in processing when no other evidence
is present.

We have argued for a distinction between two types
of metonymic reading, and have given evidence that
metonymy must ultimately be treated as a global phe-
nomenon over the sentence, part of which belongs
with quantificational considerations and part with lo-
cal compositional interpretation. We have shown how
pragmatic considerations of language use can influence
which reading is preferred.
The referential/predicative distinction is not ob-
served in most of the writing on metonymy, which is
either not formal and computational in nature (Lakoff
and Johnson,1980), or is oriented towards different
types of systems and computational concerns. Hobbs
(1987,1988), for instance, discusses metonymy along
with a number of other &amp;quot;local pragmatic&amp;quot; issues (nom-
inal compounds, etc.), but this work is done in the
context of a message-processing and not a question-
anweting system, so many of the issues we have dis-
cussed (wh-questions, etc.) simply do not arise there.
Something like the referential/predicative distinc-
tion does seem to be present, however, in the work of a
few other authors. For example, Fass (1991) speaks of
what he calls the &amp;quot;source&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;target&amp;quot; of a metonymy
being alternatively substituted for. His sentence repre-
sentations are not done in a formal logical framework,
however, so it is difficult to tell if the ambiguity has a
referential or truth-conditional consequence.
Closer to our work is that of Pustejovsky (1991).
He defines a notion he calls &amp;quot;logical metonymy&amp;quot;
which seems quite close to our notion of predicative
metonymy. In a sentence like &amp;quot;Mary enjoyed the book&amp;quot;,
logical metonymy changes the type of the verb &amp;quot;en-
joy&amp;quot; to take an object like &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; which is not an
event but which is related to one (the reading of the
book). As we have shown in Section 3, however, the
single-interpolation requirement for multiple coercing
predicates poses a technical problem for a verb type-
changing view which only looks at the given verb and
argument by themselves. Our work has demonstrated
that a correct account of metonymic coercion must, in
the most general case, involve considerations that are
global over the whole utterance interpretation.
Our work has also demonstrated an important inter-
action between appropriateness of metonymic readings
and the Gricean Maxim of Quantity. To our knowl-
edge, no other work has done this. Finally, our work
differs from previous work in the area by having been
carried out in an environment of objective evaluation,
an environment whose rigors have pushed us towards
many of the insights presented here.

Examples are, respectively, &amp;quot;The hamburger is waiting for his check&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Which airlines fly from Boston to Denver&amp;quot;. We also show that complications arise for both types of metonymy when multiple coercing predicates are considered.

Finally, we present implemented algorithms handling these complexities that generate both types of metonymic reading, as well as criteria for choosing one type of metonymic reading over another. 1 INTRODUCTION The phenomenon of semantic coercion, or &amp;quot;metonymy&amp;quot;, is quite a common one in natural language. In metonymy, the actual argument of a predicate is not the literal argument, but is instead implicit and related to the literal argument through an implicit binary relation. For example, in the following utterances, taken from Lakoff and Johnson (1980): (1) The ham sandwich is waiting for his check (2) Nixon bombed Hanoi it is not literally the ham sandwich which is doing the waiting, but rather the person who ordered it, and not literally Nixon who is doing the bombing, but rather the pilots under his command. The noun phrase - &amp;quot;The ham sandwich&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Nixon&amp;quot; - is said to be &amp;quot;coerced&amp;quot; through an implicit binary relation to a related object which is the actual argument of the predicate. Perhaps the most familar definition of metonymy from the literature is that it is a figure of speech in which the speaker is &amp;quot;using one entity to refer to anoth</context>
