<bodyText confidence="0.999547444444445">
In this paper, we present a comment labeling
system based on a deep learning strategy. We
treat the answer selection task as a sequence
labeling problem and propose recurrent
convolution neural networks to recognize
good comments. In the recurrent architecture
of our system, our approach uses
2-dimensional convolutional neural networks
to learn the distributed representation for
question-comment pair, and assigns the labels
to the comment sequence with a recurrent
neural network over CNN. Compared with
the conditional random fields based method,
our approach performs better performance on
Macro-F1 (53.82%), and achieves the highest
accuracy (73.18%), F1-value (79.76%) on
predicting the Good class in this answer
selection challenge.

The community question answering site or system
(CQA) is one kind of common platforms where
people can freely ask questions, deliver comments
and participate in discussions. The high-quality
comments given a question are the important
resources to generate useful question-answer pairs,
which are of great value for knowledge base
construction and information retrieval (IR).
However, due to the unrestricted expressions in
CQA, it still one problem to recognize the
high-quality comments from the open domain data,
which are involve in a large of noise information.
Nevertheless, the semantic relevance between
question and comment makes sense to predict the
quality of comment by modeling the semantic
matching for question-comment pair.
Prior work on predicting the class of comment
(or answer) mainly attempted to measure the
semantic similarity between question and
comment with typical classification approaches,
such as LR and SVM. To achieve the semantic
relevance matching for question-comment pair, a
large number of works focus on constructing
feature-engineering to extract the features of
question and comment as the input of models.
Beyond typical textual feature, some works
integrate the structural information (Wang et al.,
2009; Huang et al., 2007) into the discrete
representations of question-comment pairs to
improve the performances of comment classifiers.
Another option is extracting user metadata (Chen
and Nayak, 2008; Shah and Pomerantz, 2010)
from the question answering portal for enriching
the feature-engineering. Empirically the
approaches above have been shown to improve
performances on recognizing positive answers, but
they rely on large numbers of hand-crafted
features, and require various external resources
which may be difficult to obtain. Furthermore,
they suffer from the limitation of requiring
task-specific feature extraction for new domain.
Recently the works about neural network-based
distributed sentence models (Socher et al., 2012;
Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) have achieved
successes in natural language processing (NLP).
As a consequence of this success, it appears
natural to attempt to solve question answering
using similar techniques. To recognize the
high-quality answers, Hu et al. (2013) learned the
joint representation for each question-answer pair

by taking both of the textual and non-textual
features as the input of multi-DBN model. To
achieve the answer sentence selection, Yu et al.
(2014) proposed convolution neural networks
based models to represent the question and answer
sentences. For the semantic matching between
question and answer, the methods based on deep
learning generally exploit to learn the distributed
representation of question-answer pair as the input.
Instead of extracting a variety of features, these
approaches learn the semantic features to
represent question and answer. However, these
approaches only focus on modeling the semantic
relevance between question and answer, ignoring
the semantic correlations in answer sequence.
In this work, we present a novel comment
labeling system based on deep learning. We
propose the recurrent convolutional neural
networks (R&amp;CNN) approach to assign the labels
to comments given a question. Based on the
distributed representations learned form
2-dimensional CNN (2D-CNN) matching, our
approach achieves to comment sequence learning
and predict the classes of comments. Using the
word embedding trained by provided Qatar Living
data, R&amp;CNN not only models the semantic
relevance for question and comment, but also
captures the correlative context in comment
sequence for predicting the class of comment. The
experimental results show that our system
performs better performances than the CRF based
method (Ding et al., 2008) on recognizing good
comments, and performs more adaptive on the
development and test dataset.

The architecture of our comment labeling system
is a recurrent architecture (shown in Figure 1)
with a recurrent neural network over the
convolutional neural networks. Given a question,
our approach achieves to learn the semantic
relevance between question and comment by
2D-CNN matching and generate the distributed
representation of each question-comment pair.
After that, our approach uses the RNN to model
the semantic correlations in comment sequence,
and makes the quality predictions for the comment

2.1 Convolutional Neural Networks for
question-comment matching
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999782714285714">
Convolutional neural networks are a natural
extension of neural networks for treating image.
Hu et al. (2014) proposed the 2D-CNN model to
do semantic matching between two sentences. In
our work, we use 2D-CNN to learn the distributed
representations for question-comment pairs.
Unlike 1D-CNN, executing the interaction
between question and answer in final multi-layer
perception (MLP) with their individual
representations, 2D-CNN maps question and
comment into a common space for learning the
representation of question-comment pair and
captures the rich matching patterns between
question and answer by layer-by-layer convolution
and pooling.
The first layer is 1D-convolution layer, whose
role is converting word embedding of question
and comment into one common space with the
sliding window, whose size k is (3 × 3). For the
word i on question 𝑞 and word j on comment 𝑐,
1D-convolution can formulated as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.92689025">

𝑧̂𝑖,𝑗

</listItem>
<page confidence="0.987263">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999817166666667">
The 1D-convolution converts the concatenated
matrix H0 of question and comment into the
real-value matrix H1 . After that, 2D-CNN
executes deep 2D-convolution and pooling,
similar to that of traditional image input. The
output of the m`h hidden layer is computed as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996717">
Hm = u(p𝑜𝑜I(wmHm−1 + bm)) (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999149666666666">
Here, wm is the parameter matrix for the feature
maps on m`h hidden layer and bm is the bias
vector. u(. ) is the sigmoid activation function.
The final distributed representation p𝑡 of
question-comment pair learned from 2D-CNN
represents the semantic relevance between
question and comment, and provides the reliable
evidences to make a quality prediction for the
corresponding comment.

2.2 Recurrent Neural Network for comment

<bodyText confidence="0.999973636363637">
Recurrent neural network is a straightforward
adaptation of the standard feed-forward neural
network (Bengio et al., 2012) to allow it to model
sequential data. The recurrent neural network in
our work has one input layer X, one hidden layer
H for updating the hidden state, and the output
layer Y. For the time step t, the input to RNN
includes the learned representation p(t) and the
previous hidden state ℎ(t − 1) . The output is
denoted as 𝑦(t). The output of input, hidden and
output layers are computed as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999962333333333">
x(t) = w𝑖p(t) + wℎℎ(t − 1) + bℎ
ℎ(t) = u(x(t))
𝑦(t) = g(w𝑦ℎ(t) + b𝑦)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9933036">
where w𝑖 is the matrix of connection between
CNN and the input layer of RNN; wℎ plays role
in updating network state or context; and w𝑦 is
the matrix of connection between hidden layer
and output layer. Both of bℎ and b𝑦 are bias
vectors. Here, u(. ) is the sigmoid activation
function; g (. ) is the softmax function. x (t) is
the joint representation of current pair and
context. Our approach is able to capture the
context by updating the hidden state ℎ(t).
To train the networks proposed here, we use the
backpropagation through time with stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. At each
training step, error vector is computed according
to cross entropy criterion, weights are updated as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999445">
Err𝑜r (t; 0) = R(t) − 𝑦(t) (6)

R (t) is the true class; and 0 includes all the
parameters of CNN and RNN.

Compared to CRF and CRF+V, our approach
outperforms them in evolution metrics. There are
several reasons for the unsatisfying performances
of CRF and CRF+V. First, it is sparse to extract
semantic features of question-comment pairs from
short contents in baselines. In contrast, the
distributed representation learned from our model
is able to capture semantic relationship between
words of question-comment pairs based on deep
convolution and pooling. Secondly, there are large
amount of noise information involved in CQA,
such as various emotional symbols and the
abbreviated words. The feature-engineering of
CRF based method generally suffers from the
quality of dataset. Besides of that, the divergences
of class distribution between the development and
test influence the effectiveness directly. Hence,
our approach performs more powerful and
adaptive to different dataset or new domain. We
also can demonstrate this point by comparing the
experimental results of CRF and CRF+V on the
test (shown in Table 4). By integrating the
distributed representation from our R&amp;CNN,
CRF+V improves 9% on Macro-F1, 7.74% on
accuracy over CRF, and 4.53% in F1-value of
predicting Good class.
Taking only word embedding as the original
features, our approach has achieved 53.82% in
Macro-F1. In contrast, the supervised feature-rich
(SFR) approach performs 57.29% in Macro-F1 by
integrating multi-type features, such as word
embedding, features from topic models and user
metadata etc. The main reason for that is the low
performance of our approach on predicting the
answers of Potential class, which has a major
import on Macro-F1 due to the effect of
marcoaveraging. There are several factors for that
result. The first is the imbalance distribution in
training data, which is lacking of the train samples
of Potential class. So the distributed models based
purely on word embedding are not very well
equipped to learn the meaningful representations
for question and potential comments. Secondly,
Potential class is an intermediate category
(Màrquez et al., 2015) that was quite hard to
human annotators. Hence, surface-form matching
between the words of question-comment pair is
hard to identify its correct class merely using word
embedding.
In addition, when considering the heavy
reliance of feature-engineer of SFR in comparison
to the simplicity of our approach, the Macro-F1
our approach obtained is highly encouraging.
What’s more, our model achieves the
start-of-the-art in accuracy and F1-value of Good
class. These promising results indicate the
effectiveness of our approach in predicting the
high-quality comments in CQA.

In this paper, we present a comment labeling
system based on the deep learning architecture.
Without the complicated feature-engineering and
external semantic resources, the recurrent
convolutional neural networks (R&amp;CNN)
approach proposed by us not only is able to
capture semantic matching patterns between
question and comments, but also learn the
meaningful context in the comment sequence. In
this answer selection task, our approach achieves
the state-of-the-art on recognizing good comments,
and performs better accuracy than baselines while
obtains powerful results in Macro-F1.
In the future, we would like to investigate the
methods of training the imbalance data (e.g. the
Potential class) to improve the performances of
our approach, such as the typical oversampling
and undersampling methods.

There are several factors for that result. The first is the imbalance distribution in training data, which is lacking of the train samples of Potential class. So the distributed models based purely on word embedding are not very well equipped to learn the meaningful representations for question and potential comments. Secondly, Potential class is an intermediate category (Màrquez et al., 2015) that was quite hard to human annotators. Hence, surface-form matching between the words of question-comment pair is hard to identify its correct class merely using word embedding. In addition, when considering the heavy reliance of feature-engineer of SFR in comparison to the simplicity of our approach, the Macro-F1 our approach obtained is highly encouraging. What’s more, our model achieves the start-of-the-art in accuracy and F1-value of Good class. These promising results indicate the effectiveness of our approach in predicting the high-quality comments in CQA. 4 Conclusion In this paper, </context>

Using the word embedding trained by provided Qatar Living data, R&amp;CNN not only models the semantic relevance for question and comment, but also captures the correlative context in comment sequence for predicting the class of comment. The experimental results show that our system performs better performances than the CRF based method (Ding et al., 2008) on recognizing good comments, and performs more adaptive on the development and test dataset. 2 System Description The architecture of our comment labeling system is a recurrent architecture (shown in Figure 1) with a recurrent neural network over the convolutional neural networks.
