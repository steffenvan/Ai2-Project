This article describes the construction
of a morphological, syntactic and semantic
analyzer to operate a high-grade search
engine for Hebrew texts. A good search
engine must be complete and accurate. In
Hebrew or Arabic script most of the
vowels are not written, many particles are
attached to the word without space, a
double consonant is written with one
letter, and some letters signify both vowels
and consonants. Thus, almost every string
of characters may designate many words
(the average in Hebrew is almost three
words). As a consequence, deciphering a
word necessitates reading the whole
sentence. Our model is Fillmore’s
framework of an expression with a verb as
its center. The engine eliminates readings
of words unsuited to the syntax or the
semantic structure of the sentence. In
every verbal entry of our conceptual
dictionary the features of the noun phrases
(NP’s) required by the verb are included.
When all the correct readings of all the
strings of characters in the sentence have
been identified, the program chooses the
proper occurrences of the searched word
in the text. Approximately 95% of the
results by our search engine match those
in the query.
1.Introduction
It is easy to construct a search engine that,
in a given text, will find all the
occurrences of the string of characters
specified in the query. In Hebrew script,
however, the string of characters that
makes up a word may also be interpreted
as designating other words. Almost every
word in Hebrew script can be read as one
of an average of three words. This is
because Hebrew script is fundamentally
defective: (1) Most vowels in a given
word have no sign in the script. (2)
Particles are attached with no intervening
space to the string of characters that makes
up the following word. (3) A geminated
consonant is written as one letter, like a
not-geminated consonant. (4) Several
letters serve as both vowels and
consonants. Threfore, it is impossible to
identify the word stated in the query by its
form: if we try to do so, we would obtain
all the occurrences which are written in
the same way but are, in fact, different
words. Since only 20-30% of the words so
obtained are actually occurrences of the
required word, the users have to check
every word in the result obtained in order
to decide whether it is actually the one
they want.1 In order to solve this problem,
some systems recommend that every
query should contain some other words
that are often found close to the stipulated
word.2 But such a search may lead to a
loss of important occurrences of the
required word. Neither a frequency list of
words nor another statistical device can be
an ultimate answer in our search of
accurate and full device. A statistical
approach ensures that some mistakes or

omissions will always exist. Also,
eliminating certain readings by an
examination of the words in the short
context will not ensure completeness, nor
will it ensure accuracy, since a large
number of the strings that appear in the
result will not be relevant to the question.
(Choueka and Lusignan, 1985; Choueka,
1990). We can obtain a correct reading of
a word only if we can make a correct
reading of the whole sentence. In order to
do this, we must eliminate all the
unsuitable readings of every string of
characters in the sentence, and leave only
one reading. To this end, we had to go
through the following stages:
1. First, we adopted a phonemic script, a
method of writing Hebrew in Latin
characters, in which each vowel has its
character, the particles are separated
from the following word, geminated
consonants are represented by two
identical letters, and vowels and
consonants are given completely
distinct letters .3

2. Now we are able to carry out a
morphological analysis revealing all
the word’s components. By examining
the results, the correct reading could
be clearly seen. This would be

impossible in Hebrew script. We
constructed a complete, exact
morphological analyzer for Hebrew
words, which also identifies inflections
and attached particles.

<listItem confidence="0.9479925">
3. Having perfected the
morphological analyzer, which

provides a complete set of details
for the analysis of any possible
reading of a string of characters,
we could write a program
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.994505615384615">
3 The phonemic script contains four diacritics:
××, ¬, ¡, Ð, also À (or `) and ¿ (or ‘). See ISO-
259-3 (available in http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/
~ornan/ papers). Several programs for analysis of
Hebrew morphology use the regular Hebrew
script also for the output. See Bentor et al 1992,
Segal, 1999, Carmel and Maarek, 1999 (a
statistical filter based on Bentor et al). The
problem is that in this way one can show the
diverse readings only with the traditional
Hebrew dots and points, many of them
superfluous. Our method is clearer since we use
Latin characters through the whole work.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.871908896551724">
which checks every suggested reading
of a word, and eliminates readings
unsuitable to the syntax of the possibly
required sentence.
4. Even a syntactic reading does not
ensure that each of the strings in
the sentence is indeed a proper
reading of the relevant word.
Syntactic elimination may leave
many words that do not suit a
meaningful sentence. Further
semantic eliminating is required.
5. For this purpose we compiled a
complete conceptual dictionary of the
Hebrew language. It is based on
Fillmore’s ideas about case grammar
(Fillmore, 1968), according to which
the verb is the center of the expression:
it is a function whose arguments are
the noun phrases. In every conceptual
entry in our dictionary of verbs there
appear the semantic, syntactic and
morphological features demanded by
the verb to exist in the NP’s of the
sentence, -- including the prepositions,
which precede them. Since the
dictionary includes also the features of
the arguments (NP’s) in the sentence, it
eliminates readings of words that are
suitable syntactically but not
semantically. Semantic check enables
us to discriminate both between
different readings of same string of
Hebrew characters as well as between
the different meanings of each of the
readings.
In this way we completed the
necessary basis for the production of an
excellent search engine: it will respond
to any question only with the
occurrences which bear the stipulated
meaning, even though the same reading
of the characters may have several
meanings. The contents of the article
are as follows:
In section 2 we shall explain how we
establish all possible readings of a string
of characters. Section 3 shows how we use
syntactic features to eliminate readings
that do not fit the syntactic context; then
we describe our conceptual dictionary.
Section 4 shows how we can eliminate
readings that are possible syntactically but
not semantically. Finally, in section 5 we
shall explain how we choose the
appropriate meaning of the word by using
the dictionary. Section 6 concludes the
article.

2. The morphological stage
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974903935483871">
Our algorithm consists of three stages:
morphological, syntactic and semantic.
Here we shall describe the first stage, the
morphological. The strings of characters
are taken from the Hebrew text in Hebrew
script, and every string is analyzed. As
was mentioned above, Hebrew script
containsonly some of the vowels4 attaches
particles to the following word, and does
not use double characters to specify
geminated letters (see Ornan, 1991); also,
some of the characters serve either as
vowels or as consonants. It is advisable to
be able to read the text in a script that does
not have these disadvantages51. We use the
phonemic script of ISO (FDIS 259-3).
Thus, for instance, the Hebrew word
HRKBT can be read in any of the
following ways:
hirkabta, hirkabt, harkabat
ha-rakkebt, h-rakabt, h-rakabta
In the morphological stage, each of these
possibilities is written at the beginning of
a separate line, followed by all the
grammatical details of the reading:
hrkbt V hirkib ,-,-,ta ,p,2,+,#,s -,-,-,-,-
hrkbt V hirkib ,-,-,t ,p,2,#,+,s -,-,-,-,-
hrkbt N harkaba ,c,-,t ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,-
hrkbt N rakkebt ,a,-,- ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,- ha-
hrkbt V rakab ,-,-,t ,p,-,#,+,s -,-,-,-,- h-
hrkbt V rakab ,-,-,ta ,p,-,+,#,s -,-,-,-,- h-

4 Ide and Vėronis (1998:2) mention this as a
cause of the need to “disambiguate” Semitic
languages. I would have been more correct for
them to refer in their article to the system of
writing rather then the languages.

The given Hebrew word is the first
column. The second column is the
category. The third column is the lexical
entry. The following column gives the
status of the word (construct, inflected or
absolute). Next come the prefix and suffix
of the word, the tense (for a verb), person,
gender (masc., fem. or both) and number
(s or p), and then details about person,
gender and number of the attached
pronoun (see the last example lq×nwh),
and the attached pronoun itself. The last
column specifies attached particles.
This morphological analysis is based
on a program which uses a complete
lexicon6, based on a comprehensive
grammar of all possible Hebrew word-
patterns – including, of course, all
inflections, regular and irregular.

3. The syntactic stage
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998755">
Each of these lines presents one possible
reading of the given word. But usually
only one reading is acceptable in any given
sentence. Therefore, we must eliminate
those readings, which are morphologically
correct, but incorrect in the given context.7
The first elimination is syntactic, and it is
done in the realm of one “Syntactic Unit”,
i.e., a clause which includes one verb and
is bounded by a “sign of separation”,
mainly subordinating or certain
coordinating particles.8 At this stage all
possible analyses of the strings of
characters are displayed. Now, the program
attempts to combine each line of every
word with every one of the lines of all
other words. The correctness of the
combination is checked with all possible

sequences of other words. Practically, only
a small number of these combinations
make a sentence that is syntactically
correct.9 How is the syntactic test
performed?
The program computes every
combination of possible strings of words.
For example, giving the sentence HBWQR
ZRªH £M£ ªMH (in Hebrew script – &amp;quot;hot
sun rose this morning&amp;quot;) will render the
following analysis of all readings of the
words of this sentence:
hbwqr N boqr ,a,-,- ,-,3,+,#,s -,-,-,-,- ha-
hbwqr N boqer ,a,-,- ,-,3,+,#,s -,-,-,-,- ha-
zrxh N zarxa ,a,-,- ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,-
zrxh N zerx ,i,-,- ,-,3,+,#,s 3,#,+,s,h
zrxh V zarax ,-,-,h ,p,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,-
jmj N jammaj ,a,-,- ,-,3,+,#,s -,-,-,-,-
jmj N jammaj ,c,-,- ,-,3,+,#,s -,-,-,-,-
jmj N jemj ,a,-,- ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,-
jmj N jemj ,c,-,- ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,-
jmj A jammaj ,a,-,- ,-,-,+,#,s -,-,-,-,-
jmj V jimmej ,-,-,- ,i,2,+,#,s -,-,-,-,-
jmj V maj ,-,-,- ,p,3,+,#,s -,-,-,-,- je-
jmj V maj ,-,-,- ,r,-,+,#,s -,-,-,-,- je-
xmh N xema ,a,-,- ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,-
xmh A xamma ,a,-,- ,-,-,#,+,s -,-,-,-,-
xmh N xamma ,a,-,- ,-,-,#,+,s -,-,-,-,-
This short expression provides 144
sentences to be checked: 2x3x8x3=144.
The syntactic stage will eliminate the great
majority of invalid sequences of possible
readings. We shall not discuss them all
here – only make some remarks about a
few clear cases for elimination. For
example, the readings boqr, boqer cannot
function syntactically as the subject of the
sentence, since they are masculine, and no
verb in the rest of the sentence which is
not preceded by subordinating je- (“that”)
is masculine (agreement is needed).
Similarly, the second word cannot be
zarxa: a feminine noun, and no verb agrees
with zarxa (as subject) in the analyses of
the other words.
9 There has been much research on syntactic
analysis by means of a computer program; for
instance, Wintner and Ornan, 1995. Herz and
Rimon, 1992, also deal mainly with syntactic
problems. Levinger et al., 1995 demonstrate
methods of eliminating syntactically incorrect
morphological readings. See, too, Levinger,
1992.
First, the program looks for a verb.
When a verb is identified, the program
checks possible nouns that can be the
syntactic subject. It then checks other NP’s
and PP’s, possible adjectives and adverbs.
Mainly because the order of words in
Hebrew is rather free, the syntactic stage
usually leaves a few possible sentences
that may be accepted as proper readings of
the input sentence from the syntactic point
of view. But some of these possibly
correct syntactic readings may possess
improper semantic!! features, which
should not be accepted.
We have a special treatment for
sentences without a verb (this may occur
in Hebrew and other languages, especially
Semitic): if the program does not identify
a verb in the input sentence, it adds the
verb haya (“to be”) in the appropriate
gender, number and person, and the review
process is repeated. Our dictionary of
verbs is described below. Here we may
remark that the verb haya appears in more
than one lexical entry. One of them should
be accepted. We shall preface the
description of the stage of semantic
elimination with an account of its
fundamental characteristics.

4.1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.997759506666667">
Every natural language is a means of
describing the world. It contains symbols
of concepts (concrete, abstract or
imaginary). Speakers of the language use
these symbols in order to designate these
concepts as they occur in the world.10
10 See Ostler, 1995:221, who emphasizes the
world-outlook common to all languages:
“... there is a fair degree of comparability
among the units engaged by each language,
just as there is a fair degree of similarity
between the features of the human condition
that they describe. We all have the same sense-
organs, live in modern Western societies with
other human beings, confront the same tasks of
providing food, clothing and shelters for
It is true that most of the words in
every natural language are symbols of
concepts, of actions, and of the
relationships between them. But, as was
pointed out above, every natural language
also contains other, organizing elements,
which do not symbolize concepts or
actions and do not refer to the extra-
linguistic world. These elements organize
the other words around them: this is the
difference between organizing elements
and symbolic terms. By “Organizing
Elements” we are not referring only to
what are called “grammatical words”, such
as ki in Hebrew, or “that” in English –
words which do not refer to any entity in
the world outside the language, but give
information about the other words in the
expression; these words (such as ki,
“that”, ¡ello, “whose”) inform us, for
instance, that what follows them is
intended to provide details of whatever
preceded them, or to describe it in a
particular way. “Organizing Elements”
also include morphological details which
have a linguistic meaning, such as
indications of gender (bianco – bianca in
Spanish), of number, (boy – boys in
English), or person (vide – videsti in
Italian) a hint to the definiteness of what
follows (a – the in English), case endings
which indicate the syntactic function of
the concept symbolized by a noun in
relation to an operation in the world
indicated by a verb in the expression (in
Arabic, baytuun as subject – baytaan as
object), and so forth. All of these are
morphological means, which serve to
organize conceptual symbols.
In contrast to the conceptual elements,
the organizing elements in the expression
differ as between languages not only in
their external form, but also in their
nature. Languages differ from each other
in their systems of organizing symbols.
Thus, what is unique in every natural
language is concentrated in the organizing

aided by much the same degree of technical
progress and so on.” See also Whorf
1956:138ff. Both authors speak of Western
societies.
elements, and far less in the lexical sphere.
The dictionary that we constructed is
based on these assumptions. It is first and
foremost a “dictionary of human
concepts”; but we also had to include the
organizing elements in it. We shall now
describe this dictionary.

4.2 The two parts of the
conceptual dictionary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969681818182">
Standard dictionaries are arranged in
alphabetical order, with the category of
each lexical entry noted. Our dictionary is
divided from the first into two main
dictionaries: one for nouns, and one for
verbs. This will shortly be discussed in
detail; but, first, we may observe that since
the same Hebrew word frequently serves
to symbolize several concepts (whether
this be a homograph, polysemy or
homonym), we add an index number to the
lexical entry: for instance, cir1
(“delegate”) is a different concept from
cir2 (“hinge, pivot”), even though in
Hebrew both of these concepts are
symbolized by the same word, cir.
Similarly, ¡eq ‘1 means low barometric
pressure, whereas ¡eq ‘2 means an
electrical wall-plug: both concepts are
symbolized by ¡eq ‘. In both of these
instances, we introduced two different
entries.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999882">
4.3 Dictionary of noun concepts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.957975372093023">
An entry in the dictionary of noun
concepts consists of a list of the essential
features of the concept. Here are some
examples: The conceptual entries of bayt
read as follows:
bayt1: {construct}{site}{receptacle}
{concrete}{property}.
bayt2: {site} {receptacle}{intimate}
{family}.
bayt3: {word}{information}
{work of art}{poetry}.
The words in curly brackets indicate
features of the concept (in our dictionary
they are in Hebrew, but have been
translated for this article). We began the
work with an arbitrary list of about 130
features of concepts, but eventually more
were added in the course of work in order
to define new concepts, and we now have
about 170 features.11 The reader will see
that the concept bayt1 refers to the English
word “house”, bayt2 to “home”, and bayt3
to “stanza”.
The idea of a conceptual dictionary
was conceived as a means of constructing
an infrastructure for comprehensive
processing of the Hebrew language, and
not only for the construction of an efficient
search engine. This base has already
served in the construction of a Hebrew
“Reading Machine” for the blind12. Recall
that in order to read a Hebrew text the
whole sentence must be read. Sometimes a
shorter context is sufficient. The
conceptual dictionary is intended to enable
the sentence containing the given word to
be read accurately by using a sophisticated
procedure that takes into account all the
possible readings of every word in the
sentence and by reading the whole
sentence, and not simply word by word.
We must now describe the dictionary of
verbs.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998789">
4.3 The dictionary of verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97486405">
The dictionary of noun concepts by
itself cannot activate the algorithm
required for correct reading of the Hebrew
sentence. A dictionary of verbal concepts
is also required.13 C.C. Fillmore (1968)
11 Miller’s WordNet is a mine of features,
many of them but not all have been used in our
engine. See especially Miller, 1993.
12 In the years 1996-98 an Israeli company
(Eastek) developed a “reading machine” for
the use of the blind in Israel, using this base in
its first version.
13 Stern’s Verb Dictionary, 1994, is not a
conceptual dictionary. Although it includes in
every lexical entry the particles to be found in
expressions in which the verbal entry is
central, it does not relate to thematic
arguments and their semantic features.
opened new linguistic horizons by putting
the verb in the center of the expression,
and showing how all the other parts of the
sentence should obey the demands of the
verb. (Tesnière should be mentioned here
as the “father–figure”, as Somers 1987,
p.1 emphasizes, but note what follows on
the same page, as well as in Ch.2.) We
exploit this concept to the full, and extend
it to build a dictionary of conceptual
entries related to actions in the world.14
Therefore, the dictionary of verbs
contains in the entry of every single verb
everything that that particular verb
requires to be included in the sentence.
First of all, the verb’s entry includes the
answer to the question: what specific
thematic functions are required in the
sentence to which this particular verb is
central,15 and what semantic features must
the noun phrases which perform these
thematic functions possess.16 2 The
thematic functions themselves are
common to all men: for example, the
thematic function “agent” or “experiencer”
exists in most sentences in various
languages. This also applies to the
thematic functions “theme” and
“instrument”.
In our dictionary, however, the verbal
entry also contains organizing elements: in
the first instance, the prepositions that the
verb requires or allows to be placed before
the noun phrases. We included the
prepositions in the verb dictionary in order
to solve the problem of the prepositions
individually and rigorously. Basically, a
preposition is an organizing element: it
springs not from reality, but from the
conventions appropriate to each particular
language, and relates to reality only partly
and, in general, quite vaguely. In
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.943365555555556">
14 In honor of Fillmore my students call our
conceptual dictionary “Fillmore Dictionary”.
15 The same ides is sometimes called, less
clearly, “selectional restrictions” (Chomsky,
1965,1984).
16 Compare some examples of entries, or “case
frames”, suggested by various authors in
computational linguistics in Somers, 1987
illuminating book, mainly in Ch.11.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994356">
organizing the material in this way, there
is no need to deal with the problem of
classifying “types” of verbs (see the
discussion in Somers 1987: 70-74, and
283 et seq.), or to categorize them
according to “selectional restrictions” (see
note 15).
Secondly, some adverbs must appear
in the verb’s entry in the dictionary: some
as optional elements; others, occasionally,
as necessary elements. In every case they
are labeled as fulfilling a secondary
thematic function, to which we give the
variable code NP3 or NP4 (NP1 agrees in
person, number and gender to the verb,
i.e., it is the subject, NP2 is usually the
theme). Round brackets show that the
occurrence of this element is optional. But
there are also “external” adverbs, which
cannot be included in the lexical entry of
the verb even though they may appear
frequently in many input sentences. In the
main, they indicate the time or place of the
action, or function as “sentential adverbs”
which describe the external circumstances
of the event. When such an adverb appears
in an input sentence (it may appear as an
unidentified element in a sentence for
analysis) we give it the symbol of a noun
phrase (NP), with a special index number:
NP8 or NP9. In various systems of
linguistic analysis it is usual to mark
adverbs PP. However, this symbol seems
superfluous and we have preferred to mark
this element as NP, with a preposition
preceding it (in our system, a preposition
may also be “ ”). A similar problem may
arise with adjectives. They, too, are not
included among the requirements of the
verbs but, of course, they occur in the
input sentences. We built a separate
dictionary for adjectives. It constitutes a
separate section of the noun dictionary,
and its entries may be added to the noun
(with the organizational and semantic
limitations of their lexical entries) or
function independently as separate NP’s.
Thirdly, in many conceptual entries
extra details are sometimes included, for
example, special modifications of gender
or number, the addition of epithets
appropriate to one of the required noun
combinations, idioms, etc. Another
example of elements that are not
connected with a concept arising from
reality is to be found in verbs expressing
thought or speech. They require a
subordinate clause which is characterized
by the feature “{contents}”, but the
content is unrestricted (in Arabic grammar
these are known as “verbs of the heart”).
This is a syntactic condition, and may,
therefore, differ among languages. As can
be seen, the conceptual dictionary is not
purely semantic. It also contains many
syntactic elements, and even some
morphological details. In our dictionary
we have formulated approximately ten
thousand verb entries. The noun dictionary
at the moment consists of thirty five
thousand entries.
Here are some examples of
conceptual verb entries as they appear in
our dictionary, followed by some
explanatory notes.

As can be seen, the Hebrew verb pitte×
signifies three conceptual entries, which in
other languages could well be expressed
by three completely different and

It will be recalled that we first identified a
verb among the readings of the words, and
then dealt with the elimination of
syntactically improper readings. We now
turn to the conceptual dictionaries to see
whether the NP&apos;s accord with the expected
thematic role of the proposed verb, and
whether the NP’s contain the appropriate
semantic features. This procedure is
repeated for each possible reading of a
string as a verb in order to discover all
possible interpretations of the sentence.
The final results usually contain one
interpretation only, the intended one. But
sometimes more than one interpretation is
received. This is for one of two reasons:
either the program discovers a true and
appropriate reading that a human being did
not think of, or the interpretation does not
fit conditions in the real world. To include
some means of checking knowledge of the
world in the program would, of course, be
a formidable problem. But these results
are quite rare, and presented in the results
only as another possibility, besides the

6. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99978615625">
The analysis and identification of correct
readings of words in Hebrew script is far
from being a simple task. The correct
reading of any word is achieved only as a
result of reading the rest of the words of
the complete clause and sentence. We
had
to invest much work to solve this problem
and to build a complex system of
programs before we could have achieved a
high-grade search engine, which is far
better than other existing suggestions. See
appendix for comparison.
As noted above we succeeded in
producing this engine only on the
assumption that a Hebrew word must be
read not on its own but in accordance with
the reading of a complete sentence. We
found that we achieved a powerful
program, constituting a comprehensive
infrastructure, for processing the Hebrew
language for the computer. This
infrastructure has already produced other
results (the reading machine for the blind,
see note 12), and it enables us to begin to
work on automatic translation from
Hebrew to other languages -– a task which
has never yet been attempted.184 It seems
that this method of translation by
computer may be suitable to any language,
and could be a contribution to translations
from other languages.

<abstract confidence="0.997255896296301">This article describes the construction of a morphological, syntactic and semantic analyzer to operate a high-grade search engine for Hebrew texts. A good search must be In Hebrew or Arabic script most of the vowels are not written, many particles are attached to the word without space, a double consonant is written with one letter, and some letters signify both vowels and consonants. Thus, almost every string of characters may designate many words (the average in Hebrew is almost three words). As a consequence, deciphering a word necessitates reading the whole sentence. Our model is Fillmore’s framework of an expression with a verb as its center. The engine eliminates readings of words unsuited to the syntax or the semantic structure of the sentence. In every verbal entry of our conceptual dictionary the features of the noun phrases (NP’s) required by the verb are included. When all the correct readings of all the strings of characters in the sentence have been identified, the program chooses the proper occurrences of the searched word in the text. Approximately 95% of the results by our search engine match those in the query. It is easy to construct a search engine that, in a given text, will find all the occurrences of the string of characters specified in the query. In Hebrew script, however, the string of characters that makes up a word may also be interpreted as designating other words. Almost every word in Hebrew script can be read as one of an average of three words. This is because Hebrew script is fundamentally defective: (1) Most vowels in a given word have no sign in the script. (2) Particles are attached with no intervening space to the string of characters that makes up the following word. (3) A geminated consonant is written as one letter, like a not-geminated consonant. (4) Several letters serve as both vowels and consonants. Threfore, it is impossible to identify the word stated in the query by its form: if we try to do so, we would obtain all the occurrences which are written in the same way but are, in fact, different words. Since only 20-30% of the words so obtained are actually occurrences of the required word, the users have to check every word in the result obtained in order to decide whether it is actually the one In order to solve this problem, some systems recommend that every query should contain some other words that are often found close to the stipulated But such a search may lead to a loss of important occurrences of the required word. Neither a frequency list of words nor another statistical device can be an ultimate answer in our search of accurate and full device. A statistical approach ensures that some mistakes or 1This happened in the case of the programs of Pador, Taqdin, Dinim and others, who offer a search engine for legal texts. It is well known that many lawyers have stopped using them, and prefer to conduct a manual search. 2For example, the Contahal company suggested conducting a cross-check. omissions will always exist. Also, eliminating certain readings by an examination of the words in the short will not ensure it ensure since a large number of the strings that appear in the result will not be relevant to the question. (Choueka and Lusignan, 1985; Choueka, 1990). We can obtain a correct reading of a word only if we can make a correct reading of the whole sentence. In order to do this, we must eliminate all the unsuitable readings of every string of characters in the sentence, and leave only one reading. To this end, we had to go through the following stages: 1. First, we adopted a phonemic script, a method of writing Hebrew in Latin characters, in which each vowel has its character, the particles are separated from the following word, geminated consonants are represented by two identical letters, and vowels and consonants are given completely letters 2. Now we are able to carry out a morphological analysis revealing all the word’s components. By examining the results, the correct reading could be clearly seen. This would be impossible in Hebrew script. constructed a complete, exact morphological analyzer for Hebrew words, which also identifies inflections and attached particles. 3. Having perfected morphological analyzer, which provides a complete set of details for the analysis of any possible reading of a string of characters, we could write a program 3The phonemic script contains four diacritics: ¬, ¡, Ð, also À (or `) and ¿ (or ‘). ISOin ~ornan/ papers). Several programs for analysis of Hebrew morphology use the regular Hebrew script also for the output. See Bentor et al 1992, Segal, 1999, Carmel and Maarek, 1999 (a statistical filter based on Bentor et al). The problem is that in this way one can show the diverse readings only with the traditional Hebrew dots and points, many of them superfluous. Our method is clearer since we use Latin characters through the whole work. which checks every suggested reading of a word, and eliminates readings unsuitable to the syntax of the possibly required sentence. 4. Even a syntactic reading does not ensure that each of the strings in the sentence is indeed a proper reading of the relevant Syntactic elimination may leave many words that do not suit a meaningful sentence. Further semantic eliminating is required. 5. For this purpose we compiled a complete conceptual dictionary of the Hebrew language. It is based on Fillmore’s ideas about case grammar (Fillmore, 1968), according to which the verb is the center of the expression: it is a function whose arguments are the noun phrases. In every conceptual entry in our dictionary of verbs there appear the semantic, syntactic and morphological features demanded by the verb to exist in the NP’s of the sentence, -including the prepositions, which precede them. Since dictionary includes also the features of the arguments (NP’s) in the sentence, it eliminates readings of words that are suitable syntactically but not semantically. Semantic check enables us to discriminate both between different readings of same string of Hebrew characters as well as between the different meanings of each of the readings. In this way we completed the necessary basis for the production of an excellent search engine: it will respond to any question only with the occurrences which bear the stipulated meaning, even though the same reading of the characters may have several meanings. The contents of the article are as follows: In section 2 we shall explain how we establish all possible readings of a string of characters. Section 3 shows how we use syntactic features to eliminate readings that do not fit the syntactic context; then we describe our conceptual dictionary. Section 4 shows how we can eliminate readings that are possible syntactically but not semantically. Finally, in section 5 we shall explain how we choose the appropriate meaning of the word by using the dictionary. Section 6 concludes the article. 2. The morphological stage Our algorithm consists of three stages: morphological, syntactic and semantic. Here we shall describe the first stage, the morphological. The strings of characters are taken from the Hebrew text in Hebrew script, and every string is analyzed. As was mentioned above, Hebrew script some of the attaches particles to the following word, and does not use double characters to specify geminated letters (see Ornan, 1991); also, some of the characters serve either as vowels or as consonants. It is advisable to be able to read the text in a script that does have these We use the phonemic script of ISO (FDIS 259-3). Thus, for instance, the Hebrew word HRKBT can be read in any of the following ways: hirkabta, hirkabt, harkabat ha-rakkebt, h-rakabt, h-rakabta In the morphological stage, each of these possibilities is written at the beginning of a separate line, followed by all the grammatical details of the reading: hrkbt V hirkib ,-,-,ta ,p,2,+,#,s -,-,-,-,hrkbt V hirkib ,-,-,t ,p,2,#,+,s -,-,-,-,hrkbt N harkaba ,c,-,t ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,hrkbt N rakkebt ,a,-,- ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,hahrkbt V rakab ,-,-,t ,p,-,#,+,s -,-,-,-,hhrkbt V rakab ,-,-,ta ,p,-,+,#,s -,-,-,-,h- 4Ide and (1998:2) mention this as a cause of the need to “disambiguate” Semitic languages. I would have been more correct for them to refer in their article to the system of writing rather then the languages. 5See Ornan, 1987, Ornan and Katz, 1994. See note 3. lq×nwh V laqax ,-,-,nu ,p,1,+,+,p 3,#,+,s,h The given Hebrew word is the first column. The second column is the category. The third column is the lexical entry. The following column gives the status of the word (construct, inflected or absolute). Next come the prefix and suffix of the word, the tense (for a verb), person, gender (masc., fem. or both) and number (s or p), and then details about person, gender and number of the attached (see the last example and the attached pronoun itself. The last column specifies attached particles. This morphological analysis is based on a program which uses a complete based on a comprehensive grammar of all possible Hebrew wordpatterns – including, of course, all inflections, regular and irregular. 3. The syntactic stage Each of these lines presents one possible reading of the given word. But usually only one reading is acceptable in any given sentence. Therefore, we must eliminate those readings, which are morphologically but incorrect in the given The first elimination is syntactic, and it is done in the realm of one “Syntactic Unit”, i.e., a clause which includes one verb and is bounded by a “sign of separation”, mainly subordinating or certain At this stage all possible analyses of the strings of characters are displayed. Now, the program attempts to combine each line of every word with every one of the lines of all other words. The correctness of the combination is checked with all possible 6In general, we used Even-Shoshan, 1994, which is still considered to be the best. 7An interesting attempt to decipher a text in Hebrew script - Nirenburg and Ben Asher, 1984. 8“Short context rules” are not a satisfactory solution, while our full syntactic analysis is easily derived from the Conceptual Dictionary, as explained in what follows. sequences of other words. Practically, only a small number of these combinations make a sentence that is syntactically How is the syntactic test performed? The program computes every combination of possible strings of words. For example, giving the sentence HBWQR ZRªH £M£ ªMH (in Hebrew script – &amp;quot;hot sun rose this morning&amp;quot;) will render the following analysis of all readings of the words of this sentence: hbwqr N boqr ,a,-,- ,-,3,+,#,s -,-,-,-,hahbwqr N boqer ,a,-,- ,-,3,+,#,s -,-,-,-,hazrxh N zarxa ,a,-,- ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,zrxh N zerx ,i,-,- ,-,3,+,#,s 3,#,+,s,h zrxh V zarax ,-,-,h ,p,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,jmj N jammaj ,a,-,- ,-,3,+,#,s -,-,-,-,jmj N jammaj ,c,-,- ,-,3,+,#,s -,-,-,-,jmj N jemj ,a,-,- ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,jmj N jemj ,c,-,- ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,jmj A jammaj ,a,-,- ,-,-,+,#,s -,-,-,-,jmj V jimmej ,-,-,- ,i,2,+,#,s -,-,-,-,jmj V maj ,-,-,- ,p,3,+,#,s -,-,-,-,jejmj V maj ,-,-,- ,r,-,+,#,s -,-,-,-,jexmh N xema ,a,-,- ,-,3,#,+,s -,-,-,-,xmh A xamma ,a,-,- ,-,-,#,+,s -,-,-,-,xmh N xamma ,a,-,- ,-,-,#,+,s -,-,-,-,- This short expression provides 144 sentences to be checked: 2x3x8x3=144. The syntactic stage will eliminate the great majority of invalid sequences of possible readings. We shall not discuss them all here – only make some remarks about a few clear cases for elimination. For the readings boqer function syntactically as the subject of the sentence, since they are masculine, and no verb in the rest of the sentence which is preceded by subordinating is masculine (agreement is needed). Similarly, the second word cannot be a feminine noun, and no verb agrees subject) in the analyses of the other words. 9There has been much research on syntactic analysis by means of a computer program; for instance, Wintner and Ornan, 1995. Herz and Rimon, 1992, also deal mainly with syntactic problems. Levinger et al., 1995 demonstrate methods of eliminating syntactically incorrect morphological readings. See, too, Levinger, 1992. First, the program looks for a verb. When a verb is identified, the program checks possible nouns that can be the syntactic subject. It then checks other NP’s and PP’s, possible adjectives and adverbs. Mainly because the order of words in Hebrew is rather free, the syntactic stage usually leaves a few possible sentences that may be accepted as proper readings of the input sentence from the syntactic point of view. But some of these possibly correct syntactic readings may possess improper semantic!! features, which should not be accepted. We have a special treatment for sentences without a verb (this may occur in Hebrew and other languages, especially Semitic): if the program does not identify a verb in the input sentence, it adds the be”) in the appropriate gender, number and person, and the review process is repeated. Our dictionary of verbs is described below. Here we may that the verb in more than one lexical entry. One of them should be accepted. We shall preface the description of the stage of semantic elimination with an account of its fundamental characteristics. 4. The conceptual approach Every natural language is a means of describing the world. It contains symbols of concepts (concrete, abstract or imaginary). Speakers of the language use these symbols in order to designate these as they occur in the 10See Ostler, 1995:221, who emphasizes the world-outlook common to all languages: “... there is a fair degree of comparability among the units engaged by each language, just as there is a fair degree of similarity between the features of the human condition that they describe. We all have the same senseorgans, live in modern Western societies with other human beings, confront the same tasks of providing food, clothing and shelters for It is true that most of the words in every natural language are symbols of concepts, of actions, and of the relationships between them. But, as was pointed out above, every natural language also contains other, organizing elements, which do not symbolize concepts or actions and do not refer to the extralinguistic world. These elements organize the other words around them: this is the difference between organizing elements and symbolic terms. By “Organizing Elements” we are not referring only to what are called “grammatical words”, such Hebrew, or “that” in English – words which do not refer to any entity in the world outside the language, but give information about the other words in the these words (such as “whose”) inform us, for instance, that what follows them is intended to provide details of whatever preceded them, or to describe it in a particular way. “Organizing Elements” also include morphological details which have a linguistic meaning, such as of gender – bianca of number, – boys or person – videsti Italian) a hint to the definiteness of what – the English), case endings which indicate the syntactic function of the concept symbolized by a noun in relation to an operation in the world indicated by a verb in the expression (in subject – object), and so forth. All of these are morphological means, which serve to organize conceptual symbols. In contrast to the conceptual elements, the organizing elements in the expression differ as between languages not only in their external form, but also in their nature. Languages differ from each other in their systems of organizing symbols. Thus, what is unique in every natural language is concentrated in the organizing ourselves and our families, are confronted or aided by much the same degree of technical progress and so on.” See also 1956:138ff. Both authors speak of Western societies. elements, and far less in the lexical sphere. The dictionary that we constructed is based on these assumptions. It is first and foremost a “dictionary of human concepts”; but we also had to include the organizing elements in it. We shall now describe this dictionary. two parts of the conceptual dictionary Standard dictionaries are arranged in alphabetical order, with the category of each lexical entry noted. Our dictionary is divided from the first into two main dictionaries: one for nouns, and one for verbs. This will shortly be discussed in detail; but, first, we may observe that since the same Hebrew word frequently serves to symbolize several concepts (whether this be a homograph, polysemy or homonym), we add an index number to the entry: for instance, (“delegate”) is a different concept from pivot”), even though in Hebrew both of these concepts are by the same word, low barometric whereas an electrical wall-plug: both concepts are by In both of these instances, we introduced two different entries. of noun concepts An entry in the dictionary of noun concepts consists of a list of the essential features of the concept. Here are some The conceptual entries of read as follows: {construct}{site}{receptacle} {concrete}{property}. {site} {receptacle}{intimate} {family}. {word}{information} {work of art}{poetry}. The words in curly brackets indicate features of the concept (in our dictionary they are in Hebrew, but have been translated for this article). We began the work with an arbitrary list of about 130 features of concepts, but eventually more were added in the course of work in order to define new concepts, and we now have 170 The reader will see the concept to the English “house”, “home”, and to “stanza”. The idea of a conceptual dictionary was conceived as a means of constructing an infrastructure for comprehensive processing of the Hebrew language, and not only for the construction of an efficient search engine. This base has already served in the construction of a Hebrew Machine” for the Recall that in order to read a Hebrew text the whole sentence must be read. Sometimes a shorter context is sufficient. The conceptual dictionary is intended to enable the sentence containing the given word to be read accurately by using a sophisticated procedure that takes into account all the possible readings of every word in the sentence and by reading the whole sentence, and not simply word by word. We must now describe the dictionary of verbs. 4.3 The dictionary of verbs The dictionary of noun concepts by itself cannot activate the algorithm required for correct reading of the Hebrew sentence. A dictionary of verbal concepts also C.C. Fillmore (1968) 11Miller’s WordNet is a mine of features, many of them but not all have been used in our engine. See especially Miller, 1993. 12In the years 1996-98 an Israeli company (Eastek) developed a “reading machine” for the use of the blind in Israel, using this base in its first version. 13Stern’s Dictionary, is not a conceptual dictionary. Although it includes in every lexical entry the particles to be found in expressions in which the verbal entry is central, it does not relate to thematic arguments and their semantic features. opened new linguistic horizons by putting the verb in the center of the expression, and showing how all the other parts of the sentence should obey the demands of the verb. (Tesnière should be mentioned here as the “father–figure”, as Somers 1987, emphasizes, but notewhat follows on the same page, as well as in Ch.2.) We exploit this concept to the full, and extend it to build a dictionary of conceptual related to actions in the Therefore, the dictionary of verbs contains in the entry of every single verb everything that that particular verb requires to be included in the sentence. First of all, the verb’s entry includes the answer to the question: what specific thematic functions are required in the sentence to which this particular verb is and what semantic features must the noun phrases which perform these functions 2The thematic functions themselves are common to all men: for example, the thematic function “agent” or “experiencer” exists in most sentences in various languages. This also applies to the thematic functions “theme” and “instrument”. In our dictionary, however, the verbal entry also contains organizing elements: in the first instance, the prepositions that the verb requires or allows to be placed before the noun phrases. We included the prepositions in the verb dictionary in order to solve the problem of the prepositions individually and rigorously. Basically, a preposition is an organizing element: it springs not from reality, but from the conventions appropriate to each particular language, and relates to reality only partly and, in general, quite vaguely. In 14In honor of Fillmore my students call our conceptual dictionary “Fillmore Dictionary”. 15The same ides is sometimes called, less clearly, “selectional restrictions” (Chomsky, 1965,1984). 16Compare some examples of entries, or “case frames”, suggested by various authors in computational linguistics in Somers, 1987 illuminating book, mainly in Ch.11. organizing the material in this way, there is no need to deal with the problem of classifying “types” of verbs (see the discussion in Somers 1987: 70-74, and 283 et seq.), or to categorize them according to “selectional restrictions” (see note 15). Secondly, some adverbs must appear in the verb’s entry in the dictionary: some as optional elements; others, occasionally, as necessary elements. In every case they are labeled as fulfilling a secondary thematic function, to which we give the variable code NP3 or NP4 (NP1 agrees in person, number and gender to the verb, i.e., it is the subject, NP2 is usually the theme). Round brackets show that the occurrence of this element is optional. But there are also “external” adverbs, which cannot be included in the lexical entry of the verb even though they may appear frequently in many input sentences. In the main, they indicate the time or place of the action, or function as “sentential adverbs” which describe the external circumstances of the event. When such an adverb appears in an input sentence (it may appear as an unidentified element in a sentence for analysis) we give it the symbol of a noun phrase (NP), with a special index number: NP8 or NP9. In various systems of linguistic analysis it is usual to mark adverbs PP. However, this symbol seems superfluous and we have preferred to mark this element as NP, with a preposition preceding it (in our system, a preposition may also be “ ”). A similar problem may arise with adjectives. They, too, are not included among the requirements of the verbs but, of course, they occur in the input sentences. We built a separate dictionary for adjectives. It constitutes a separate section of the noun dictionary, and its entries may be added to the noun (with the organizational and semantic limitations of their lexical entries) or function independently as separate NP’s. Thirdly, in many conceptual entries extra details are sometimes included, for example, special modifications of gender or number, the addition of epithets appropriate to one of the required noun combinations, idioms, etc. Another example of elements that are not connected with a concept arising from reality is to be found in verbs expressing thought or speech. They require a subordinate clause which is characterized by the feature “{contents}”, but the content is unrestricted (in Arabic grammar these are known as “verbs of the heart”). This is a syntactic condition, and may, therefore, differ among languages. As can be seen, the conceptual dictionary is not purely semantic. It also contains many syntactic elements, and even some morphological details. In our dictionary we have formulated approximately ten thousand verb entries. The noun dictionary at the moment consists of thirty five thousand entries. Here are some examples of conceptual verb entries as they appear in our dictionary, followed by some explanatory notes. Pitte×1 [= develop a film] NP1 AGENT {human, role, org} NP2 THEME &amp;quot;et&amp;quot; {printed matter, picture} pitte×2 [= open a knot] NP1 AGENT {human, role, org} NP2 THEME &amp;quot;et&amp;quot; {knot, &amp;quot;×gor&amp;quot;} [= carve] NP1 AGENT {human, role} THEME &amp;quot; {writing, word, (NP3) INSTRUMENT &amp;quot;b-&amp;quot; {tool, sharp, acute} (NP4) INSTRUMENT &amp;quot;‘al&amp;quot; {solid, platform, article} can be seen, the Hebrew verb signifies three conceptual entries, which in other languages could well be expressed by three completely different and dissimilar words. In the following examples there are also limitations of organizing elements. Here we should add some remarks about special symbols and explanations of the names of the thematic functions: % indicates that the succeeding word signifies a syntactic structure, and not a thematic function. Double quotation marks 17There are some other meanings to this verb, but in order to explain our approach these three suffice. (“ ”) indicate Hebrew words, particularly prepositions (such as “et”, “b-”, “ ¿al”) which are required by the verb or are parts of idioms. Round brackets “( )” denote an optional function which is not obligatory to the sentence to be analyzed. A diagonal stroke “/” indicates another possibility, shown in the expression which follows it. hebin [= understand] NP1 EXPERIENCER {human, role, org} NP2 &amp;quot;¡e-&amp;quot; %SENTENCE / NP2 “et” AIMED-AT {abstract, info} ¡imme¡1 [= serve ] NP1 INFLUENCER {-} NP2 THEME {human, org} (NP3) {&amp;quot;l-&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;k-&amp;quot;} GOAL {action} ¡imme¡2 [= be used as ] NP1 THEME {human, instrument, site, construction} NP2 &amp;quot;btor&amp;quot; FUNCTION { human, instrument, site, construction} ‘arak1 [= set a table] NP1 AGENT {human, role} NP2 &amp;quot;et&amp;quot; THEME {&amp;quot;¡ulxan&amp;quot;}[=table, an idiom] ‘arak2 [= organize ] NP1 AGENT {human, org.} NP2 &amp;quot;et&amp;quot; THEME {act, happening} ‘arak3 [= edit ] NP1 AGENT {human, org.} NP2 &amp;quot;et&amp;quot; THEME {printed_matter, work of art} zarax [= rise (sun) ] NP1 THEME {source_of_light, source_of_heat, strong} rakab [= ride ] NP1 AGENT {human} (NP2) &amp;quot;‘al&amp;quot; THEME {four_legged_ animal, vehicle} (NP3) &amp;quot;l-&amp;quot; TO-LOC {site, place, happening, human} (NP4) &amp;quot;mi-&amp;quot; FROM- LOC {site, place, happening, human} Hebrew preposition sometimes rendered as &amp;quot; &amp;quot; (especially when it precedes an entry noun without a definite article); but, since this is always so, it is not worth printing &amp;quot; &amp;quot; separately for each entry; so this possibility is included in the program. Another example: the expression xenn an idiom, and it seems as if one could treat the combination as one word. But since there could also be an expression in which the two words of the idiom were separated, and in view of the morphological difficulties to which such a solution could lead, we prefer to formulate it as a simple one-word verb, located in a lexical entry verb requires obligatory completion in this with NP2 status. maca`1 [=&amp;quot;NP3 likes NP1&amp;quot;] NP1 AIMED-AT { } NP2 THEME {&amp;quot;xenn&amp;quot;} NP3 &amp;quot;b-‘einei&amp;quot; AGENT {human, animate} After our description of the conceptual dictionary, we shall now describe the process of semantic elimination. 5. The semantic stage It will be recalled that we first identified a verb among the readings of the words, and then dealt with the elimination of syntactically improper readings. We now turn to the conceptual dictionaries to see whether the NP&apos;s accord with the expected thematic role of the proposed verb, and whether the NP’s contain the appropriate semantic features. This procedure is repeated for each possible reading of a string as a verb in order to discover all possible interpretations of the sentence. The final results usually contain one interpretation only, the intended one. But sometimes more than one interpretation is received. This is for one of two reasons: either the program discovers a true and appropriate reading that a human being did not think of, or the interpretation does not fit conditions in the real world. To include some means of checking knowledge of the world in the program would, of course, be a formidable problem. But these results are quite rare, and presented in the results only as another possibility, besides the correct one. 6. Conclusion The analysis and identification of correct readings of words in Hebrew script is far from being a simple task. The correct reading of any word is achieved only as a result of reading the rest of the words of the complete clause and sentence. We had to invest much work to solve this problem and to build a complex system of programs before we could have achieved a high-grade search engine, which is far better than other existing suggestions. See appendix for comparison. As noted above we succeeded in producing this engine only on the assumption that a Hebrew word must be read not on its own but in accordance with the reading of a complete sentence. We found that we achieved a powerful program, constituting a comprehensive infrastructure, for processing the Hebrew language for the computer. This infrastructure has already produced other results (the reading machine for the blind, see note 12), and it enables us to begin to work on automatic translation from Hebrew to other languages -– a task which never yet been It seems that this method of translation by computer may be suitable to any language, and could be a contribution to translations from other languages.</abstract>

Here we may remark that the verb haya appears in more than one lexical entry. One of them should be accepted. We shall preface the description of the stage of semantic elimination with an account of its fundamental characteristics. 4. The conceptual approach 4.1 Introduction Every natural language is a means of describing the world. It contains symbols of concepts (concrete, abstract or imaginary). Speakers of the language use these symbols in order to designate these concepts as they occur in the world.10 10 See Ostler, 1995:221, who emphasizes the world-outlook common to all languages: “... there is a fair degree of comparability among the units engaged by each language, just as there is a fair degree of similarity between the features of the human condition that they describe. We all have the same senseorgans, live in modern Western societies with other human beings, confront the same tasks of providing food, clothing and shelters for It is true that most of the words in every natural language are symbols of concepts, of actions, and of the relationships between them. But, as was pointed out above, every natura</context>

We shall not discuss them all here – only make some remarks about a few clear cases for elimination. For example, the readings boqr, boqer cannot function syntactically as the subject of the sentence, since they are masculine, and no verb in the rest of the sentence which is not preceded by subordinating je- (“that”) is masculine (agreement is needed). Similarly, the second word cannot be zarxa: a feminine noun, and no verb agrees with zarxa (as subject) in the analyses of the other words. 9 There has been much research on syntactic analysis by means of a computer program; for instance, Wintner and Ornan, 1995. Herz and Rimon, 1992, also deal mainly with syntactic problems. Levinger et al., 1995 demonstrate methods of eliminating syntactically incorrect morphological readings. See, too, Levinger, 1992. First, the program looks for a verb. When a verb is identified, the program checks possible nouns that can be the syntactic subject. It then checks other NP’s and PP’s, possible adjectives and adverbs. Mainly because the order of words in Hebrew is rather free, the syntactic stage usually leaves a few possible sentences that may be accepted as proper readings of the input sentence from the syntactic </context>

All of these are morphological means, which serve to organize conceptual symbols. In contrast to the conceptual elements, the organizing elements in the expression differ as between languages not only in their external form, but also in their nature. Languages differ from each other in their systems of organizing symbols. Thus, what is unique in every natural language is concentrated in the organizing ourselves and our families, are confronted or aided by much the same degree of technical progress and so on.” See also Whorf 1956:138ff. Both authors speak of Western societies. elements, and far less in the lexical sphere. The dictionary that we constructed is based on these assumptions. It is first and foremost a “dictionary of human concepts”; but we also had to include the organizing elements in it. We shall now describe this dictionary. 4.2 The two parts of the conceptual dictionary Standard dictionaries are arranged in alphabetical order, with the category of each lexical entry noted. Our dictionary is divided from the first into two main dictionaries: one for nouns, and one for verbs. This will shortly be discuss</context>
