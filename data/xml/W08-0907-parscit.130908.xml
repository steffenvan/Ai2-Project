Abstract

Tutorial dialogue has been the subject of in-
creasing attention in recent years, and it has
become evident that empirical studies of hu-
man-human tutorial dialogue can contribute
important insights to the design of computa-
tional models of dialogue. This paper reports
on a corpus study of human-human tutorial
dialogue transpiring in the course of problem-
solving in a learning environment for intro-
ductory computer science. Analyses suggest
that the choice of corrective tutorial strategy
makes a significant difference in the outcomes
of both student learning gains and self-
efficacy gains. The findings reveal that tuto-
rial strategies intended to maximize student
motivational outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy
gain) may not be the same strategies that
maximize cognitive outcomes (i.e., learning
gain). In light of recent findings that learner
characteristics influence the structure of tuto-
rial dialogue, we explore the importance of
understanding the interaction between learner
characteristics and tutorial dialogue strategy
choice when designing tutorial dialogue sys-
tems.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.995503666666667">
Providing intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) with
the ability to engage learners in rich natural lan-
guage dialogue has been a goal of the ITS commu-
nity since the inception of the field. Tutorial
dialogue has been studied in the context of a num-
ber of systems devised to support a broad range of
conversational phenomena. Systems such as
CIRCSIM (Evens and Michael 2006), BEETLE (Zinn
et al. 2002), the Geometry Explanation Tutor
(Aleven et al. 2003), Why2/Atlas (VanLehn et al.
2002), ITSpoke (Litman et al. 2006), SCOT (Pon-
Barry et al. 2006), ProPL (Lane and VanLehn
2005) and AutoTutor (Graesser et al. 2003) support
research that has begun to the see the emergence of
a core set of foundational requirements for mixed-
initiative natural language interaction that occurs in
the kind of tutorial dialogue investigated here.
Moreover, recent years have witnessed the appear-
ance of corpus studies empirically investigating
speech acts in tutorial dialogue (Marineau et al.
2000), dialogues’ correlation with learning
(Forbes-Riley et al. 2005, Core et al. 2003, Rosé et
al. 2003, Katz et al. 2003), student uncertainty in
dialogue (Liscombe et al. 2005, Forbes-Riley and
Litman 2005), and comparing text-based and spo-
ken dialogue (Litman et al. 2006).
Recent years have also seen the emergence of a
broader view of learning as a complex process in-
volving both cognitive and affective states. To
empirically explore these issues, a number of ITSs
such as AutoTutor (Jackson et al. 2007), Betty’s
Brain (Tan and Biswas 2006), ITSpoke (Forbes-
Riley et al. 2005), M-Ecolab (Rebolledo-Mendez
et al. 2006), and MORE (del Soldato and Boulay
1995) are being used as platforms to investigate the
impact of tutorial interactions on affective and mo-
tivational outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy) along with
purely cognitive measures (i.e., learning gains). A
central problem in this line of investigation is iden-

tifying tutorial strategies (e.g., Graesser et al.
1995) that can appropriately balance the tradeoffs
between cognitive and affective student outcomes
(Lepper et al. 1993). While a rich set of cognitive
and affective tutorial strategies is emerging (e.g.,
Porayska-Pomsta et al. 2004), the precise nature of
the interdependence between these types of strate-
gies is not well understood. In addition, it may be
the case that different populations of learners en-
gage in qualitatively different forms of dialogue.
Students with particular characteristics may have
specific dialogue profiles, and knowledge of such
profiles could inform the design of tutorial systems
whose strategies leverage the characteristics of the
target population. The extent to which different
tutorial strategies, and specific instances of them in
certain contexts, may be used to enhance tutorial
effectiveness is an important question to designers
of ITSs.
Given that human-human tutorial dialogue of-
fers a promising model for effective communica-
tion (Chi et al. 2001), our methodology is to study
naturally occurring tutorial dialogues in a task-
oriented learning environment to investigate the
relationship between the structure of tutorial dia-
logue, the characteristics of learners, and the im-
pact of cognitive and motivational corrective
tutorial strategies on learning and self-efficacy
(Boyer et al. in press). A text-based dialogue inter-
face was incorporated into a learning environment
for introductory computer science. In the envi-
ronment, students undertook a programming task
and conversed with human tutors while designing,
implementing, and testing Java programs.
The results of the study suggest that the choice
of corrective tutorial strategy has a significant im-
pact on the learning gains and self-efficacy of stu-
dents. These findings reinforce those of other
studies (e.g., Lepper et al. 1993, Person et al. 1995,
Keller et al. 1983) that indicate that some cognitive
and motivational goals may be at odds with one
other because a tutorial strategy designed to maxi-
mize one set of goals (e.g., cognitive goals) can
negatively impact the other. We contextualize our
findings in light of recent results that learner char-
acteristics such as self-efficacy influence the struc-
ture of task-oriented tutorial dialogue (Boyer et al.
2007), and may therefore produce important inter-
action effects when considered alongside tutorial
strategy.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
describes the corpus study, including experimental
design and tagging of dialogue and student prob-
lem-solving actions. Section 3 presents analysis
and results. Discussion and design implications
are considered in Section 4, and concluding re-
marks follow in Section 5.

2 Corpus Study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999062">
The corpus was gathered by logging text-based
dialogues between tutors and novice computer sci-
ence students. The learning task was to complete a
Java programming problem that required students
to apply fundamental concepts such as iteration,
modularization, and sequential-access data struc-
tures. This study was conducted to compare the
impact of certain corrective cognitive and motiva-
tional tutorial strategies on student learning and
self-efficacy in human-human tutoring. Specifi-
cally, the study considered the motivational strate-
gies of praise and reassurance (Lepper et al. 1993)
and the category of informational tutorial utter-
ances termed cognitive feedback (Porayska-Pomsta
et al. 2004, Tan and Biswas 2006) that followed
questionable student problem-solving action. Fol-
lowing the approach of Forbes-Riley (2005) and
others (Marineau et al. 2000), utterances from a
corpus of human-human tutorial dialogues were
annotated with dialogue acts. Then, adopting the
approach proposed by Ohlsson et al. (2007), statis-
tical modeling techniques were employed to quan-
tify the relative impact of these different tutorial
strategies on the outcomes of interest (in this case,
learning and self-efficacy gains).

2.1 Experimental Design
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999733090909091">
Subjects were students enrolled in an introductory
computer science course and were primarily
freshman or sophomore engineering majors in dis-
ciplines such as mechanical, electrical, and com-
puter engineering.
The corpus was gathered from tutor-student
interactions between 43 students and 14 tutors dur-
ing a two-week study. Tutors and students were
completely blind to each other’s characteristics as
they worked together remotely from separate labs.
Tutors observed student problem-solving actions

(e.g., programming, scrolling, executing programs)
in real time. Tutors had varying levels of tutoring
experience, and were not instructed about specific
tutorial strategies.
Subjects first completed a pre-survey including
items about self-efficacy, attitude toward computer
science, and attitude toward collaboration. Sub-
jects then completed a ten item pre-test over spe-
cific topic content. The tutorial session was
controlled at 55 minutes for all subjects, after
which subjects completed a post-survey and post-
test containing variants of the items on the pre-
versions.

2.2 Problem-Solving Tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954902439025">
The raw corpus contains 4,864 dialogue moves:
1,528 student utterances and 3,336 tutor utterances.
As a chronology of tutorial dialogue interleaved
with student problem-solving (programming) ac-
tions that took place during the tutoring sessions,
the corpus contains 29,996 programming key-
strokes and 1,277 periods of scrolling – all per-
formed by students. Other problem-solving
actions, such as opening and closing files or run-
ning the program, were sparse and were therefore
eliminated from the analyses. Of the 3,336 tutor
utterances, 1,243 occur directly after “question-
able” student problem-solving action. (The notion
of “questionable” is defined below.) This subset of
tutorial utterances serves as the basis for the tuto-
rial strategy comparison.
Student problem-solving actions were logged
throughout tutoring sessions. Two actions were
under consideration for the analysis: typing in the
programming interface and scrolling in the pro-
gram editor window. To interpret the raw logged
student problem-solving actions, these events were
automatically tagged using a heuristic measure for
correctness: if a problem-solving action was a pro-
gramming keystroke (character) that survived until
the end of the session, this event was tagged prom-
ising, to indicate it was probably correct. If a prob-
lem-solving act was a programming keystroke
(character) that did not survive until the end of the
session, the problem-solving act was tagged ques-
tionable. Both these heuristics are based on the
observation that in this tutoring context, students
solved the problem in a linear fashion and tutors
did not allow students to proceed past a step that
had incorrect code in place. Finally, periods of
consecutive scrolling were also marked question-
able because in a problem whose entire solution
fits on one printed page, scrolling was almost uni-
formly undertaken by a student who was confused
and looking for answers in irrelevant skeleton code
provided to support the programming task.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998965">
2.3 Dialogue Act Tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999205">
Because utterances communicate through two
channels, a cognitive channel and a motiva-
tional/affective channel, each utterance was
annotated with both a required cognitive dialogue
tag (Table 1) and an optional motiva-
tional/affective dialogue tag (Table 2). While no
single standardized dialogue act tag set has been
identified for tutorial dialogue, the tags applied
here were drawn from several schemes in the tuto-
rial dialogue and broader dialogue literature. A
coding scheme for tutorial dialogue in the domain
of qualitative physics influenced the creation of the
tag set (Forbes-Riley et al. 2005), as did the four-
category scheme (Marineau et al. 2000). A more
expansive general dialogue act tag set also contrib-
uted commonly occurring acts (Stolcke et al.
2000). The motivational tags were drawn from
work by Lepper (1993) on motivational strategies
of human tutors.
Table 1 displays the cognitive subset of this
dialogue act tag set, while Table 2 displays the mo-
tivational/affective tags. It should be noted that a
cognitive tag was required for each utterance,
while a motivational/affective tag was applied only
to the subset of utterances that communicated in
that channel. If an utterance constituted a strictly
motivational/affective act, its cognitive channel
was tagged with EX (EXtra-domain) indicating
there was no relevant cognitive content. On the
other hand, some utterances had both a cognitive
component and a motivational/affective compo-
nent. For example, a tutorial utterance of, “That
looks great!” would have been tagged as positive
feedback (PF) in the cognitive channel, and as
praise (P) in the motivational/affective channel. In
contrast, the tutorial move “That’s right,” would be
tagged as positive feedback (PF) in the cognitive
channel and would not be annotated with a motiva-
tional/affective tag. Table 3 shows an excerpt
from the corpus with dialogue act tags applied.

(difference between pre-survey and post-survey
scores) with mean 12.1% and median 12.5%,
which were also statistically significant
(p&lt;0.0001). Analyses revealed that statistically
significant relationships hold between tutorial
strategy and learning, as well as between tutorial
strategy and self-efficacy gains.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998426">
3.1 Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989681818182">
First, the values of learning gain and self-efficacy
gain were grouped into binary categories (“Low”,
“High”) based on the median value. We then ap-
plied multiple logistic regression with the gain
category as the predicted value. Tutorial strategy,
incoming self-efficacy rating, and pre-test score
were predictors in the model. The binarization
approach followed by multiple logistic regression
was chosen over multiple linear regression on a
continuous response variable because the learning
instruments (10 items each) and self-efficacy ques-
tionnaires (5 items each) yielded few distinct val-
ues of learning gain, meaning the response variable
(learning gain and self-efficacy gain, respectively)
would not have been truly continuous in nature.
Logistic regression is used for binary response
variables; it computes the odds of a particular out-
come over another (e.g., “Having high learning
gain versus low learning gain”) given one value of
the predictor variable over another (e.g., “The cor-
rective tutorial strategy chosen was positive cogni-
tive feedback instead of praise”).

3.2 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938872727273">
After accounting for the effects of pre-test score
and incoming self-efficacy rating (both of which
were significant in the model with p&lt;0.001), ob-
servations containing tutorial encouragement were
56% less likely to result in high learning gain than
observations without explicit tutorial encourage-
ment (p=0.001). On the other hand, an analogous
model of self-efficacy gain revealed that tutorial
encouragement was 57% more likely to result in
high self-efficacy gain compared to tutorial re-
sponses that had no explicit praise or reassurance
(p=0.054). These models suggested that the pres-
ence of tutorial encouragement in response to
questionable student problem-solving action may
enhance self-efficacy gain but detract from learn-
ing gain.
Another significant finding was that observa-
tions in which the tutor used cognitive feedback
plus praise were associated with 40% lower likeli-
hood of high learning gain than observations in
which the tutor used purely cognitive feedback.
No impact was observed on self-efficacy gain.
These results suggest that in response to question-
able student problem-solving action, to achieve
learning gains, purely cognitive feedback is pre-
ferred over cognitive feedback plus praise, while
self-efficacy gain does not appear to be impacted
either way.
Among students with low incoming self-
efficacy, observations in which the tutor employed
a standalone motivational act were 300% as likely
to be in the high self-efficacy gain group as obser-
vations in which the tutor employed a purely cog-
nitive statement or a cognitive statement combined
with encouragement (p=0.039). In contrast, among
students with high initial self-efficacy, a purely
motivational tactic resulted in 90% lower odds of
being in the high self-efficacy gain group. These
results suggest that standalone praise or reassur-
ance may be useful for increasing self-efficacy
gain among low initial self-efficacy students, but
may decrease self-efficacy gain in high initial self-
efficacy students.
Considering strictly cognitive feedback, posi-
tive feedback resulted in 190% increased odds of
high student self-efficacy gain compared to the
other cognitive strategies (p=0.0057). Positive
cognitive feedback did not differ significantly from
other types of cognitive strategies in a Chi-square
comparison with respect to learning gains
(p=0.390). The models thus suggest when dealing
with questionable student problem-solving action,
positive cognitive feedback is preferable to other
types of cognitive feedback for eliciting self-
efficacy gains, but this type of feedback is not

4 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998579661017">
The study found that the presence of direct tutorial
praise or encouragement in response to question-
able student problem-solving action increased the
odds that the student reported high self-efficacy
gain while lowering the odds of high learning gain.
The study also found that, with regard to learning
gains, purely cognitive feedback was preferable to
cognitive feedback with an explicitly motivational
component. These empirical findings are consis-
tent with theories of Lepper et al. (1993) who
found that some cognitive and affective goals in
tutoring are “at odds.” As would be predicted, the
results also echo recent quantitative results from
other tutoring domains such as qualitative physics
(Jackson et al. 2007) and river ecosystems (Tan
and Biswas 2006) that, in general, overt motiva-
tional feedback contributes to motivation but cog-
nitive feedback matters more for learning.
Of the corrective tutorial strategies that were
exhibited in the corpus, positive cognitive feed-
back emerged as an attractive approach for re-
sponding to plausibly incorrect student problem-
solving actions. Responding positively (e.g.,
“Right”) to questionable student actions is an ex-
ample of indirect correction, which is recognized
as a polite strategy (e.g., Porayska-Pomsta et al.
2004). A qualitative investigation of this phe-
nomenon revealed that in the corpus, tutors gener-
ally followed positive feedback in this context with
more substantive cognitive feedback to address the
nature of the student’s error. As such, the positive
feedback approach seems to have an implicit, yet
perceptible, motivational component while retain-
ing its usefulness as cognitive feedback.
This study found that explicit motivational acts,
when applied as corrective tutorial approaches, had
different impacts on different student subgroups.
Students with low initial self-efficacy appeared to
benefit more from praise and reassurance than stu-
dents with high initial self-efficacy. In a prior cor-
pus study to investigate the impact of learner
characteristics on tutorial dialogue (Boyer et al.
2007), we also found that learners from different
populations exhibited significantly different dia-
logue profiles. For instance, high self-efficacy
students made more declarative statements, or as-
sertions, than low self-efficacy students. In addi-
tion, tutors paired with high self-efficacy students
gave more conversational acknowledgments than
tutors paired with low self-efficacy students, de-
spite the fact that tutors were not made aware of
any learner characteristics before the tutoring ses-
sion. Additional dialogue profile differences
emerged between high and low-performing stu-
dents, as well as between males and females. To-
gether these two studies suggest that learner
characteristics influence the structure of tutorial
dialogue, and that the choice of tutorial strategy
may impact student subgroups in different ways.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983424242424">
The work reported here represents a first step to-
ward understanding the effects of learner charac-
teristics on task-oriented tutorial dialogue and the
use of feedback. Results suggest that positive cog-
nitive feedback may prove to be an appropriate
strategy for responding to questionable student
problem-solving actions in task-oriented tutorial
situations because of its potential for addressing
the sometimes competing cognitive and affective
needs of students. For low self-efficacy students, it
was found that direct standalone encouragement
can be used to bolster self-efficacy, but care must
be used in correctly diagnosing student self-
efficacy because the same standalone encourage-
ment does not appear helpful for high self-efficacy
students. These preliminary findings highlight the
importance of understanding the interaction be-
tween learner characteristics and tutorial strategy
as it relates to the design of tutorial dialogue sys-
tems.
Several directions for future work appear prom-
ising. First, it will be important to explore the in-
fluence of learner characteristics on tutorial
dialogue in the presence of surface level informa-
tion about students’ utterances. This line of inves-
tigation is of particular interest given recent results
indicating that lexical cohesion in tutorial dialogue
with low-performing students is found to be highly
correlated with learning (Ward and Litman 2006).
Second, while the work reported here has consid-
ered a limited set of motivational dialogue acts,
namely praise and reassurance, future work should
target an expanded set of affective dialogue acts to
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999810928571429">
facilitate continued exploration of motivational and
affective phenomena in this context. Finally, the
current results reflect human-human tutoring
strategies that proved to be effective; however, it
remains to be seen whether these same strategies
can be successfully employed in tutorial dialogue
systems. Continuing to identify and empirically
compare the effectiveness of alternative tutorial
strategies will build a solid foundation for choos-
ing and implementing strategies that consider
learner characteristics and successfully balance the
cognitive and affective concerns surrounding the
complex processes of teaching and learning
through tutoring.

<abstract confidence="0.9944975">Tutorial dialogue has been the subject of increasing attention in recent years, and it has become evident that empirical studies of human-human tutorial dialogue can contribute important insights to the design of computational models of dialogue. This paper reports on a corpus study of human-human tutorial dialogue transpiring in the course of problemsolving in a learning environment for introductory computer science. Analyses suggest that the choice of corrective tutorial strategy makes a significant difference in the outcomes of both student learning gains and selfefficacy gains. The findings reveal that tutorial strategies intended to maximize student motivational outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy gain) may not be the same strategies that maximize cognitive outcomes (i.e., learning gain). In light of recent findings that learner characteristics influence the structure of tutorial dialogue, we explore the importance of understanding the interaction between learner characteristics and tutorial dialogue strategy choice when designing tutorial dialogue systems.</abstract>

These findings reinforce those of other studies (e.g., Lepper et al. 1993, Person et al. 1995, Keller et al. 1983) that indicate that some cognitive and motivational goals may be at odds with one other because a tutorial strategy designed to maximize one set of goals (e.g., cognitive goals) can negatively impact the other. We contextualize our findings in light of recent results that learner characteristics such as self-efficacy influence the structure of task-oriented tutorial dialogue (Boyer et al. 2007), and may therefore produce important interaction effects when considered alongside tutorial strategy. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the corpus study, including experimental design and tagging of dialogue and student problem-solving actions. Section 3 presents analysis and results. Discussion and design implications are considered in Section 4, and concluding remarks follow in Section 5. 2 Corpus Study The corpus was gathered by logging text-based dialogues between tutors and novice computer science students.

As such, the positive feedback approach seems to have an implicit, yet perceptible, motivational component while retaining its usefulness as cognitive feedback. This study found that explicit motivational acts, when applied as corrective tutorial approaches, had different impacts on different student subgroups. Students with low initial self-efficacy appeared to benefit more from praise and reassurance than students with high initial self-efficacy. In a prior corpus study to investigate the impact of learner characteristics on tutorial dialogue (Boyer et al. 2007), we also found that learners from different populations exhibited significantly different dialogue profiles. For instance, high self-efficacy students made more declarative statements, or assertions, than low self-efficacy students. In addition, tutors paired with high self-efficacy students gave more conversational acknowledgments than tutors paired with low self-efficacy students, despite the fact that tutors were not made aware of any learner characteristics before the tutoring session. Additional dialogue profile differences emerged between high and low-performing students, as well as bet</context>

Students with particular characteristics may have specific dialogue profiles, and knowledge of such profiles could inform the design of tutorial systems whose strategies leverage the characteristics of the target population. The extent to which different tutorial strategies, and specific instances of them in certain contexts, may be used to enhance tutorial effectiveness is an important question to designers of ITSs. Given that human-human tutorial dialogue offers a promising model for effective communication (Chi et al. 2001), our methodology is to study naturally occurring tutorial dialogues in a taskoriented learning environment to investigate the relationship between the structure of tutorial dialogue, the characteristics of learners, and the impact of cognitive and motivational corrective tutorial strategies on learning and self-efficacy (Boyer et al. in press). A text-based dialogue interface was incorporated into a learning environment for introductory computer science.

While no single standardized dialogue act tag set has been identified for tutorial dialogue, the tags applied here were drawn from several schemes in the tutorial dialogue and broader dialogue literature. A coding scheme for tutorial dialogue in the domain of qualitative physics influenced the creation of the tag set (Forbes-Riley et al. 2005), as did the fourcategory scheme (Marineau et al. 2000). A more expansive general dialogue act tag set also contributed commonly occurring acts (Stolcke et al. 2000). The motivational tags were drawn from work by Lepper (1993) on motivational strategies of human tutors. Table 1 displays the cognitive subset of this dialogue act tag set, while Table 2 displays the motivational/affective tags. It should be noted that a cognitive tag was required for each utterance, while a motivational/affective tag was applied only to the subset of utterances that communicated in that channel.

A text-based dialogue interface was incorporated into a learning environment for introductory computer science. In the environment, students undertook a programming task and conversed with human tutors while designing, implementing, and testing Java programs. The results of the study suggest that the choice of corrective tutorial strategy has a significant impact on the learning gains and self-efficacy of students. These findings reinforce those of other studies (e.g., Lepper et al. 1993, Person et al. 1995, Keller et al. 1983) that indicate that some cognitive and motivational goals may be at odds with one other because a tutorial strategy designed to maximize one set of goals (e.g., cognitive goals) can negatively impact the other. We contextualize our findings in light of recent results that learner characteristics such as self-efficacy influence the structure of task-oriented tutorial dialogue (Boyer et al. 2007), and may therefore produce important interaction effects when considered alongside tutorial strategy. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the</context>

The learning task was to complete a Java programming problem that required students to apply fundamental concepts such as iteration, modularization, and sequential-access data structures. This study was conducted to compare the impact of certain corrective cognitive and motivational tutorial strategies on student learning and self-efficacy in human-human tutoring. Specifically, the study considered the motivational strategies of praise and reassurance (Lepper et al. 1993) and the category of informational tutorial utterances termed cognitive feedback (Porayska-Pomsta et al. 2004, Tan and Biswas 2006) that followed questionable student problem-solving action. Following the approach of Forbes-Riley (2005) and others (Marineau et al. 2000), utterances from a corpus of human-human tutorial dialogues were annotated with dialogue acts. Then, adopting the approach proposed by Ohlsson et al. (2007), statistical modeling techniques were employed to quantify the relative impact of these different tutorial strategies on the outcomes of interest (in this case, learning an</context>

The study also found that, with regard to learning gains, purely cognitive feedback was preferable to cognitive feedback with an explicitly motivational component. These empirical findings are consistent with theories of Lepper et al. (1993) who found that some cognitive and affective goals in tutoring are “at odds.” As would be predicted, the results also echo recent quantitative results from other tutoring domains such as qualitative physics (Jackson et al. 2007) and river ecosystems (Tan and Biswas 2006) that, in general, overt motivational feedback contributes to motivation but cognitive feedback matters more for learning. Of the corrective tutorial strategies that were exhibited in the corpus, positive cognitive feedback emerged as an attractive approach for responding to plausibly incorrect student problemsolving actions.

While no single standardized dialogue act tag set has been identified for tutorial dialogue, the tags applied here were drawn from several schemes in the tutorial dialogue and broader dialogue literature. A coding scheme for tutorial dialogue in the domain of qualitative physics influenced the creation of the tag set (Forbes-Riley et al. 2005), as did the fourcategory scheme (Marineau et al. 2000). A more expansive general dialogue act tag set also contributed commonly occurring acts (Stolcke et al. 2000). The motivational tags were drawn from work by Lepper (1993) on motivational strategies of human tutors. Table 1 displays the cognitive subset of this dialogue act tag set, while Table 2 displays the motivational/affective tags. It should be noted that a cognitive tag was required for each utterance, while a motivational/affective tag was applied only to the subset of utterances that communicated in that channel.

The learning task was to complete a Java programming problem that required students to apply fundamental concepts such as iteration, modularization, and sequential-access data structures. This study was conducted to compare the impact of certain corrective cognitive and motivational tutorial strategies on student learning and self-efficacy in human-human tutoring. Specifically, the study considered the motivational strategies of praise and reassurance (Lepper et al. 1993) and the category of informational tutorial utterances termed cognitive feedback (Porayska-Pomsta et al. 2004, Tan and Biswas 2006) that followed questionable student problem-solving action. Following the approach of Forbes-Riley (2005) and others (Marineau et al. 2000), utterances from a corpus of human-human tutorial dialogues were annotated with dialogue acts. Then, adopting the approach proposed by Ohlsson et al. (2007), statistical modeling techniques were employed to quantify the relative impact of these different tutorial strategies on the outcomes of interest (in this case, learning and self-efficacy gains). 2.1 Experimental Design Subjects were students enrolled in an introductory computer science course and were</context>

The study also found that, with regard to learning gains, purely cognitive feedback was preferable to cognitive feedback with an explicitly motivational component. These empirical findings are consistent with theories of Lepper et al. (1993) who found that some cognitive and affective goals in tutoring are “at odds.” As would be predicted, the results also echo recent quantitative results from other tutoring domains such as qualitative physics (Jackson et al. 2007) and river ecosystems (Tan and Biswas 2006) that, in general, overt motivational feedback contributes to motivation but cognitive feedback matters more for learning. Of the corrective tutorial strategies that were exhibited in the corpus, positive cognitive feedback emerged as an attractive approach for responding to plausibly incorrect student problemsolving actions. Responding positively (e.g., “Right”) to questionable student actions is an example of indirect correction, which is recognized as a polite strategy (e.g., Porayska-Pomsta et al. 2004). A qualitative investigation of this phenomenon revealed that in the corpus, tutors gen</context>

Several directions for future work appear promising. First, it will be important to explore the influence of learner characteristics on tutorial dialogue in the presence of surface level information about students’ utterances. This line of investigation is of particular interest given recent results indicating that lexical cohesion in tutorial dialogue with low-performing students is found to be highly correlated with learning (Ward and Litman 2006). Second, while the work reported here has considered a limited set of motivational dialogue acts, namely praise and reassurance, future work should target an expanded set of affective dialogue acts to 59 facilitate continued exploration of motivational and affective phenomena in this context. Finally, the current results reflect human-human tutoring strategies that proved to be effective; however, it remains to be seen whether these same strategies can be successfully employed in tutorial dialogue systems.
