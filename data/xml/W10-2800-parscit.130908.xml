This volume includes the papers presented at the GEMS 2010 Workshop - Geometrical Models for
Natural Language Semantics, held on the 16th July 2010, jointly with the Conference of the Association
for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2010, and endorsed by SigLex and SigSem.
Distributional models and semantic spaces represent a core topic in contemporary computational
linguistics for their impact on advanced tasks and on other knowledge fields (such as social science
and the humanities). Semantic spaces based on simple contextual units have been early used in
information retrieval, showing dramatic impact on accuracy and scalability of many tasks. Later on,
more linguistically principled spaces have been introduced for large-scale natural language learning
problems, such as the acquisition of lexical taxonomies, word sense discrimination, pattern acquisition
and conceptual clustering. More recently, specialized distributional models have been successfully
applied to solve complex NLP tasks such as question answering, textual entailment and sentiment
analysis. Cutting-edge applications include the adoption of semantic spaces as models of rich lexical
semantic resources (e.g. lexical networks and lexicalized meaning theories, as frame semantics), and of
machine learning approaches based on kernel methods.
The GEMS 2010 Workshops builds on the successful first edition held in Athens in 2009 jointly with the
Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, which counted
more than 40 registered people and a large audience. As a follow-up of the GEMS 2009 Workshop, the
Special Issue of the Journal of Natural Engineering dedicated to “Distributional Lexical Semantics”1 is
a further proof of the high interest in this research area. The 2010 edition aims at consolidating GEMS’
contribution to the field, by stimulating research on semantic spaces and distributional methods for NLP,
by pushing for an interdisciplinary view, and by amplifying exchange of ideas, results and resources
among often independent communities.
The Workshop has successfully gathered high quality contributions to problems of meaning
representation, acquisition and use, including a total of 15 paper submissions. After a peer-review phase,
the program committee has selected 8 papers to be presented at the workshop, all of which have been
included in these proceedings. The papers are representative of the current state of the art in distributional
semantics, including:

<listItem confidence="0.99558025">
• cutting edge researches on geometric techniques and machine learning, such as tensor analysis,
non-linear embeddings, kernel methods, and latent topic models;
• applications of semantic space models to lexical acquisition tasks;
• novel optimization techniques for efficient and scalable distributional methods.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998987">
We would like to thank all the authors for the hard work dedicated to the submissions, and the members of
the program committee for their precious reviewing. A special thanks goes to Katrin Erk for her invited
contribution that provides a challenging and inspiring vision on the topic. Finally, we acknowledge the
ACL 2010 organization and mostly the workshop chairs, Pushpak Bhattacharyia and David Weir, for
their constant support across all the preparatory work.
