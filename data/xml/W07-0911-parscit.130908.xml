Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999089545454546">
The linguistic features of material in Cul-
tural Heritage (CH) archives may be in var-
ious languages requiring a facility for ef-
fective multilingual search. The specialised
language often associated with CH content
introduces problems for automatic transla-
tion to support search applications. The
MultiMatch project is focused on enabling
users to interact with CH content across
different media types and languages. We
present results from a MultiMatch study ex-
ploring various translation techniques for
the CH domain. Our experiments ex-
amine translation techniques for the En-
glish language CLEF 2006 Cross-Language
Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) task using Span-
ish, French and German queries. Re-
sults compare effectiveness of our query
translation against a monolingual baseline
and show improvement when combining a
domain-specific translation lexicon with a
standard machine translation system.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999634952380953">
Online Cultural Heritage (CH) content is being pro-
duced in many countries by organisations such as
national libraries, museums, galleries and audiovi-
sual archives. Additionally, there are increasing
amounts of CH relevant content available more gen-
erally on the World Wide Web. While some of this
material concerns national or regional content only
of local interest, much material relates to items in-
volving multiple nations and languages, for exam-
ple concerning events in Europe or Asia. In order to
gain a full understanding of such events, including
details contained in different collections and explor-
ing different cultural perspectives requires effective
multilingual search technologies. Facilitating search
of this type requires translation tools to cross the lan-
guage barrier between users and the available infor-
mation sources.
CH content encompasses various different media,
including of course text documents, images, videos,
and audio recordings. Search of text documents be-
tween languages forms the focus of cross-language
information retrieval (CLIR) research, while search
for images is the concern of content-based image re-
trieval. However, whatever the media of the items
they are accompanied by metadata. Such metadata
may include simple factual details such as date of
creation, but also descriptive details relating to the
contents of the item. Multilingual searching using
metadata content requires that either the metadata
be translated into a language with which the user is
able to search or that the search query be translated
into the language of the metadata. This alternative
of document or query translation is a well rehearsed
argument in CLIR, which has generally concerned
itself with full text document searching. However,
the features of metadata require a more careful anal-
ysis. Metadata is typically dense in search terms,
while lacking the linguistic structure and informa-
tion redundancy of full text documents. The absence
of linguistic structure makes precise translation of
content problematic, while the lack of redundancy
means that accurate translation of individual words

and phrases is vital to minimise mismatch between
query and document terms. Furthermore, CH con-
tent is typically in specialised domains requiring do-
main specific resources for accurate translation. De-
veloping reliable and robust approaches to transla-
tion for metadata search is thus an important com-
ponent of search for many CH archives.
The EU FP6 MultiMatch1 project is concerned
with information access for multimedia and multi-
lingual content for a range of European languages.
In the investigation reported in this paper we intro-
duce the first stage multilingual search functional-
ity of the MultiMatch system, and describe its use
in an investigation for multilingual metadata search.
Since at present we do not have a search test collec-
tion specifically developed for MultiMatch we use
data from the CLEF 2006 Cross-Language Speech
Retrieval (CL-SR) task for our experiments (Oard et
al., 2006).
The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows: Section 2 gives an overview of the MultiMatch
search architecture, Section 3 outlines the experi-
mental search task, Section 4 describes the trans-
lation resources used for this study, Section 5 and

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999414533333334">
The MultiMatch search system is centered on the
MILOS Multimedia Repository system (Amato et
al., 2004) which incorporates free-text search using
Lucene (Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2004) and im-
age search using an open source image retrieval sys-
tem GIFT (M¨uller et al., 2001). In order to support
multilingual searching a number of translation tools
are being developed based on standard online ma-
chine translation tools and dictionaries augmented
with domain-specific resources gathered from the
WWW and elsewhere. In this section we briefly in-
troduce the relevant details of MILOS and Lucene.
Since this paper focuses on text search within Mul-
tiMatch, we do not describe the multimedia features
of the MultiMatch system.

2.1 MILOS: Multimedia Repository
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999805363636364">
MILOS (Multimedia dIgital Library for On-line
Search) is a repository system conceived to support
the distributed storage and retrieval of multimedia
objects. This Multimedia Content Management Sys-
tem (MCMS) is able to manage not only structured
data, as in databases, but also textual data (using
information retrieval technologies), semi-structured
data (typically in XML), mixed-mode data, and mul-
timedia data. In MultiMatch, we use MILOS as a
metadata repository to enable querying on the struc-
ture of the data stored.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.902372272727273">
MILOS has a three-tier architecture composed of
three main components:
1. the XML Search Engine (XMLSE) component
which manages the metadata;
2. the MultiMedia Server (MMS) component
which manages the documents; and
3. the MultiMedia Digital Library service
(MMDLS) component MMDLS which pro-
vides application developers with a uniform
and integrated way of accessing MMS and
XMLSE.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.981479">
Each of these components is implemented using
solutions providing flexibility, scalability, and effi-
ciency.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.572659" genericHeader="method">
2.1.1 XMLSE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999830117647059">
XMLSE is an enhanced native XML
database/repository system with special features
for digital library applications. This is especially
justified by the well known and accepted advantages
of representing metadata as XML documents.
Metadata represented with XML can have arbitrary
complex structures, which allows it to handle with
complex metadata schemas, and can easily be
exported and imported. Our XML database can
store and retrieve any valid XML document. No
metadata schema or XML schema definition is
needed before inserting an XML document, except
optional index definitions for performance boosting.
Once an arbitrary XML document has been inserted
in the database it can be immediately retrieved using
XQuery. This allows digital library applications to
use arbitrary (XML encoded) metadata schemas
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992306">

<bodyText confidence="0.999988870967742">
and to deal with heterogeneous metadata, without
any constraint on schema design and/or overhead
due to metadata translation. Thus, the native XML
database/repository system is simpler than a general
purpose XML database system, but offers signif-
icant improvements in specific areas: it supports
standard XML query languages such as XPath and
XQuery, and offers advanced search and indexing
functionality on arbitrary XML documents. It
supports high performance search and retrieval on
heavily structured XML documents, relying on
specific index structures.
Moreover XMLSE provides the possibility of us-
ing particular indexes. For example, using the con-
figuration file of XMLSE the system administrator
can associate the &lt;abstract&gt; elements of a doc-
ument with a full-text index and to the MPEG-7
&lt;VisualDescriptor&gt; elements can be associated
with a similarity search index. XMLSE uses Apache
Lucene2 to provide partial (or approximate) text
string matching, effectively providing information
retrieval functionality within MILOS. This allows
XMLSE to use the ranked searching and wildcard
queries of Lucene to solve queries like “find all the
articles whose title contains the word XML” and
so on. This application allows users to interrogate
the dataset combining full text, and exact or partial
match search. For example the user can look for
documents whose &lt;metadata&gt; element contains the
word “Switzerland”. MILOS generates and submits
to XMLSE the following XQuery query:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.903920666666667">
for $a in /document where
$a//metadata ˜ ’Switzerland’

&lt;result&gt;

&lt;/result&gt;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999888666666667">
The query will return a list of results which con-
sist of the title and author of all documents whose
metadata contains the term “Switzerland”.

Full text search in MILOS is provided by using
Lucene as a plugin. Ranked retrieval uses the
standard tf x idf vector-space method provided in
Lucene (Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2004). Lucene
also provides additional functionality to improve re-

3 Evaluation Task

<bodyText confidence="0.99996847368421">
The MultiMatch system will enable search from a
number of CH repository sources including formally
published documents, images and video, as well
as material gathered from relevant WWW sources.
However, in order to explore metadata search is-
sues and evaluate our approaches to addressing re-
lated translation problems, a test collection includ-
ing sample user search topics and relevance judge-
ments is required. Since MultiMatch does not yet
have such a collection available, for our current ex-
periments we made use of the data provided for the
CLEF 2006 CL-SR track (Oard et al., 2006).
The document collection comprises 8104 En-
glish documents that are manually-determined
topically-coherent segments taken from 272 in-
terviews with Holocaust survivors, witnesses and
rescuers, totaling 589 hours of speech. Sev-
eral automatic speech recognition transcripts are
available for these interviews. However, for this
study we focus on the metadata fields provided
for each document: two sets of 20 automati-
cally assigned keywords (&lt;AUTOKEYWORD2004A1&gt;
and &lt;AUTOKEYWORD2004A2&gt;) determined using two
different kNN classifiers, denoted by AKW1 and
AKW2 respectively; a set of a varying number of
manually-assigned keywords (&lt;MANUALKEYWORD&gt;),
denoted by MKW; and a manual three-sentence
summary written by an expert in the field
(&lt;SUMMARY&gt;), denoted by SUMMARY.
The CLEF collection includes a set of 33 search
topics in standard TREC format created in English,
and translated into Czech, German, French, and
Spanish by native speakers. Since we wish to in-
vestigate topics with minimal redundancy, for our
experiments we used only the topic Title fields as
our search request. Relevance judgments were gen-
erated using a search guided procedure and standard
pooling methods were also provided with the collec-

tion. Full details of the this collection can be found
in (Oard et al., 2006; White et al., 2005).
To explore metadata field search, we used various
methods, described in the next section, to automati-
cally translate the French, German, and Spanish top-
ics into English3.

4 Translation Techniques
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99978975">
The MultiMatch translation resources are based on
the WorldLingo machine translation system aug-
mented with domain-specific dictionary resources
gathered automatically from the WWW. This section
briefly reviews WorldLingo4, and then describes
construction of our augmentation translation lexi-
cons and their application for query translation in
multilingual metadata search.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.972542">
4.1 Machine translation system
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976173913044">
There are a number of commercial machine transla-
tion systems currently available. After evaluation of
several candidate systems, WorldLingo was selected
for the MultiMatch project because it generally gives
good translation well between the English, Spanish,
Italian, and Dutch, languages relevant to the Mul-
timatch project5. In addition, it provides a useful
API that can be used to translate queries on the fly
via HTTP transfer protocol. The usefulness of such
a system is that it can be integrated into any appli-
cation and present translations in real-time. It al-
lows users to select the source/target languages and
specify the text format (e.g. plain text file or html
file) of their input files. The WorldLingo translation
system also provides various domain-specific dictio-
naries that can be integrated with translation system.
A particularly useful feature of WorldLingo with re-
spect to for MultiMatch, and potentially applications
within CH in general, is that to improve the qual-
ity of translations, additional locally developed cus-
tomized dictionaries can be uploaded. This enables
the WorldLingo dictionaries to be extended to con-
tain special terms for a specific domain.

4.2 Translation lexicon construction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983">
To extend the standard dictionaries provided with
WorldLingo we used the current online wikipedia.
Wikipedia6 is the largest multilingual free-content
encyclopedia on the Internet. As of March 21 2007,
there are approximately 6.8 million articles written
in 250 languages available on the web, according
to liki Stats7. Wikipedia is structured as an in-
terconnected network of articles. Each wikipedia
page can hyperlink to several other wikipedia pages.
Wikipedia page titles in one language are also linked
to a multilingual database of corresponding terms.
Unlike the web, most hyperlinks in wikipedia have
a more consistent and semantically meaningful in-
terpretation and purpose. The comprehensive liter-
ature review presented by Adafre and Rijke (2005)
describes the link structure of wikipedia. As a mul-
tilingual hypertext medium, wikipedia presents a
valuable new source of translation information. Re-
cently, researchers have proposed techniques to ex-
ploit this opportunity. Adafre and Rijke (2006) de-
veloped a technique to identify similar text across
multiple languages in wikipedia using page content-
based features. Boumaet et al. (2006) utilized
wikipedia for term recognition and translation in
order to enhance multilingual question answering
systems. Declerck et al. (2006) showed how the
wikipedia resource can be used to support the su-
pervised translation of ontology labels.
In order to improve the effectiveness of multilin-
gual metadata search, we mine wikipedia pages as
a translation source and construct translation lex-
icons that can be used to reduce the errors intro-
duced by unknown terms (single words and multi-
word phrases) during query translation. The major
difference in our proposal is that the translations are
extracted on the basis of hyperlinks, meta keywords,
and emphasized concepts — e.g. anchor text, bold-
face text, italics text, and text within special punc-
tuation marks — appearing in the first paragraph of
wikipedia articles.
Meta keywords Wikipedia pages typically contain
meta keywords assigned by page editors. This

Title Meta Emphasized
terms keywords concepts
Emphasized concepts In common with standard
summarization studies, we observed that the
first paragraph of a wikipedia document is usu-
ally a concise introduction to the article. Thus,
concepts emphasized in the introductory sec-
tion are likely to be semantically related to the
title of the page.
In our study we seek to use these features from
multilingual wikipedia pages to compile a domain-
specific word and phrase translation lexicon. Our
method in using this data is to augment the queries
with topically related terms in the document lan-
guage through a process of post-translation query
expansion. This procedure was performed as fol-
lows:

to pages and subcategories concerning events,
persons, places, and organizations pertaining
to war crimes or crimes against humanity es-
pecially during WWII. It should be noted that

this process was neither an exhaustive crawl
nor a focused crawl. The purpose of our cur-
rent study is to explore the effect of translation
expansion on metadata retrieval effectiveness.
In total, we collected 7431 English web pages.
2. For each English wikipedia page, we extracted
its hyperlinks to German, Spanish, and French.
The basename of each hyperlink is considered
as a term (single word or multi-word phrase
that should be translated as a unit). This pro-
vided a total of 4446 German terms, 3338
Spanish terms, and 4062 French terms. As an
alternative way of collecting terms in German,
Spanish, and French, we are able to crawl the
wikipedia in a specific language. However, a
page with no link pointing to its English coun-
terpart will not provide enough translation in-
formation.

3. For each of the German, Spanish, and French
terms obtained, we used the title term, the meta
keywords, and the emphasized concepts ob-
tained from the same English wikipedia page
as its potential translations.
For example, consider an English page titled as
“World War II”9. The title term, the meta keywords,
the emphasized concepts in English, and the hyper-
links (to German, Spanish, and French) associated
are shown in Figure 1. We first extract the base-
names “Zweiter Weltkrieg” (in German), “Segunda
Guerra Mundial” (in Spanish), and “Seconde Guerre
mondiale” (in French) using the hyperlink feature.
To translate these terms into English, we replace
them using the English title term, all the English
meta keywords and/or all the English emphasized
concepts occurring in the same English wikipedia
page. This is a straightforward approach to au-
tomatic post-translation query expansion by using
meta keywords and/or emphasized concepts as ex-
panded terms. The effects of the features described
above are investigated in this work, both separately
and in combination, as shown in Table 1,

for our multilingual results, we used the standard

then tested the MT integrated with different lexicons
compiled using wikipedia. Results of these experi-
ments, shown in Table 1, enable us gauge the effect
of each of our additional translation resources gen-
erated using wikipedia.

The focus of this paper is not on optimising ab-
solute retrieval performance, but rather to explore
the usefulness of our translation resources. Thus
we do not apply retrieval enhancement techniques
such as relevance feedback which would make it
more difficult to observe the impact of differences
in behaviour of the translation resources. The ex-
periments use the SUMMARY field, as an exam-
ple of concise natural language descriptions of CH
objects; and the AKW1 and AKW2 fields as exam-
ples of automatically assigned keyword labels with-
out linguistic structure, with the MKW field provid-
ing similar manually assigned for keyword labels.
Retrieval effectiveness is evaluated using standard
TREC mean average precision (MAP) and the pre-
cision at rank 10 (P@10).

6 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965324324324">
The results of our query translation experiments are
shown in Table 2, 3, 4, and 5. For search using SUM-
MARY and MKW fields, the lexicon compiled us-
ing title terms provided an improvement of 7 — 9%,
7 — 19%, and 20 — 30%, in German–English,
Spanish–English, and French–English retrieval task,
respectively. These improvements are statistically
significant at the 95% confidence level, and empha-
size the importance of a good domain-specific trans-
lation lexicon.
The addition of meta keywords or emphasized
concepts also improves results in most cases relative
to the RUNmt results. However, we can see that re-
trieval performance degrades when the query is ex-
panded to contain terms from both meta keywords
and emphasized concepts. This occurs despite the
fact that the additional terms are often closely re-
lated to the original query terms. While the addition
of all these terms generally produces an increase in
the number of retrieved documents, there is little or
no increase in the number of relevant documents re-
trieved, and the combination of the two sets of terms
in the queries leads on average to a slight reduce in
the rank of relevant documents.
The results show that RUNmt+t runs provide the
best results when averaged across a query set. How-
ever, when analysed at the level of individual queries
different combined translation resources are more
effective for different queries, examples of this ef-
fect are shown in Table 6. This suggests that it may
be possible to develop a more sophisticated transla-
tion expansion methods to select the best terms from
different lexicons. At the very least, it should be pos-
sible to use “context-sensitive filtering” and “com-
bination of evidence” (Smets, 1990) approaches to
improve the overall translation quality. We plan to
explore this method in further investigations.

can provide a statistically significant improvement
in the retrieval effectiveness. Using a tailored trans-
lation lexicon enables us to achieve (77%, 78%),
(86%,67%) and (75%,63%) of the monolingual ef-
fectiveness in German–English, Spanish–English,

MARY, MKW field search tasks. In addition, the
multilingual wikipedia proved to be a rich resource
of translations for domain-specific terms.
Intuitively, document translation is superior to
query translation. Documents provide more context
for resolving ambiguities (Oard, 1998) and the trans-
lation of source documents into all the languages
supported by the retrieval system effectively reduces
CLIR to a monolingual IR task. Furthermore, it has
the added advantage that document content is acces-
sible to users in their native languages. In our future
work, we will compare the effectiveness of these two
approaches to metadata search in a multilingual en-
vironment.

<abstract confidence="0.999709695652174">The linguistic features of material in Cultural Heritage (CH) archives may be in various languages requiring a facility for effective multilingual search. The specialised language often associated with CH content introduces problems for automatic translation to support search applications. The MultiMatch project is focused on enabling users to interact with CH content across different media types and languages. We present results from a MultiMatch study exploring various translation techniques for the CH domain. Our experiments examine translation techniques for the Enlanguage CLEF Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) task using Spanish, French and German queries. Results compare effectiveness of our query translation against a monolingual baseline and show improvement when combining a domain-specific translation lexicon with a standard machine translation system.</abstract>

The EU FP6 MultiMatch1 project is concerned with information access for multimedia and multilingual content for a range of European languages. In the investigation reported in this paper we introduce the first stage multilingual search functionality of the MultiMatch system, and describe its use in an investigation for multilingual metadata search. Since at present we do not have a search test collection specifically developed for MultiMatch we use data from the CLEF 2006 Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) task for our experiments (Oard et al., 2006). The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the MultiMatch search architecture, Section 3 outlines the experimental search task, Section 4 describes the translation resources used for this study, Section 5 and 6 concern our experimental setup and results, and finally Section 7 summarises our conclusions and gives details of our ongoing work. 2 MultiMatch Search System The MultiMatch search system is centered on the MILOS Multimedia Repository system (Amato et al., 2004) which incorporates free-text search using Lucene (Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2004) an</context>

However, in order to explore metadata search issues and evaluate our approaches to addressing related translation problems, a test collection including sample user search topics and relevance judgements is required. Since MultiMatch does not yet have such a collection available, for our current experiments we made use of the data provided for the CLEF 2006 CL-SR track (Oard et al., 2006). The document collection comprises 8104 English documents that are manually-determined topically-coherent segments taken from 272 interviews with Holocaust survivors, witnesses and rescuers, totaling 589 hours of speech. Several automatic speech recognition transcripts are available for these interviews. However, for this study we focus on the metadata fields provided for each document: two sets of 20 automatically assigned keywords (&lt;AUTOKEYWORD2004A1&gt; and &lt;AUTOKEYWORD2004A2&gt;) determined using two different kNN classifiers, denoted by AKW1 and AKW2 respectively; a set of a varying number of </context>

The CLEF collection includes a set of 33 search topics in standard TREC format created in English, and translated into Czech, German, French, and Spanish by native speakers. Since we wish to investigate topics with minimal redundancy, for our experiments we used only the topic Title fields as our search request. Relevance judgments were generated using a search guided procedure and standard pooling methods were also provided with the collec83 tion. Full details of the this collection can be found in (Oard et al., 2006; White et al., 2005). To explore metadata field search, we used various methods, described in the next section, to automatically translate the French, German, and Spanish topics into English3. 4 Translation Techniques The MultiMatch translation resources are based on the WorldLingo machine translation system augmented with domain-specific dictionary resources gathered automatically from the WWW. This section briefly reviews WorldLingo4, and then describes construction of our augmentation translation lexicons and their application for query translation in multilingual metadata search. 4.1 Mach</context>

The results show that RUNmt+t runs provide the best results when averaged across a query set. However, when analysed at the level of individual queries different combined translation resources are more effective for different queries, examples of this effect are shown in Table 6. This suggests that it may be possible to develop a more sophisticated translation expansion methods to select the best terms from different lexicons. At the very least, it should be possible to use “context-sensitive filtering” and “combination of evidence” (Smets, 1990) approaches to improve the overall translation quality. We plan to explore this method in further investigations. 7 Conclusion and Future Work This paper reports experiments with techniques developed for domain-specific lexicon construction to facilitate multilingual metadata search for a CH re86 RUN ID German–English Spanish–English French–English MAP P@10 MAP P@10 MAP P@10 RUNmt 0.0750 0.1233 0.0756 0.1250 0.0652 0.1152 RUNmt+t 0.0815 0.1516 0.0899 0.1545 0.0783 0.1333 RUNmt+m 0.0775 0.1266 0.0797 0.1364 0.0690 0.1030 RUNmt+c 0.0669 0.1000 0.0793 0.1303 0.0770 0.1152 RUNmt+m+c 0.0668 0.0968 </context>

The CLEF collection includes a set of 33 search topics in standard TREC format created in English, and translated into Czech, German, French, and Spanish by native speakers. Since we wish to investigate topics with minimal redundancy, for our experiments we used only the topic Title fields as our search request. Relevance judgments were generated using a search guided procedure and standard pooling methods were also provided with the collec83 tion. Full details of the this collection can be found in (Oard et al., 2006; White et al., 2005). To explore metadata field search, we used various methods, described in the next section, to automatically translate the French, German, and Spanish topics into English3. 4 Translation Techniques The MultiMatch translation resources are based on the WorldLingo machine translation system augmented with domain-specific dictionary resources gathered automatically from the WWW. This section briefly reviews WorldLingo4, and then describes construction of our augmentation translation lexicons and their application for query translation in multilingual metadata search. 4.1 Machine translation syste</context>
