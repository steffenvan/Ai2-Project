specifications and results of
UMCC_DLSI system, which was
involved in Semeval-2014 addressing two
subtasks of Semantic Textual Similarity
(STS, Task 10, for English and Spanish),
and one subtask of Cross-Level Semantic
Similarity (Task 3). As a supervised
system, it was provided by different types
of lexical and semantic features to train a
classifier which was used to decide the
correct answers for distinct subtasks.
These features were obtained applying the
Hungarian algorithm over a semantic
network to create semantic alignments
among words. Regarding the Spanish
subtask of Task 10 two runs were
submitted, where our Run2 was the best
ranked with a general correlation of 0.807.
However, for English subtask our best run
(Run1 of our 3 runs) reached 16th place of
38 of the official ranking, obtaining a
general correlation of 0.682. In terms of
Task 3, only addressing Paragraph to
Sentence subtask, our best run (Run1 of 2
runs) obtained a correlation value of 0.760
reaching 3rd place of 34.

sentences, documents). Thus, issues such as
disambiguation of meanings, detection of lexical
chains, establishing relationships between
documents, clustering, etc., require accurate
similarity measures.
The problem of formalizing and quantifying an
intuitive notion of similarity has a long history in
philosophy, psychology, artificial intelligence,
and through the years has followed many different
perspectives (Hirst, 2001). Recent research in the
field of Computational Linguistics has
emphasized the perspective of semantic relations
between two lexemes in a lexical resource, or its
inverse, semantic distance. The similarity of
sentences is a confidence score that reflects the
relationship between the meanings of two
sentences. This similarity has been addressed in
the literature with terminologies such as affinity,
proximity, distance, difference and divergence
(Jenhani, et al., 2007). The different applications
of text similarity have been separated into a group
of similarity tasks: between two long texts, for
document classification; between a short text with
a long text, for Web search; and between two short
texts, for paraphrase recognition, automatic
machine translation, etc. (Han, et al., 2013).
At present, the calculation of the similarity
between texts has been tackled from different
points of views. Some have opted for a single
measure to capture all the features of texts and
other models have been trained with various
measures to take text features separately. In this
work, we addressed the combination of several
measures using a Supervised Machine Learning
(SVM) approach. Moreover, we intend to
introduce a new approach to calculate textual
similarities using a knowledge-based system,
which is based on a set of cases composed by a
vector with values of several measures. We also
combined both approaches.

Below are listed the pre-processing steps
performed by our system. In bold we emphasize
some cases which were used in different tasks.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984849225806451">
• All brackets were removed.
• The abbreviations were expanded to their
respective meanings. It was applied using a
list of the most common abbreviations in
English, with 819 and Spanish with 473.
Phrases like “The G8” and “The Group of
Eight” are detected as identical.
• Deletion of hyphen to identify words
forms. For example, “well-studied” was
replaced by “well studied”. Example taken
from line 13 of MSRpar corpus in test set
of Semeval STS 2012 (Agirre, et al., 2012).
• The sentences were tokenized and POS-
tagged using Freeling 3.0 (Padró and
Stanilovsky, 2012).
• All contractions were expanded. For
example: n&apos;t, &apos;mand &apos;s. In the case of &apos;s was
replaced with “is” or “of”, “Tom&apos;s bad” to
“Tom is bad” and “Tom&apos;s child” by &amp;quot;Child
of Tom&amp;quot;. (Only for English tasks).
• Punctuation marks were removed from the
tokens except for the decimal point in
numbers.
• Stop words were removed. We used a list
of the most common stop words. (28 for
English and 48 for Spanish).
• The words were mapped to the most
common sense of WordNet 3.0. (Only for
Spanish task).
• A syntactic tree was built for every
sentence using Freeling 3.0.

3 Features Extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999600444444444">
Measures of semantic similarity have been
traditionally used between words or concepts, and
much less between text segments, (i.e. two or
more words). The emphasis on word to word
similarity is probably due to the availability of
resources that specifically encode relations
between words or concepts (e.g. WordNet)
(Mihalcea, et al., 2006). Following we describe
the similarity measures used in this approach.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99948">
3.1 Semantic Similarity of Words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999867428571429">
A relatively large number of word to word
similarity metrics have previously been proposed
in the literature, ranging from distance-oriented
measures computed on semantic networks, to
metrics based on models of distributional
similarity learned from large text collections
(Mihalcea, et al., 2006).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996097">
3.2 Corpus-based Measures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999836153846154">
Corpus-based measures of word semantic
similarity try to identify the degree of similarity
between words using information exclusively
derived from large corpora (Mihalcea, et al.,
2006). We considered one metric named Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer, et al., 1998).
Latent Semantic Analysis: The Latent
semantic analysis (LSA) is a corpus/document
based measure proposed by Landauer in 1998. In
LSA term co-occurrences in a corpus are captured
by means of a dimensionality reduction operated
by singular value decomposition (SVD) on the
term-by-document matrix 𝑇 representing the
corpus (Mihalcea, et al., 2006). There is a
variation of LSA called HAL (Hyperspace
Analog to Language) (Burgess, et al., 1998) that
is based on the co-occurrence of words in a
common context. The variation consists of
counting the number of occurrences in that two
words appear at n1 distance (called windows).
For the co-occurrence matrix of words we took
as core the UMBC WebBase corpus2 (Han, et al.,
2013), which is derived from the Stanford
WebBase project3. For the calculation of HAL
measure we used the Cosine Similarity between
the vectors for each pair of words.

3.3 Knowledge-based Measures

<bodyText confidence="0.987699428571429">
There are many measures developed to quantify
the degree of semantic relation between two
words senses using semantic network
information. For example:
Leacock &amp; Chodorow Similarity: The
Leacock &amp; Chodorow (LC) similarity is
determined as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.78138">
𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑙𝑐 = −log (𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ2∗𝐷 ) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9853321">
Where length is the length of the shortest path
between senses using node-counting and D is the
maximum depth of the taxonomy (Leacock and
Chodorow, 1998)
Wu and Palmer: The Wu and Palmer
similarity metric (Wup) measures the depth of two
given senses in the WordNet taxonomy, and the
depth of the least common subsumer (LCS), and
combine them into a similarity score (Wu and
Palmer, 1994):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.994707">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.961258666666667">
Resnik: The Resnik similarity (Res) returns
the information content (IC) of the LCS of two
senses:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.993239666666667">
𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑅𝑒𝑠 = 𝐼𝐶(𝐿𝐶𝑆) (3)

<bodyText confidence="0.987829285714286">
And P(c) is the probability of encountering an
instance of sense c in a large corpus (Resnik,
1995) (Mihalcea, et al., 2006).
Lin: The Lin similarity builds on Resnik’s
measure and adds a normalization factor
consisting of the information content of the two

Jiang &amp; Conrath: The Jiang and Conrath
similarity (JC) is defined as follows (Jiang and
Conrath, 1997):
𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ = −log 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑛(𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒1, 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒1)(7)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.875293">
Where 𝑝𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑙𝑒𝑛(𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒1, 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒1) is the
number of edges in the shortest path between
𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒1and 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒2.
Word Similarity: In order to calculate the
similarity between two words (WS) we used the
following expression:

<equation confidence="0.9985685">
𝑊𝑆(𝑤1, 𝑤2) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑠1 ∈ 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑠(𝑤1) 𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝑠1, 𝑠2)

3.6 Sentence Alignment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999825625">
In the recognition of texts’ similarities, several
methods of lexical alignment have been used and
can be appreciated by different point of views
(Brockett, 2007) (Dagan, et al., 2005). Glickman
(2006) used the measurement of the overleap
grade between bags of words as a form of
sentence alignment. Rada et al. (2006) made
reference to an all-for-all alignment, leaving open
the possibility when the same word of a sentence
is aligned with several sentences. For this task, we
used the Hungarian assignment algorithm as a
way to align two sentences (Kuhn, 1955). Using
that, the alignment cost between the sentences was
reduced. To increase the semantic possibilities we
used all word similarity metrics (including the two
word similarity models) as a function cost.

obtained a vector with all measures explained

important to remark that our system, using SVM

“Evaluation of compositional distributional

semantic relatedness and textual entailment”, due
to deadline issues. We compared our system
results with the final ranking of Task 1 and we

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998769">
In this paper we introduced a new framework for
recognizing Semantic Textual Similarity,
involving feature extraction for SVM model and a
knowledge-based system. We analyzed different
ways to estimate textual similarities applying this
framework. We can see in Table 3 that all runs
obtained encouraging results. Our best run was
first position of the ranking for task 10 (Spanish)
and other important positions were reached in the
others subtasks. According to our participation,
we used a SVM which works with features
extracted from six different strategies: String-
Based Similarity Measures, Semantic Similarity
Measures, Lexical-Semantic Alignment,
Statistical Similarity Measures and Semantic
Alignment. Finally, we can conclude that our
system achieved important results and it is able to
be applied on different scenarios, such as task 10,
task 3.1 and task 1. See Table 3 and the beginning
of Section 5.

<abstract confidence="0.97959875">In this paper we describe the specifications and results UMCC_DLSI system, which was involved in Semeval-2014 addressing two subtasks of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS, Task 10, for English and Spanish), and one subtask of Cross-Level Semantic Similarity (Task 3). As a supervised system, it was provided by different types of lexical and semantic features to train a classifier which was used to decide the correct answers for distinct subtasks. These features were obtained applying the Hungarian algorithm over a semantic network to create semantic alignments among words. Regarding the Spanish subtask of Task 10 two runs were submitted, where our Run2 was the best ranked with a general correlation of 0.807. However, for English subtask our best run of our 3 runs) reached place of 38 of the official ranking, obtaining a general correlation of 0.682. In terms of Task 3, only addressing Paragraph to Sentence subtask, our best run (Run1 of 2 runs) obtained a correlation value of 0.760 place of 34.</abstract>

In bold we emphasize some cases which were used in different tasks. • All brackets were removed. • The abbreviations were expanded to their respective meanings. It was applied using a list of the most common abbreviations in English, with 819 and Spanish with 473. Phrases like “The G8” and “The Group of Eight” are detected as identical. • Deletion of hyphen to identify words forms. For example, “well-studied” was replaced by “well studied”. Example taken from line 13 of MSRpar corpus in test set of Semeval STS 2012 (Agirre, et al., 2012). • The sentences were tokenized and POStagged using Freeling 3.0 (Padró and Stanilovsky, 2012). • All contractions were expanded.

Recent research in the field of Computational Linguistics has emphasized the perspective of semantic relations between two lexemes in a lexical resource, or its inverse, semantic distance. The similarity of sentences is a confidence score that reflects the relationship between the meanings of two sentences. This similarity has been addressed in the literature with terminologies such as affinity, proximity, distance, difference and divergence (Jenhani, et al., 2007). The different applications of text similarity have been separated into a group of similarity tasks: between two long texts, for document classification; between a short text with a long text, for Web search; and between two short texts, for paraphrase recognition, automatic machine translation, etc. (Han, et al., 2013). At present, the calculation of the similarity between texts has been tackled from different points of views. Some have opted for a single measure to capture all the features of texts and other models have been trained with various measures to take text features separately. In</context>

The emphasis on word to word similarity is probably due to the availability of resources that specifically encode relations between words or concepts (e.g. WordNet) (Mihalcea, et al., 2006). Following we describe the similarity measures used in this approach. 3.1 Semantic Similarity of Words A relatively large number of word to word similarity metrics have previously been proposed in the literature, ranging from distance-oriented measures computed on semantic networks, to metrics based on models of distributional similarity learned from large text collections (Mihalcea, et al., 2006). 3.2 Corpus-based Measures Corpus-based measures of word semantic similarity try to identify the degree of similarity between words using information exclusively derived from large corpora (Mihalcea</context>

It was applied using a list of the most common abbreviations in English, with 819 and Spanish with 473. Phrases like “The G8” and “The Group of Eight” are detected as identical. • Deletion of hyphen to identify words forms. For example, “well-studied” was replaced by “well studied”. Example taken from line 13 of MSRpar corpus in test set of Semeval STS 2012 (Agirre, et al., 2012). • The sentences were tokenized and POStagged using Freeling 3.0 (Padró and Stanilovsky, 2012). • All contractions were expanded. For example: n&apos;t, &apos;mand &apos;s. In the case of &apos;s was replaced with “is” or “of”, “Tom&apos;s bad” to “Tom is bad” and “Tom&apos;s child” by &amp;quot;Child of Tom&amp;quot;. (Only for English tasks). • Punctuation marks were removed from the tokens except for the decimal point in numbers. • Stop words were removed. We used a list of the most common stop words. (28 for English and 48 for Spanish). • The words were mapped to the most common sense of WordNet 3.0. (Only for Spanish task). • A syntactic tree was built for every sentence using Freeling 3.0. 1 The windows is the number of interm</context>
