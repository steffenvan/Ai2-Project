Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999866636363636">
When corporations, news media and ad-
vocacy organizations embrace networked
information technology, intentionally or
unintentionally, they influence democra-
tic processes. To capture and understand
the influence of publicly available elec-
tronic content, the US Election 2004 Web
Monitor1 tracked the online coverage of
US presidential candidates, and investi-
gated how this coverage reflected their
position on environmental issues.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954409090909">
Most attempts to monitor the campaign perfor-
mance of presidential candidates focus on public
opinion, which is influenced by the consumption
of media products. Analyzing patterns of politi-
cal communication, however, should include the
consumption as well as the production of content
(Howard 2003). Monitoring candidates&apos; coverage
on the Web provides a complementary source of
empirical data and window into the evolving
concept of electronic democracy (Dutton, El-
berse et al. 1999).
A recent Pew/Internet survey (Horrigan,
Garrett et al. 2004) found that four out of ten US
Internet users aged 18 or older accessed political
material during the 2004 presidential campaign,
up 50 percent from the 2000 campaign. For po-
litical news in general, more than two thirds of
American broadband users and over half the dial-
up users seek Web sites of national news organi-
zations. International news sites are the second
most popular category at 24 and 14 percent, re-
spectively.

As traditional media extend their dominant
position to the online world, analyzing their Web
sites should therefore reflect the majority of po-
litical content accessed by the average user.

2 Impact of New Media on Public
Opinion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974606060606">
Representative democracy offers significant pos-
sibilities for exploiting information networks
(Holmes 2002), but there is little agreement on
their specific impact. Proponents praise the net-
works’ potential to increase the accessibility of
information, encourage participatory decision-
making, and facilitate communication with pol-
icy officials and like-minded citizens. From an
advocate’s perspective, disseminating environ-
mental information via the Internet, directly or
through news media, creates awareness by em-
phasizing the interdependency of ecological, eco-
nomic, and social issues (Scharl 2004).
Critics portray McLuhan’s global village as a
“neofeudal manor with highly fortified and opu-
lent castles (centers of industrial, financial, and
media power) surrounded by vast hinterlands of
working peasants clamoring for survival and rec-
ognition” (Tehranian 1999, p55f.). They argue
that information networks polarize society by
linking groups with similar political views. Low-
overhead forms of personal publishing (Gruhl,
Guha et al. 2004) such as Web logs and online
discussion forums, for example, might reinforce
a group’s world view and shun opposing opin-
ions. This reinforcement, amplified by biased
media coverage, polarizes groups (Sunstein
2004) and degrades the climate of public dis-
course (Horrigan, Garrett et al. 2004).
The communication strategies of news media,
corporations and advocacy organizations affect
democratic processes. Yet they only condition,
rather than determine these processes. Assuming

<bodyText confidence="0.999882291666667">
deterministic effects of information networks
neglects the world’s ambivalence, and results in
conflicting claims regarding the networks’ politi-
cal impact. News media are free to choose which
candidate to emphasize, and how to interpret cur-
rent events (Wayne 2001). Most Americans pre-
fer unbiased news sources (Horrigan, Garrett et
al. 2004), but Web sites tend to reflect their own-
ers’ political agenda, and thus contribute to a
polarized electorate.
While a narrow margin decided the last two
US presidential elections, differences in the can-
didates’ positions became more pronounced in
2004, and the political deliberation more parti-
san. Partisans tend to perceive mass media con-
tent as biased against their point of view. Expla-
nations for this hostile media effect range from
selective recall (preferentially remembering hos-
tile content), selective categorization (perceiving
the same content differently) and conflicting
standards (considering hostile content as invalid
or irrelevant). Recent research suggests that se-
lective categorization best explains hostile media
effects (Schmitt, Gunther et al. 2004).

3 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999445128205128">
Given an increasingly polarized electorate and
hostile media effects that impair partisans’ judg-
ment, analyzing political Web content requires
objective measures of organizational bias. Yet
the volume and dynamic nature of Web docu-
ments complicate testing the assumption of or-
ganizational bias. To address this challenge, the
US Election 2004 Web Monitor sampled 1,153
Web sites in weekly intervals. The project drew
upon the Newslink.org, Kidon.com and ABYZ-
NewsLinks.com directories to compile a list of 42
US news organizations and 72 international sites
from four other English-speaking countries:
Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New
Zealand. To extend the study, the sample in-
cluded the Web sites of the Fortune 1000 (the
largest US corporations ranked by revenue) and
39 environmental organizations.
Considering the dynamics of Web content in
general and presidential campaigns in particular
(Howard 2003), a crawling agent mirrored these
Web sites by following their hierarchical struc-
ture until reaching 50 megabytes of textual data
for news media, and 10 megabytes for commer-
cial and advocacy sites. These limits help com-
pare sites of heterogeneous size, and reduce the
dilution of top-level information by content in
lower hierarchical levels (Scharl 2000).
Such a collection of recorded content used for
descriptive analysis is often referred to as corpus.
This research investigated and visualized regu-
larities in three groups of Web sites by applying
methods from corpus linguistics and textual sta-
tistics (Biber, Conrad et al. 1998; Lebart, Salem
et al. 1998; McEnery and Wilson 2001).
Quantitative textual analysis of Web docu-
ments necessitates three steps in order to yield a
useful machine-readable representation (Lebart,
Salem et al. 1998):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.858117625">
• The first step converts hypertext documents
into plain text – i.e., processing the gathered
data and eliminating markup code and script-
ing elements.
• The second step segments the textual chain
into minimal units by removing coding am-
biguities such as punctuation marks, the case
of letters, hyphens, or points in abbrevia-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.943297555555556">
tions. In the case of the Election Monitor,
this process yielded about half a million
documents each week, comprising about 125
million words in 10 million sentences. The
system then identified and removed redun-
dant segments such as headlines and news
summaries, whose appearance on multiple
pages distorts frequency counts.
• The third step, identification, groups identi-
cal units and counts their occurrences – i.e.,
creating an inventory of words, or multi-
word units of meaning (Danielsson 2004).
The frequency of candidate references pre-
sented in the following section is based on
such an exhaustive index, which often uses
decreasing frequency of occurrence as the
primary sorting criterion and lexicographic
order as the secondary criterion.

Frequency of References (Attention)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983214285714">
Media coverage and public recognition go hand-
in hand (Wayne 2001), documented by strong
correlations between the attention of news media
and both public salience and attitudes toward
presidential candidates (Kiousis and McCombs
2004). The US Election 2004 Web Monitor cal-
culated attention as the relative number of refer-
ences to a candidate. To determine references to
candidates or environmental topics, a pattern
matching algorithm considered common term
inflections while excluding ambiguous expres-
sions. Only identifying occurrences of george w.
bush, for example, ignores equally valid refer-
ences to president bush and george walker bush.

Yet a general query for bush fails to distin-
guish the president’s last name from references
to wilderness areas or woody perennial plants.
After the election, nearly two thirds of the me-
dia references mentioned George W. Bush and
Dick Cheney, up four percentage points from the
preceding week (Figure 1). About one third re-
ported on John Kerry and John Edwards. The
Fortune 1000 companies and environmental or-
ganizations dedicated over 80 percent of their
coverage to the president and his running mate.
Across all three samples, the independent team
of Ralph Nader and Peter Camejo garnered less
than five percent of the attention.

4 Semantic Orientation of References
(Attitude)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999858761904762">
Calculating the frequency of candidate refer-
ences disregards their context (Yi, Nasukawa et
al. 2003). Therefore, the system also tracked atti-
tude, the semantic orientation of a sentence to-
wards the candidates (Scharl, Pollach et al.
2003).
The algorithm calculated the distance between
the target word and 4,400 positive and negative
words from the General Inquirer’s tagged dic-
tionary (Stone, Dunphy et al. 1966). Reverse
lemmatization added about 3,000 terms to the
dictionary by considering plurals, gerund forms,
past tense suffixes and other syntactical varia-
tions (e.g. manipulate → manipulates, manipulat-
ing, manipulated).
Two sentences from news media on Novem-
ber 4 exemplify positive vs. negative coverage of
a topic (zero indicates neutral coverage). The
underlined words, identified in the tagged dic-
tionary, were used to compute the semantic ori-
entation of sentences with oil price references.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999106923076923">
• “US stocks rallied Wednesday, boosted by
shares of health and defence companies that
are seen benefiting from the re-election of
President George W. Bush, but higher oil
prices checked advances” (NEW ZEALAND
HERALD). ↑ (+ 4.09)
• “The dollar hit its lowest level in more than
eight months against the Euro Thursday, fal-
ling sharply on worries about the economic
effects of rising oil prices and expectations
of continued trade and budget deficits in
President Bush&apos;s second term” (ST. PETERS-
BURG TIMES). ↓ (– 4.03)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999173">
Initially, media coverage favored the Republi-
cans, although the Democratic contenders gained
ground in September 2004 (Figure 2). Kerry&apos;s
performance in the first televised debate acceler-
ated these gains in media attitude, followed by a
tight race between the two teams in the four
weeks preceding the election. The re-election of
George W. Bush again widened the gap, under-
standably considering the positive connotation of
terms such as winning and victory.

Compared to the news media, the other two
samples showed more bias. Fortune 1000 com-
panies presented the Republican candidates most
favorably, while environmental organizations
tended to criticize the environmental record of
George W. Bush – particularly abandoning the
Kyoto Treaty ratification, and reducing air pollu-
tion controls through the Clear Skies Act.
To investigate these claims, separate analyses
related environmental issues to Web sites and
candidates. In terms of energy policy, for exam-
ple, one such analysis investigated Web coverage
of renewable energy, fossil fuels and nuclear
power – a crucial aspect in light of recent geopo-
litical events and the global environmental im-
pact of US energy policy decisions. On a micro
level, the Election Monitor’s Web site allowed
users to list sentences containing both candidate
references and energy-related terms, and sort
these sentences by semantic orientation.

On a macro level, the perceptual map of
Figure 3 summarizes the prominence of energy
terms among international media sites. The dia-
gram is based on correspondence analysis, which
processed the table of term frequencies as of 17
September 2004. Related concepts and organiza-
tions appear close to each other in the computa-
tionally created two-dimensional space. The cir-
cular and rectangular markers represent energy-
related concepts and media sites, respectively.
When interpreting the diagram it is important to
note that term frequency, not media attitude, de-
termines the position of data points.
The distribution of data points shows a tripolar
structure: fossil fuels in the upper left, renewable
energies in the upper right, and nuclear energy
near the bottom of the diagram. The diagram il-
lustrates news organizations with distinct content
– Fox News and Time, for example, with their
coverage of nuclear energy and wind energy,
respectively. Geographic differences are also
apparent. Fossil fuels align with many Australian
media, reflecting the country’s richness in min-
eral resources. Most business publications con-
gregate around fossil fuels as well, Business
Week being a notable exception.
References to fuel cells and hydrogen often
appear together. Their potential use with various
energy sources explains their slightly isolated
position. Combining the energy carrier hydrogen
with fuel cell conversion technology yields high
efficiency and low pollution in applications such
as zero-emission vehicles, energy storage and
portable electronics.

5 Refining Attitude Measures
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896068181818">
Lexically identical occurrences with differing
or even opposite meanings, depending on the
context, represent an inherent problem of auto-
matically determining the semantic orientation of
Web content (Wilson, Wiebe et al. 2005). Word-
sense ambiguity, for example, is a common phe-
nomenon. Arrest as a noun takes custody by le-
gal authority, for example, while arrest as a verb
could mean to catch or to stop. Similarly, in eco-
nomics the noun good refers to physical objects
or services. As an adjective, good assigns desir-
able or positive qualities. Part of speech tagging
considers this variability by annotating Web con-
tent and distinguishing between nouns, verbs,
adjectives and other parts of speech.
Besides differences in word-sense, analysts
also encounter other types of ambiguities – e.g.,
idiomatic versus non-idiomatic term usage, or
various pragmatic ambiguities involving irony,
sarcasm, and metaphor (Wiebe, Wilson et al.
2005).
Given the considerable size of the corpus and
the need to publish results in weekly intervals,
the system was designed to maximize throughput
in terms of documents per second. A comparably
simple approach restricted to single words and
without sentence parsing ensured the timely
completion of the weekly calculations.
Planned extensions will add multiple-word
combinations to the tagged dictionary to discern
morphologically similar but semantically differ-
ent terms such as fuel cell and prison cell. Yet
the lexis of Web content only partially deter-
mines its semantic orientation, despite using
multi-word units of meaning instead of single
words or lemmas (Danielsson 2004). Prototypi-
cal implementations such as the OpinionFinder
(Wilson, Hoffmann et al. 2005) have demon-
strated that grammatical parsing can successfully
address this limitation by identifying ambiguities
and capturing meaning-making processes at lev-
els beyond lexis – correctly identifying, annotat-
ing and evaluating nested expressions of various
complexity (Wiebe, Wilson et al. 2005).

6 Keyword Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998866884615385">
Keyword Analysis locates words in a given
text and compares their frequency with a refer-
ence distribution from a usually larger corpus of
text. To complement measures of attention and
attitude towards a candidate, keywords grouped
by political party and geographic region high-
lighted issues associated with each candidate.
For that purpose, the system compared the term
frequencies in sentences mentioning a candidate
(target corpus) with the term frequencies in the
entire sample of 1,153 Web sites from media
organizations, the Fortune 1000, and environ-
mental organizations (reference corpus).
The results suggest that personalities and
campaign events dominate over substantive pol-
icy issues, a possible reason for the average
voter’s limited interest in and knowledge about
political processes (Wayne 2001). Table 1 sum-
marizes keywords that US news media associ-
ated with the presidential candidates and their
running mates in the week preceding the elec-
tion. The list ranks keywords by decreasing sig-
nificance, computed via a chi-square test with
Yates’ correction for continuity. To avoid out-
liers, the list only considers nouns with at least
100 occurrences in the reference corpus.

ton Cheney was busy, traveling to Pensacola,
Wyoming and Wilmington and addressing media
questions about his wife Lynne and his lesbian

cided voters of more prosperous times. At the
same time, actor Ashton Kutcher hit the cam-
paign trail for John Edwards, senator from North
Carolina and running mate of John Kerry.

didacy in Pennsylvania over invalid nominating

7 Conclusion and Future Research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990281632653">
The US Election 2004 Web Monitor provided a
weekly snapshot of international Web coverage,
measuring attention and attitude towards the US
presidential candidates. Keywords grouped by
political party and geographic region summarize
issues associated with each candidate.
Compared to the Web sites of news media,
campaign managers have less control of spin and
impact in media that rely on citizenry for mes-
sage turnover (Howard 2003). Extending the cur-
rent system will allow measuring information
propagation, not only among corporate Web sites
but also via Web logs, online discussion forums
and other forms of personal publishing. Investi-
gating the propagation of political content in
such environments requires large samples to
measure spatial effects, and frequent monitoring
to account for temporal effects.
For measuring information propagation, Gruhl
et al. (Gruhl, Guha et al. 2004) suggest distin-
guishing between internally driven, sustained
discussions (chatter) and externally induced
sharp rises in activity (spikes). Occasionally,
spikes result from chatter through resonance
when insignificant events trigger massive reac-
tions. Resonance occurs when individual interac-
tions generate large-scale, collective behavior,
often showing a sensitive dependence on initial
conditions. Social network analysis attempts to
explain such macroscopic propagation of infor-
mation between people, groups and organizations
(Kumar, Raghavan et al. 2002). By disseminat-
ing information via their social networks, indi-
viduals create strong peer influence that often
surpasses exogenous influences.
Efforts to create a more responsible electorate
(Dutton, Elberse et al. 1999) can leverage this
peer influence to trigger self-reinforcing content
propagation among individuals. Relationships
between these individuals determine the paths of
information dissemination. It is along these paths
that inter-individual communication multiplies
the impact of spikes and creates widespread at-
tention. Knowledge on the structure and deter-
minants of these paths could help promote issue-
oriented voting. This in turn would lead to a bet-
ter-informed electorate aware of its leadership
choices, and able to hold decision-makers ac-
countable.

Modeling the production, propagation and
consumption of political Web will help address
four research questions: How redundant is Web
content, and what technical and organizational
factors influence information flows within the
network? Can existing models of information
propagation such as hub-and-spoke, syndication
and peer-to-peer adequately explain these infor-
mation flows? How does Web content influence
public opinion, and what are appropriate meth-
ods to measure and model the extent, dynamics
and latency of this process? Finally, which con-
tent placement strategies increase the impact on
the target audience and support self-reinforcing
propagation among individuals?

The system then identified and removed redundant segments such as headlines and news summaries, whose appearance on multiple pages distorts frequency counts. • The third step, identification, groups identical units and counts their occurrences – i.e., creating an inventory of words, or multiword units of meaning (Danielsson 2004).

A comparably simple approach restricted to single words and without sentence parsing ensured the timely completion of the weekly calculations. Planned extensions will add multiple-word combinations to the tagged dictionary to discern morphologically similar but semantically different terms such as fuel cell and prison cell. Yet the lexis of Web content only partially determines its semantic orientation, despite using multi-word units of meaning instead of single words or lemmas (Danielsson 2004). Prototypical implementations such as the OpinionFinder (Wilson, Hoffmann et al. 2005) have demonstrated that grammatical parsing can successfully address this limitation by identifying ambiguities and capturing meaning-making processes at levels beyond lexis – correctly identifying, annotating and evaluating nested expressions of various complexity (Wiebe, Wilson et al. 2005). 6 Keyword Analysis Keyword Analysis locates words in a given text and compares their frequency with a reference distribution from a usually larger corpus of text.

To capture and understand the influence of publicly available electronic content, the US Election 2004 Web Monitor1 tracked the online coverage of US presidential candidates, and investigated how this coverage reflected their position on environmental issues. 1 Introduction Most attempts to monitor the campaign performance of presidential candidates focus on public opinion, which is influenced by the consumption of media products. Analyzing patterns of political communication, however, should include the consumption as well as the production of content (Howard 2003). Monitoring candidates&apos; coverage on the Web provides a complementary source of empirical data and window into the evolving concept of electronic democracy (Dutton, Elberse et al. 1999). A recent Pew/Internet survey (Horrigan, Garrett et al. 2004) found that four out of ten US Internet users aged 18 or older accessed political material during the 2004 presidential campaign, up 50 percent from the 2000 campaign. For political news in general, more than two thirds of American broadband users and over half the dialup users seek Web sites of national news organizations. International news sites ar</context>

The project drew upon the Newslink.org, Kidon.com and ABYZNewsLinks.com directories to compile a list of 42 US news organizations and 72 international sites from four other English-speaking countries: Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. To extend the study, the sample included the Web sites of the Fortune 1000 (the largest US corporations ranked by revenue) and 39 environmental organizations. Considering the dynamics of Web content in general and presidential campaigns in particular (Howard 2003), a crawling agent mirrored these Web sites by following their hierarchical structure until reaching 50 megabytes of textual data for news media, and 10 megabytes for commercial and advocacy sites. These limits help compare sites of heterogeneous size, and reduce the dilution of top-level information by content in lower hierarchical levels (Scharl 2000).

Keywords grouped by political party and geographic region summarize issues associated with each candidate. Compared to the Web sites of news media, campaign managers have less control of spin and impact in media that rely on citizenry for message turnover (Howard 2003). Extending the current system will allow measuring information propagation, not only among corporate Web sites but also via Web logs, online discussion forums and other forms of personal publishing. Investigating the propagation of political content in such environments requires large samples to measure spatial effects, and frequent monitoring to account for temporal effects. For measuring information propagation, Gruhl et al. (Gruhl, Guha et al. 2004) suggest distinguishing between internally driven, sustained discussions (chatter) and externally induced sharp rises in activity (spikes). Occ</context>

For that purpose, the system compared the term frequencies in sentences mentioning a candidate (target corpus) with the term frequencies in the entire sample of 1,153 Web sites from media organizations, the Fortune 1000, and environmental organizations (reference corpus). The results suggest that personalities and campaign events dominate over substantive policy issues, a possible reason for the average voter’s limited interest in and knowledge about political processes (Wayne 2001). Table 1 summarizes keywords that US news media associated with the presidential candidates and their running mates in the week preceding the election.
