1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999828179487179">
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the
problem of automatically deciding which sense a
word has in any particular context. The success
of any project in WSD is clearly tied to the
evaluation of WSD systems. SENSEVAL was
started in 1997, under the auspices of ACL-
SIGLEX, to bring together researchers to discuss
and solve the WSD-evaluation problem. Its aim
is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of
WSD algorithms and systems with respect to
different words, different varieties of language,
and different languages.
SENSEVAL is independent from other
evaluation programs in the language technology
community, such as TREC and MUC. Unlike
these programs, SENSEVAL is a &apos;freelance&apos;
program is run entirely by volunteers. We&apos;d like
to remind everyone that while SENSEVAL
takes the guise of a competition, its main
function is not to determine a winner but to
explore the scientific aspects of word sense
disambiguation.
SENSEVAL, held its first evaluation exercise
in the summer of 1998, culminating in a
workshop at Herstmonceux Castle, England on
September 2-4 (Kilgarriff and Palmer 2000).
Following the success of the first workshop,
SENSEVAL-2, supported by EURALEX,
ELSNET, EPSRC, and ELRA, was organized in
2000-2001. The Second International
Workshop on Evaluating Word Sense
Disambiguation Systems was held in
conjunction with ACL-2001 on July 5-6, 2001
in Toulouse.
This paper gives an overview of SENSEVAL-
2, discussing the evaluation exercise, the tasks,
the scoring system, and the results. It ends with
some recommendations for future evaluation
exercises.

<bodyText confidence="0.999232">
A main goal of SENSEVAL-2 was to encourage
new languages to participate. We were
successful: SENSEVAL-2 evaluated WSD
systems on three types of task on 12 languages
as follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.999664875">
In the all-words task, systems must tag almost
all of the content words in a sample of running
text. In the lexical sample task, we first
carefully select a sample of words from the
lexicon; systems must then tag several instances
of the sample words in short extracts of text.
The translation task (Japanese only) is a lexical
sample task in which word sense is defined
according to translation distinction. Task design
is discussed in section 3 below.
93 systems were submitted from 34 different
research teams. Table 1 gives a breakdown of
the number of submissions and teams who
participated in each task. Note that some teams
submitted multiple systems to the same task, and
some submitted systems to multiple tasks.

Several tasks had no submissions: the Chinese

complete the data in time for the exercise, and
the available Dutch data was misplaced in the
process of making it public. The Dutch data is
available, and the Chinese and Danish data will
be prepared in due course.

3 Task design
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999401851851852">
A task in SENSEVAL consists of three types of
data: 1) A lexicon of word-to-sense mappings,
with possibly extra information to explain,
define, or distinguish the senses (e.g., WordNet);
2) A corpus of manually tagged text or samples
of text that acts as the Gold Standard, and that is
split into an optional training corpus and test
corpus; and 3) An optional sense hierarchy or
sense grouping to allow for fine or coarse
gained sense distinctions to be used in scoring.
Regardless of the type of task, each system is
required to tag the words specified in the test
corpus with one or more tags in the lexicon.
Supervised systems can train on the training
corpus, if one is available.
The SENSEVAL committee issued general
guidelines for designing a task (Edmonds 2000).
But it was up to the individual task organisers, to
design their own tasks since each had different
constraints on resource availability (both human
and data). Everyone, however, used a common
XML data encoding format developed for
SENSEVAL-2.
Specific issues in choosing and designing the
resources for each task are described in the
papers in this proceedings, and, more generally,
by Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig (2000).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999835">
3.1 Lexicon and lexical samples
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999234375">
Each task organiser chose the lexicon for their
task. Notably, WordNet was used for the first
time in SENSEVAL. Version 1.7 for the
English tasks, and versions of EuroWordNet for
Spanish, Italian, and Estonian.
For the lexical sample tasks, the guidelines
suggests that words be chosen from different
parts of speech, different frequencies in the
corpus, and different polysemies (i.e., number of
senses). The number of words depended on the
available resources. The sample words were
kept secret from the wider community until the
training data was released; however, the
organisers consulted each other so that
translations of some of the sample words could
be used across tasks.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999942">
3.2 Tagged corpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976285714286">
For the all-words tasks, the guidelines suggest
that at least 5000 words of running text be
selected, and that all content words be tagged.
For the lexical sample tasks, it was suggested
that for each sample word, at least 75+15n
corpus instances be chosen, where n is the
number of senses of the word. Again, lack of
resources might have precluded this much
tagged data.
The Gold Standard corpus must be
replicable; the goal is to have human taggers
agree at least 90% of the time. Thus, at least
two human taggers were required to tag every
instance of a word. Taggers are allowed to tag
with multiple tags and to use special tags for
proper names, and unassignable senses. See the
papers in this proceedings for more details.
For the evaluation, the corpus had to be
divided into a training set and a test set. The
training set is a random subset of the Gold
Standard corpus, which allows supervised
systems to train. Not all tasks supplied training
data, so only &apos;unsupervised&apos; systems could
participate (e.g., in the English all-words task —
although many systems trained on other corpora
such as Semcor). The test set is the rest of the
corpus, with tags removed, on which the systems
would be evaluated. It was suggested that a 2:1
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.970362">
2
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984151">
ratio of training to test data be used. Although
somewhat different from what is normally used
in machine learning, the committee felt that
having more test data would give a more
realistic indication of a system&apos;s performance
(since more varied contexts per word would be
tested), and, moreover, unsupervised systems
would be less &apos;short-changed&apos;.
All data sets are now in the public domain (on
the SENSEVAL website).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999903">
3.3 Sense groupings
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971285714286">
Since some sense inventories are two fine-
grained for plausible sense disambiguation, the
scoring program can take into account sense
hierarchies or sense groupings. Optionally, a
task could provide such a grouping of senses, so
that choosing any sense within the group or
higher in the hierarchy would count towards a
system&apos;s overall score. For example, the
WordNet hierarchy was used for English nouns,
whereas a separate &apos;grouping&apos; was specially
constructed for the English verbs (since the
verbs do not have a useful hierarchy in WordNet
for scoring purposes). See the paper on the
English tasks for more detail.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999207">
3.4 Common data format
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988655172414">
All tasks used a specially defined common data
format for encoding the tagged and untagged
corpus examples. Specifically, it accommodated
the multi-lingual nature of the data by using an
XML document type definition which allowed
for a flexible mapping from lexical items to their
textual instances. Using XML also allowed for
arbitrary character encodings in the corpora.
The structure was designed so that individual
instances of lexical items could be associated
with multiple sense tags, and allowed for
discontinuous phrasal lexical items. It did not,
however allow for multiple phrasal items with
overlapping portions in the surface string.
Another requirement was simplicity. This
quality would not only facilitate the logistics of
designing a task, but would also ease any hand
annotation that may have been necessary. As a
result, a standoff annotation system was not
feasible. This restricted the format in such a way
as to limit the feasibility of embedding extant
annotation of the corpora and to require that
participants use standoff annotation in
submitting their answers for reasons of space
efficiency.
The use of the common data format simplified
many system&apos;s participation in multiple tasks,
consequently furthering research into the
comparison of WSD in different languages.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.86481" genericHeader="evaluation">
4 Evaluation procedure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9983036">
The evaluation was run centrally from a single
website at the University of Pennsylvania and
followed the same procedure as used in the first
SENSE VAL. For each task, data was released
in three stages:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997472166666667">
• Trial data: A small set of data so that
participants can design their systems to
use the data formats. No &apos;real&apos; data was
released.
• Training data.
• Test data.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997937625">
Each team would register their system, and then
download the data sets according to the
schedule. After running their system on the test
data, each team submitted their answers to the
website for automatic scoring. Each team&apos;s
results were returned to the team before the
workshop, but the overall results were unveiled
at the workshop.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99837">
4.1 Schedule
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999479375">
A schedule was set up for task organisers to
prepare and submit their data to the central
website, while participants followed a separate,
more rigid (and in the end very tight), schedule
for downloads and submissions.
Task organisers started preparing their data as
far back as September 2000, but the real push
occurred in the three months proceeding the
competition period.
The competition period ran April 17 — June 18.
Within this period, each task had a critical
window defined to be the period from when the
training data was first made available to the last
day for answer submissions to that task. The
critical window had to be a minimum of 21
days.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.704152">
Participants could download and submit
answers at any time during the critical window
of a particular task, subject to the following
constraints. A submission of answers must:
• not have occurred more than 7 days after
downloading the test data,

<page confidence="0.891243">

<listItem confidence="0.92708075">
• not have occurred more than 21 days
after downloading the training data, and
• have occurred before the end of the
critical window for the particular task
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911222222222">
This set up allowed participants to have
sufficient time to participate in several tasks
over the whole competition period, while
ensuring that on any particular task, a participant
had a maximum of one week to run their system
(and 3 weeks to train their system), which we
hope did not give any time for tailoring systems
to the specific words or the corpora of the
competition.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990342">
4.2 Data distribution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996652">
Data for the tasks was distributed via a website
at University of Pennsylvania. Participants were
required to register for tasks in order to
download the trial, training, and test data for the
tasks, and to upload their answers. Each of these
operations required authentication via a
password chosen at the time of registration.
Additionally, timestamps were recorded for each
of these operations in order to enforce the timing
constraints on a per-participant basis. The
system was not secure, as a participant could
register multiple times under different names
and use the data from the first registration to
perform the task at hand. However, there were
no signs of security problems in the use of the
website.
Use of the distribution center was
recommended, not required, of the task
organizers. All the tasks with the exception of
the Japanese tasks used the distribution center.
A nice by-product of this process in concert with
the common data format was the development
an overarching organization of all the
SENSEVAL data, which is evident in the data
available to the public domain.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998909">
4.3 Scoring and evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997085">
The same answer format and scoring program
was used for SENSEVAL-2 as was used in the
first SENSEVAL.
Systems were allowed to tag a word with as
many senses as appropriate, giving probabilities,
if desired. If the task had a sense hierarchy or
grouping, then fine- and coarse-grained scoring
was done. In fine-grained scoring, a system had
to give at least one of the Gold Standard senses.
In coarse-grained scoring, all senses in the
answer key and in system output are collapsed to
their highest parent or group identifier. For sense
hierarchies, mixed-gained scoring was also
done: a system is given partial credit for
choosing a sense that is a parent of the required
sense according to Melamed and Resnik&apos;s
(1997) scheme.
Systems were not required to tag all instances
of a word, or even all words, thus, as in
SENSEVAL-1, we used precision and recall to
score the systems, although the metrics are not
completely analogous to IR evaluation. Recall
(percentage of fight answers on all instances in
the test set) is the basic measurement of
accuracy in this task, because it shows how
many correct disambiguations the system
achieved overall. Precision (percentage of right
answers in the set of answered instances)
favours systems that are very accurate if only on
a small subset of cases that the system chose to
give answers to; the cases might be particularly
easy to disambiguate, but this can be determined
by comparing the answers to the baseline on the
same subset (a type of analysis that has yet to be
done). Coverage, the percentage of instances
that a system gives any answer to, is also
reported. Where available, baseline and inter-
tagger agreement numbers are given.
No further data analysis was done. Thus, the
question of who &apos;won&apos; depends on your
perspective, but, in fact, that is not the relevant
question. The important thing is to examine
how each system achieved the performance that
it shows. Some of this analysis is given in the
papers of this proceedings. (Note that in the
results, where appropriate, we distinguished
between supervised and unsupervised systems.)
When the results were unveiled at the
workshop, it soon became apparent that bugs in
the scoring software had potentially affected the
results. It was decided by everyone present (on
the first day) that all systems should be rescored.
Also, owing to the tight schedule, some teams
had made serious inadvertent errors in
formatting their answers. Thus, it was also
agreed that any team could resubmit their
(corrected) answers before 31 July 2001. In so
doing, the team would have to include an
explanation about the modifications and only
reasons of &apos;egregious&apos; bugs would be allowed.

The official results list all original submissions
scored with the debugged scorer, and all of the
resubmissions, clearly identified. This
compromise maintains the professionalism of
SENSEVAL, as it does not devalue any team
that met the original deadline, while encouraging
the scientific purpose of the exercise.
</bodyText>

5 Recommendations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990340909091">
Because the results were released so close to the
workshop, there had been no time for detailed
analysis. Thus, the workshop was structured
around a series of panels about WSD and
evaluation. Panels were held on domain-specific
disambiguation, task design for new languages
to SENSEVAL, sense distinctions, applications
of WSD, and standardizing WordNets.
Ideally, the majority of the workshop content
should have been about the analysis of WSD
algorithms, so the major recommendation for
future exercises is to allow at least one month
for analysis before the workshop. Part of this
recommendation is to have a proceedings at the
workshop, rather than post-workshop as this
one. A related recommendation is to gather
information about systems (e.g., supervised /
unsupervised, knowledge source, etc.) as they
are registered.
Second, the use of different granularities and
groupings for the lexicons in question yielded
some unnecessary inconsistency across tasks.
For example, the English tasks used a grouping
which invalidated the mixed-grained scores,
whereas the Swedish task used a hierarchy
which yielded vacuous coarse-grained scores.
This is actually a central issue in WSD, which
should be addressed before the next
SENSEVAL exercise. The data from
SENSEVAL-2 should be invaluable in this
research.
Finally, it was felt by some that the
SENSEVAL organization up to now has been
somewhat autocratic, which is true. This might
have been suitable in the past, but we would all
like SENSEVAL to become as open and
scientifically professional an activity as possible,
without sacrificing its grassroots quality.
Notably, its the only &apos;freelance evaluation
activity in the computational linguistics
community, and so we recommend that a more
democratic organization should be sought,
which should include an official executive
committee to oversee the future of SENSEVAL.
