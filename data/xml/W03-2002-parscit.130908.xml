Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998037254902">
The main area of this paper concerns the neural
methods for mapping scientific and technical
information (articles, patents) and for assisting a
user in carrying out the complex process of
analysing large quantities of such information.
In the procedure of information analysis, like in
the domain of patent analysis, the complexity of the
studied topics and the accuracy of the question to
be answered may often lead the analyst to partition
his reasoning into viewpoints. Most of the classical
information analysis tools can only manage an
analysis of the studied domain in a global way. The
information analysis tool that will be considered in
our study is the MultiSOM tool whose core model
represents a significant extension of the classical
Kohonen SOM neural model. The MultiSOM
neural-based tool introduces the concepts of
viewpoints and dynamics into the information
analysis with its multi-maps displays and its inter-
map communication process. The dynamic
information exchange between maps can be
exploited by an analyst in order to perform
cooperative deduction between several different
analyzes that have been performed on the same
data.
The paper demonstrates the efficiency of a
viewpoint-oriented-analysis as compared to a global
analysis in the domain of patents. Both objective
and subjective quality criteria are taken into
account for quality evaluation.
The experimental context of the paper is
constituted by a patent database of 1000 patents
related to oil engineering. The patents structure and
the patents field semantics are firstly exploited in
order to generate different viewpoints corresponding
to different areas of interest for the analysts. In the
experiment the selected viewpoints correspond to
uses, advantages, patentees, and titles subfields of
the patents. The indexing vocabulary of each
viewpoint is automatically extracted of its related
textual contents in the patents through a full text
analysis. The resulting vocabulary is then used to
rebuild patents descriptions regarding each
viewpoint. These descriptions are finally classified
through the unsupervised MultiSOM algorithm
resulting in as much different maps as viewpoints.
A fifth “global viewpoint” which represent the
combination of all the specific ones is also
considered in order to perform our comparison
between a global classification mechanism and a
pure viewpoint-oriented classification mechanism.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99951728">
The digital maps are not only tools of
visualization. They also represent an analysis tool.
Appropriate display of class points can give the
analyst an insight that it is impossible to get from
reading tables of output or simple summary
statistics. For some tasks, appropriate visualization
is the only tool needed to solve a problem or
confirm a hypothesis, even though we do not
usually think of maps as a kind of analysis, as for
patent analysis. There is many ways to create
digital maps. The one we consider here is based on
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANNs are a
useful class of models consisting of layers of nodes.
The power of ANNs is derived from their learning
capability defined as a change in the weight matrix
(N), which represents the strength of the links
among nodes. Moreover, both their relationships
with multivariate data analysis and their non-linear
capabilities represent added-values for classing and
mapping. The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM)
model is a specific kind of ANN which implements
in only one step the tasks of classing and mapping a
data set. In the SOM case, the learning is
competitive and unsupervised and the approach
gives central attention to spatial order in the
classing of data. The purpose is to compress
information by forming reduced representations of
the most relevant features, without loss of
information about their interrelationships. The main
advantages of the SOM model are its robustness
and its very good illustrative power. Conversely, the
fact that original model he his only able to deal with
one classification of the data at a time might be
considered as a serious bottleneck for exploiting it
for fine mining tasks.
In this article we shall be dealing with an
innovation that was firstly introduced for the
information retrieval purposes [13]. It has also been
successfully tested for multimedia mining and
browsing tasks, exploiting both the multi-map
concept and the synergy between images and text on
the same maps [14]. It is the multi-map extension of
the Kohonen SOM algorithm. This will be from
now signified by the name of MultiSOM. As we
shall notice, the MultiSOM introduces the concepts
of viewpoints and dynamics into the information
analysis concept with its multi-map displays and its
inter-map communication process. The dynamic
information exchange between maps can be
exploited by an analyst in order to perform
cooperative deduction between several different
analyzes that have been performed on the same
data. The principal intent of this article is to
propose the MultiSOM model as an ANN
implementation of the information analysis concept.
We will mainly focuses on the study of the
contribution of the viewpoint&apos;s oriented data
analysis proposed by the MultiSOM model as
compared to the global analysis proposed by the
other models. An attempt will be made to define a
protocol and to design a platform for this
comparison. As soon as the MultiSOM model can
be used either in a global way or in a viewpoint-
oriented way, it will be used as the reference model
for our comparison. The section 2 of the article
presents the Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM)
and their main applications in mapping of science
and technology. Sections 3 deals with MultiSOM,
the multi-map innovation of the SOM algorithm.
The context of the experiment on the oil engineering
patents and the preprocessing of these latter will be
described in the section 4. The Section 5 describes
the protocol of comparison which has been set up
along with its results. The conclusions are finally
exposed.

2. The self-organizing map (SOM)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999547742857143">
The basic principle of the SOM is that our
knowledge organization at higher levels is created
during learning by algorithms that promote self-
organization in an spatial order (see
[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[28]). Thus, the
architecture form of the SOM network is based on
the understanding that the representation of data
features might assume the form of a self-organizing
feature map that is geometrically organized as a
grid or lattice. In the pure form, the SOM defines
an &amp;quot;elastic net&amp;quot; of points (parameter, reference, or
codebook vectors) that are fitted to the input data
space to approximate its density function in an
ordered way. The algorithm takes thus a set of N-
dimensional objects as input and maps them onto
nodes of a two-dimensional grid, resulting in an
orderly feature map [9]. A layer of two-dimensional
array of competitive output nodes is used to form
the feature map. The lattice type of array can be
defined to be square, rectangular, hexagonal, or
even irregular. Every input is connected to every
output node via a variable connection weight. It is
the self-organizing property. The SOM belongs to
the category of the unsupervised competitive
learning networks [4],[11],[13]. It is called
competitive learning because there is a set of nodes
that compete with one another to become active. To
this category belongs also the adaptive resonance
theory (ART) model of Grossberg and Carpenter,
as well as the self-organizing maps discussed in this
paper. In the SOM, the competitive learning means
also that a number of nodes is comparing the same
input data with their internal parameters, and the
node with the best match (say, &amp;quot;winner&amp;quot;) is then
tuning itself to that input, in addition the best
matching node activates its topographical neighbors
in the network to take part in tuning to the same
input. More a node is distant from the winning node
the learning is weaker. It is also called unsupervised
learning because no information concerning the
correct classes is provided to the network during its
training. Like any unsupervised clustering method,
the SOM can be used to find classes in the input
data, and to identify an unknown data vector with
one of the classes. Moreover, the SOM represents
the results of its classing process in an ordered two-
dimensional space (R2). A mapping from a high-
dimensional data space Rn onto a two dimensional
lattice of nodes is thus defined. Such a mapping can
effectively be used to visualize metric ordering
relations of input data. As Kohonen [9] says: &amp;quot;The
main applications of the SOM are in the
visualization of complex data in a two dimensional
display, and creation of abstractions like in many
classing techniques.&amp;quot;
The SOM algorithm is presented in details in
([2],[9],[12],[13],[19]). It consists of two basic
procedures: (1) selecting a winning node and (2)
updating weights of the winning node and its
neighboring nodes. This preliminary learning phase
is not straightforward process [9]. It necessitates
several different learning steps, single map
evaluations, and comparisons between a lot of
generated maps in order to find at least a reliable
map, at most an optimal one [13],[32].
Let x(t) = {x,(t), x2(t),..., xN(t)} be the input
vector selected at time t, and Wk(t) = {Wk,(t),
Wk2(t),..., WkN(t)} the weights for node k at time t.
The smallest of the Euclidean distances ||x(t) –
Wk(t) ||can be made to define the winning node s:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.990955">
||x(t) – Ws(t) ||= min ||x(t) – Wk(t)||
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998185714285714">
After the winning node s thus selected, the
weights of s and the weights of the nodes in a
defined neighborhood (for example all nodes within
a square or a cycle around the winning node) are
adjusted so that similar input patterns are more
likely to select this node again. This is achieved
through the following computation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.870861">
Wki(t+1) = Wki(t) + ❑(t) • h(t) • [Xi(t) – Wki (t)],
for 1 ❑ i ❑ N
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976049180328">
where dt) is a gain term (0 ❑ ❑(t) ❑ 1) that
decreases in time and converges to 0, and h(t) is the
neighborhood function.
Once the SOM algorithm is achieved, the data
can be set to the nodes of the map. For each input
data vector, the winning node is selected according
to the algorithm first step presented above, and the
data are affected to this selected node.
In the quantitative studies of science, the
Kohonen self-organizing maps have been
successfully used for mapping scientific journal
networks [2], and also author co-citation data [33].
Maps have been also successfully used for several
other applications in the general area of data
analysis like for classifying meeting output [30], for
classing socio-economic data [32] and for
documentary database contents mapping and
browsing [13],14]. Kaski et al. have implemented a
specific adaptation of SOM, named WEBSOM, for
the analysis of important document collections [6].
WEBSOM main characteristic is to include
strategies for reducing the dimension of the entry
data descriptions by using random projection
techniques applied on word histograms extracted
from the document contents. WEBSOM method has
been tested for patents abstract analysis [7].
Nevertheless, as this method only manages such an
analysis in a global way, it can only provide the
analyst with general overview of the topics covered
by the patents along with their interactions. A more
exhaustive description of all the SOM applications
might be found in [32].
After the map building, the main characteristics
of the classes resulting from the topographical
classification process have to be highlighted to the
analyst in order to provide him an overview (i.e. a
global summary) of the analysis results. This task is
difficult because the profiles of the obtained classes
are mostly complex weighted combination of
indexes extracted from the data. We have
previously observed that single extraction strategy
like the one proposed by [17] could cause
shortcomings or mistakes in the interpretation of the
database contents. The first set of solutions we
proposed for solving this problem, like class
labeling and zoning strategies or generalization
mechanisms, are presented in [14]. Figure 3 of
section 4 presents a map resulting from these
processes.
In all the following sections, we will consider
that the classification process deals with electronic
documents associated with their description in the
form of index vectors. Classes will be represented
by node vectors or class profile; each component of
the vectors being the coordinate of a document
index element (keyword). The list of the input data,
which are the documents affected to the node, will
represent the “class members” profile. The
conceptual mean of the classes will be below called
a topic. This semantic information is supplied by
the classified keywords and documents.

3. The MultiSOM model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998502">
The communication between self-organizing
maps that has been first introduced in the context of
an information retrieval model [10], represents a
major amelioration of the basic Kohonen SOM
model. From a practical point of view, the multi-
map display introduces in the information analysis
the use of viewpoints. Each different viewpoint is
achieved in the form of map. Each map is a spatial
order in which the information is represented into
nodes (classes) and spatial areas (group of classes).
The multi-map enables a user to highlight semantic
relationships between different topics belonging to
different viewpoints. Each map represents a
particular viewpoint. Figure 4 of section 4
illustrates it.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999518">
3.1 The viewpoint paradigm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961">
The viewpoint building principle consists in
separating the description space of the documents
into different subspaces corresponding to different
keyword subsets. The set of V all possible
viewpoints issued from the description space D of a
document set can be defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9779605">
n
V = {v1, v2, ..., vn}, vi ∈ P(D), with v D
U i =
i=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977958333333">
where each vi represents a viewpoint and P(D)
represents the set of the parts of the description
space of the documents D; the union of the different
viewpoints constitutes the description space of the
documents.
The viewpoint subsets issued from V may be
overlapping ones. Moreover, they may also fit into
the structure of the document when they
correspond to different vocabulary subsets
associated to different documents subfields, if any.
Other viewpoints may be also manually extracted
from an overall document description space. At
last, the viewpoint model is flexible enough to
tolerate document descriptions belonging to
different media, as soon as these descriptions can
be implemented by description vectors (for ex. an
image can be simultaneously described both by a
keyword vector and by color histogram vector).
The inter-map communication mechanism,
which is described hereafter, takes directly benefit
of the above described viewpoint model in order to
overcome the low quality problem inherent to a
global classification approach while conserving a
overall view on the interaction between the data.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999224">
3.2 Inter-map communication mechanism
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.961988971428572">
In MultiSOM, this inter-map communication is
based on the use of the data that have been
projected onto the maps as intermediary nodes or
activity transmitters between maps. The
intercommunication process between maps operates
in three successive steps. Figure 1 shows
graphically the three steps of this
intercommunication mechanism.
At the step 1, the original activity is directly set up
by the user on the node or on the logical areas of a
source map through decisions represented by
different scalable modalities (full acceptance,
moderated acceptance, moderated rejection, full
rejection) directly associated to nodes activity
levels. This procedure can be interpreted as the
user’s choices to highlight (positively or negatively)
different topics representing his centers of interest
relatively to the viewpoint associated to the source
map. The original activity could also be indirectly
set up by the projection of a user’s query on the
nodes of a source map. The effect of this process
will then be to highlight the topics that are more or
less related to that query. The activity transmission
protocol, which corresponds to the steps 2 and 3 of
the inter-map communication mechanism, is
extensively described in [24].
easily verified if each vector used for the map
generation indexes a significant part of the
bibliographic database.
To perform in the best conditions, the inter-map
communication process obviously necessitates that
a significant part of the data should play that roles
between the maps. This last condition could be

nodes of one or several source map. [2] The activity is transmitted to the data nodes associated to the activated class
nodes of the source map. [3] The activity is transmitted through the data nodes to other maps to which these data are
associated. Positive as well as negative activity could be managed in the same process. Note that the data are in this
case indexed document.

In the two preceding sections we have introduced
MultiSOM after having previously presented the
SOM algorithm. In this section, we shall then use a
real example, to make some of the notions more
concrete. We argue that visualization into form of a
set of maps represents an important added-value for
analysis in the technology watching tasks, as well
as in science watch, and in knowledge discovery in
databases. Our example is a set of 1000 patents
about oil engineering technology recorded during
the year 1999.

4.1 The analysis phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99507425">
The role of the MultiSOM application has been
firstly planed by the domain expert in order to get
answers to such various kinds of questions on the
patents that:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986456090909091">
1: “Which are the relationships between the
patentees?”
2: “Which are the advantages of the different oils?”,
3: “Does a patentee works on a specific engineering
technology, for which advantage and for which
use?”,
4: “Which is the technology that is used by a given
patentee without being used by another one?”,
5: “Which are the main advantages of a specific oil
component and do this advantages have been
mentioned in all the patents using this component?”.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999672428571428">
An analysis carried out on all the possible types of
question led the expert to define different
viewpoints on the patents that could be associated
to different closed semantic domains appearing in
these questions. One of the main aim of the expert
was to be able to use each viewpoints separately in
order to get answers to domain closed questions
(like questions 1,2) while maintaining the possibility
of a multi-viewpoint communication in order to get
answers to multi-domain questions (like questions
3,4,5) that might also contain negation (like
question 4). The specific viewpoints which have
been highlighted by the expert from the set of
possible questions are:

<listItem confidence="0.9989828">

A fifth “global viewpoint” which represent the
combination of all the specific ones is also
considered in order to perform our comparison
between a global classification mechanism, of the
WEBSOM type, and a pure viewpoint-oriented
classification mechanism, of the MultiSOM type.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993041">
4.2 The technical realization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9944895">
The role of this phase consists in mapping the
four specific viewpoints highlighted by the domain
expert in the preceding phase in four different
maps. A preliminary task consists in obtaining the
index set (i.e. the vocabulary set) associated to each
viewpoint from the full text of the patents. This task
has been itself divided into three elementary steps.
At the step 1, the structure of the patent abstracts is
parsed in order to extract the subfields
corresponding to the Use and to the Advantages
viewpoints1. At the step 2, the rough index set of
each subfield is constructed by the use of a basic
computer-based indexing tool [4]. This tool extracts
terms and noun phrases from the subfield content
according to a normalized terminology and its
syntactical variations. It eliminates as well usual
language templates. At the step 3, the normalization
of the rough index set associated to each viewpoint
is performed by the domain expert in order to
obtain the final index sets. The normalization of the
Title, Use and Advantages subfields consists in
choosing a single representative among the terms or
noun phrases which represent the same concept (for
ex., “oil fabrication” and “oil engineering” noun
phrases will be both assimilated to the single “oil
engineering” noun phrase). The normalization of the
Patentees viewpoint is operated in the same way
considering that the same firm can appear with
different names in the set of published patents.
1 The Patentees and Title subfields are directly represented in the original
patent structure and therefore do not necessitate any extraction.
After the construction of the final index sets, the
patents are re-indexed separately for each viewpoint
thanks to these sets. Figure 2 presents a patent
abstract including its generated multi-index.
The following task consists in building the maps
representing the different viewpoints, using the map
algorithm described in section 2. Before these step,
a classical IDF-Normalization step [27] is applied
to the index vectors associated to the patents in
order to reduce the influence of the most
widespread terms of the indexes. For each specific
viewpoint a map of 10x10 nodes (classes) is finally
generated. Two global maps representing global
unsupervised classifications, of the WEBSOM type
[7], of the patents are also constructed. The index
sets of these maps represent the union of the index
sets of all the specific viewpoints. They only differ
one to another by the number of their classes. The
first one (GlobMin) is constrained to have the same
number of classes as the viewpoint maps (i.e. 100
classes). The second one (GlobMax) is constrained
to have to sum of the number of classes of all the
viewpoint maps (i.e. it becomes a 20x20 map
comprising 400 classes). The table 1 summarizes
the results of the patent indexation and the map
building. A single viewpoint map resulting from the
map building process is presented at the figure 4.
Some remarks must be made concerning the results
shown in table 1. (1) The index count of the Title
field is significantly higher than the other ones. An
analysis of the indexes shows that the information
contained in the patent titles is both sparser, of
higher diversity, and more precise than the ones
contained in the Use and Advantages fields.
Thanks to the expert opinion, the high level of
generality of the Use and Advantages fields, which
consequently led to poorer generated indexes, could
be explained as an obvious strategy of the Patentees
for indirectly protecting their patents. (2) The
number of final patentees (i.e. 32) has been
significantly reduced by the expert as compared to
the one initially generated by the computer-based
indexing tool. The main part of this reduction is not
due to variations in patentee names. It is related to
the fact that the prior goal of the study was to
consider the main companies and their
relationships. Thus, the patentees corresponding to
small companies have been grouped into a same
general index: “Divers”. (3) On the Patentees map,
the number of classes is close to the final number of
retained patentees. Most of these patentees will then
be associated to separate classes on the Patentees
map. (4) Only 62% of the patents have an
Advantages field and 75% a Use field.
Consequently, some of the patents will not be
indexed for the all the expected viewpoints. The role
of the mechanism of communication between
viewpoints (see next section) will then be to
generate indirect evaluation of the contents of these
patents on their missing viewpoints through their
associations with other patents.

Figure 2: Example of a patent abstract with its generated multi-index. The multi-index that has been generated
for the above patent abstract corresponds to the “Final indexation” field. The terms of the generated multi-index are
prefixed by the name of the viewpoint to which they are associated: “adv.” for the Advantages viewpoint, “titre.” for
the Title viewpoint, “use.” for the Use viewpoint, “soc.” for the Patentees viewpoint.

learning. After the learning, the nodes related to the same topics have been grouped into coherent areas thanks to the
topographic properties of the map. The number of nodes of each area can then be considered as a good indicator of
the topic weight in the database. Topics or areas near one to another represent related notions. For example, the
“extending oil live” area shares some of its borders with the “black sludge control” area on the map. The proximity
of these two areas illustrates the fact that oil duration strongly depends of maintaining a low level of sludge in it. The
surrounding circles represent the centers of gravity of the areas.

application let him interactively find that TONEN CORP. company is a specialist of the lubrication of the automatic
transmissions [arrow n°2 on the map] and that it adopted for this kind of lubrication sulfur-containing
organo-molybdenum compound [arrow n°1] whose main advantages are to provide oil with a friction coefficient that
is stable on a wide range of temperature [arrow n°3]. In this case, an inverted propagation from the target topics
should be also used to verify that these topics only belong to TONEN CORP. areas of competence. The whiter is the

4.3 Inter-map communication for analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989315789474">
In comparison with the standard mapping
methods, as such as principal component analysis,
multidimensional scaling or WEBSOM global
SOM analysis, the advantage of the multi-map
displays is the inter-map communication
mechanism that MultiSOM environment provides to
user. Each map is representing a viewpoint. Each
viewpoint is representing a subject category. The
inter-map communication mechanism assisted the
user to cross information between the different
viewpoints. In both cases, the responses of the
system are given both through activity profiles on
the maps and through patents examples associated
to the most active class representatives of these
maps. The estimation of the quality of thematic
deduction is achieved through an evaluation of the
activity focalization on the target maps (see [13]).
The figure 4 illustrates a thematic deduction
between the four different viewpoints of the study.

The advantages of the MultiSOM method seem
obvious to the expert of the domain: the original
multiple viewpoints classification approach of
MultiSOM tends to reduce the noise which is
inevitably generated in an overall classification
approach while increasing the flexibility and the
granularity of the analyses. Moreover, with a global
classification method, like WEBSOM, important
relationships between some subtopics are hidden in
the class profiles and therefore very difficult to
precisely characterize. The expert found more than
35 of such important relationships by the use of the
MultiSOM method. A simple example is given by
the comparison of the figure 3 and the figure 5.
Other examples of more elaborated topic
relationships that can be only obtained by the
MultiSOM inter-map communication mechanism
are given in the annex of the paper. Finally, the
expert argued that the possibility of interactively
activating, positively or negatively, the classes on
the maps represents a great help for tuning very
precisely an analysis process. Nevertheless, expert
empirical evaluation remains insufficient to
objectively compare global approach to viewpoint-
oriented approach. For this last purpose, we
propose new objective classification quality
estimators for both evaluating and optimising the
results of the classification and of the mapping
methods, especially when they are applied in the
domain of documentary databases. These estimators
are described in the next section.

5.1 Evaluation procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984264423728814">
When anyone aims at comparing classification
methods, he will be faced with the problem of
choice of reliable classification quality measures.
The classical evaluation measures for the quality of
a classification are based on the intra-class inertia
and the inter-class inertia [16][17][25]. Thanks to
these two measures, a classification is considered as
good if it possesses low intra-class inertia as
compared to its inter-class inertia. However, in the
case of a Kohonen classification, as well as for
many other numerical classification methods, these
measures are often strongly biased, mainly because
the intrinsic dimensions of the classes profiles
(number of non-zero components in the profiles) are
not of the same order of magnitude than the
intrinsic dimensions of the data profiles2. It is
especially true in the documentary domain where
the number of indexes in the documents is
extremely low as compared to the dimension of
their overall description space.
A promising way we have found in order to more
precisely highlight the main characteristics of the
classes of the map and to validate the thematic
deductions between the maps consists in coupling
the MultiSOM model with a symbolic model using
Galois lattice conceptual classification of the
patents regarding the same viewpoints as the one
used for the map building. This approach is
extensively described in [31]. A Galois lattice
model could also be considered as a pure natural
elementary classifier. Indeed, it groups the data by
directly considering their intrinsic properties (i.e.
without any preliminary construction of class
profiles). Hence, one might derive from its behavior
news class quality evaluation factors which can be
substituted to the measures of inertia for validating
the intrinsic properties of the numerical classes. For
the sake of user-orientation, our measures will be
based in a parallel way on the recall and precision
criteria which are extensively used from evaluating

process that tends to maintain the topographic properties of the map by
enhancing the similarities between neighboring classes.
the result quality of information retrieval (IR)
systems. In IR [29], the Recall R represents the
ratio between the number of relevant documents
which have been returned by an IR system for a
given query and the total number of relevant
documents which should have been found in the
documentary database. The Precision P represents
the ratio between the number of relevant documents
which have been returned by an IR system for a
given query and the total number of documents
returned for the said query. Recall and Precision
generally behave in an antagonist way: as Recall
increases, Precision decreases, and conversely. The
F function has thus been proposed in order to
highlight the best compromise between these two
values [35]. It is given by:

<bodyText confidence="0.990673428571429">
Based on the same principles, the Recall and
Precision measures which we introduce hereafter
evaluate the quality of a classification method by
measuring the relevance of its resulting class
content3 in terms of shared properties. In our further
descriptions, the class content is supposed to be
represented by documents and the indexes (i.e. the
properties) of the documents are supposed to be
weighted by values within the range[ 0,1] .
Let us consider a set of classes C resulting from a
classification method applied on a set of documents

Similarly to IR, the F-measure (described by
Eq. 1) could be used to combine Recall and
Precision results. Moreover, we have demonstrated
in [16] that if both values of Recall and Precision
reach the unity value, the peculiar set of class
C represents a Galois lattice. Therefore, the
combination of this two measures enables to
evaluate to what extent a numerical classification
model can be assimilated to a Galois lattice natural
classifier. The stability of our Quality criteria has
also been demonstrated in [16].

The examination of the Quality measures of the
table 2 gives more reliable and stable results
because these measures are both independent of the
classification method and of the size of the
description space. It highlights the overall
superiority of the viewpoint-oriented approach as
compared with a global approach with the same
number of class (GlobMin). As the number of
classes is strongly increased in the global approach
(GlobMax), its quality is simultaneously increased,
but the advantage of the viewpoint-oriented
approach remains obvious in the average (higher
Average F-value on all viewpoints than F-value of
GlobMax), with a more reasonable number of
classes per maps from a user point of view. The
specific case of the Title classification should be
discussed here. The bad quality of this classification
is both due to the index sparseness of this field4 and
to an inappropriate number of classes, relatively to

the size of its associated description space. An
interesting strategy would then be to make use of
the quality factor Q in order to find the optimal
number of classes for this classification. An
unbalance between Recall and Precision (in the
favour of Recall) can be observed in the case of the
worse classifications (GlobMin and Titles). Such
an unbalance means that documents with different
properties sets are grouped in the same classes,
leading conjointly to the risk of confusion in the
interpretation of the content of the classes by the
user.
The quality analysis clearly shows that the
viewpoint-oriented approach enhance the quality of
interpretation of a classification by both reducing
the number of class to be consulted by the user on
each viewpoint and providing him with more
coherent and exhaustive classes in terms of content.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999817">
5.3 Optimisation of classification results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996511">
The quality criteria that have been presented in
the latter section can also be used for optimizing the
number of classes for each viewpoint map. The goal
of this process is to provide the analyst with an
optimal quality of interpretation for each individual
map associated to a specific viewpoint. For that
purpose, different maps are generated from 6x6 to
24*24 nodes (classes) for each viewpoint. The
principle of our algorithm of classification
optimisation, which is described in [16], is to search
for a break-even point (i.e. intersection point)
between Recall and Precision. The map whose
quality criteria stand the nearest from the break-
even point is considered as the optimal one. The
figure subjectively illustrates the difference of
accuracy that can be obtained in the analysis by
optimizing the map size for a given viewpoint. As it
is shown in the figure 6, high quality maps are
usually characterized by more precise topic labels
and smaller average size of their logical areas.

surrounding of this topic is more precisely defined in the 16x16 map (optimal quality) than in the 11x11 map (lower
quality). Moreover, in the 11x11 map, the topic “machine oil” has been derived in a more fuzzy scope topic named
“machine and vehicles”.

6. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984684210526">
We have presented a new self-organizing multi-
map system. We proposed it as a visualization-
based system for scientific and technical
information analysis, like patents analysis. The
model that this multi-map environment provides is
certainly not the map but in its original extended
version of intercommunication between multiples
maps. Each map representing a particular viewpoint
extracted from the data. These viewpoints are
related either by the problem to be solved, or by the
intercommunication mechanism between the maps.
We have exposed both the map generation and their
intercommunication mechanism. We finally showed
how one can evaluate such a viewpoint-oriented
approach by comparing it to a global classification
approach.
The advantages of the MultiSOM method seem
obvious both in terms of objective evaluation, like
the one we proposed, and for the domain experts:
the original multiple viewpoints classification
approach of MultiSOM tends to reduce the noise
which is inevitably generated in an overall
classification approach while increasing the
flexibility and the granularity of the analyses.
Moreover, with a global classification method, even
if this latter manages overlapping classes, important
relationships between some subtopics are hidden in
the class profiles and therefore very difficult to
precisely characterize.
Our experiment has also highlighted that our
quality evaluation factors that we have proposed
can be benefitely used for optimizing the
classifications in terms of number of classes, either
these classifications are global or they are
viewpoint-oriented. This optimization seems to be
mandatory when one want to classify documents
issued from the Web, where sparseness could
usually be a blocking factor.

ANNEX: EXAMPLE OF DYNAMIC ANALYSIS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972693165289257">
Dynamic analysis takes place mainly by using
the inter-map communication mechanism which
makes it possible to bring to successful conclusion
sets of topics deductions between different
viewpoints chosen like investigation subfields. This
analysis is based on the generation of an initial
activity corresponding to the premises of the
deductions to check. According to the stage of
analysis, this activity can itself be generated
several manners by the analyst on one or more
source maps. If the activity generation is directly
operated by analyst on a map, it corresponds then
to a broad set of topics questions. If the activity
generation is operated indirectly by projection of a
query on a map or by activation of documents
group stored beforehand in a document collector,
it corresponds then to more targeted questions,
which can intervene in one advanced stage of the
analysis.
The analyst interest is to highlight the specific
areas of competence of the Exxon company. On
the simulation of analysis we develop on figure 7,
we will consider two different viewpoints, the
Patentees viewpoint which will represent the
source of the analysis and the Title viewpoint
which will represent its destination.
The analyst starts the process of deduction by
generating an initial activity on the main Exxon
topic (i.e. Exxon area gravity center) of the
Patentees viewpoint map. To obtain a broad set of
potential deductions, he selects the Possibilistic
mode of deduction [14]. The activity generated by
the inter-map communication mechanism on the
Title viewpoint map is focused in two different
zones of this map, corresponding to two potential
results.
In the first active zone (1), the analyst makes
use of two different naming strategies to facilitate
its interpretation, namely, a naming strategy
based on the profile of the topics (more generic)
and a naming strategy based on the profile of
the best members (i.e. patents) of the topics (more
specific). These operations enable him to highlight
that the Exxon company is specialized in a
correlative way on topics: “marine diesel
engine”, “surfactant system” and “basic
calcium compound”. The expert checks the
correlation between these topics by consulting the
patents associated to the topic “surfactant
system” (2). The title of the patents already
confirm him the problematic detected by the
application. A thorough examination of the
contents of the documents will show him than the
purpose of use of surfactant containing calcium in
addition with the normal formula of oils is to
protect the combustion chambers of the marine
diesel engines against corrosion due to the
absorption of air charged out of salt during their
operation. The problem of protection of the marine
engines against corrosion is sufficiently important
to represent a field of investigation for an oil
manufacturer like Exxon.
The construction of a query containing the single
descriptor “surfactant system” (3) on the Title
viewpoint will allow the analyst:
1. To validate the correlation between
“surfactant system” and “marine diesel engine”
topics which will be interpreted by the fact that
surfactant system” is only associated with
“marine diesel engine”.
2. To check the inverse deduction
“surfactant system Æ Exxon” which will insure
him that Exxon is the only company whose
interest in the conception of “surfactant system”.
The result of the projection of the query on the
Title viewpoint map (4) shows that the generated
activity is peculiar to the logical topic area
“marine diesel engine”, which confirms the first
assumption. Simultaneously with projection, the
documents that are relevant for the query are
presented in a Collector (5). The global activation
of these documents allows analyst to initiate a new
deduction. Then, the result of this latter can be
examined on the Patentees map. Like only the
main Exxon topic has been activated (6), the
second assumption of the analyst is confirmed.
The second active zone (7) generated by the
initial process of deduction will allow the analyst
to observe that the second major field of activity of
Exxon is the “biodegradable” oils. He will be
able to also note that these oils are more
specifically used for the lubrication of the two-
stroke engines (“two cycle engine”) that reject
generally much unburned oil. Probabilistic mode
of deduction will allow him to check if the inverse
deduction, namely, that Exxon is the only
company to be worked on biodegradable oils, can
be validated (8). This process will lead the analyst
to conclude that “biodegradable” oil
manufacturing is shared between Exxon and
Mobil companies (9), which are the most
important oil manufacturers.
A complementary use of negative activity setting
on the “two cycle engine” topic (10) will show
more precisely to the analyst that that Mobil
company mainly focuses on manufacturing of
biodegradable oils for “two stroke engines” and,
in a complementary way, that Mobil company only
focuses on manufacturing of biodegradable oils
for “four stroke engines” (11).
The simulation of analysis presented here above
shows clearly how the analyst can make use of the
MultiSOM functionalities in order to highlight all
the privileged activity fields of the Exxon
company starting from a patents database related
to engineering of oils. Main functionality is inter-
map communication. Multiple naming strategies,
generation of queries and collection of
intermediate results that have been implemented
complementary to inter-map communication also
play an important role in the analysis process.

<abstract confidence="0.999494346153846">The main area of this paper concerns the neural methods for mapping scientific and technical information (articles, patents) and for assisting a user in carrying out the complex process of analysing large quantities of such information. In the procedure of information analysis, like in the domain of patent analysis, the complexity of the studied topics and the accuracy of the question to be answered may often lead the analyst to partition his reasoning into viewpoints. Most of the classical information analysis tools can only manage an analysis of the studied domain in a global way. The information analysis tool that will be considered in our study is the MultiSOM tool whose core model represents a significant extension of the classical Kohonen SOM neural model. The MultiSOM neural-based tool introduces the concepts of viewpoints and dynamics into the information analysis with its multi-maps displays and its intermap communication process. The dynamic information exchange between maps can be exploited by an analyst in order to perform cooperative deduction between several different analyzes that have been performed on the same data. The paper demonstrates the efficiency of a viewpoint-oriented-analysis as compared to a global analysis in the domain of patents. Both objective and subjective quality criteria are taken into account for quality evaluation. The experimental context of the paper is constituted by a patent database of 1000 patents related to oil engineering. The patents structure and the patents field semantics are firstly exploited in order to generate different viewpoints corresponding to different areas of interest for the analysts. In the experiment the selected viewpoints correspond to uses, advantages, patentees, and titles subfields of the patents. The indexing vocabulary of each viewpoint is automatically extracted of its related textual contents in the patents through a full text analysis. The resulting vocabulary is then used to rebuild patents descriptions regarding each viewpoint. These descriptions are finally classified through the unsupervised MultiSOM algorithm resulting in as much different maps as viewpoints. A fifth “global viewpoint” which represent the combination of all the specific ones is also considered in order to perform our comparison between a global classification mechanism and a pure viewpoint-oriented classification mechanism.</abstract>

The algorithm takes thus a set of Ndimensional objects as input and maps them onto nodes of a two-dimensional grid, resulting in an orderly feature map [9]. A layer of two-dimensional array of competitive output nodes is used to form the feature map. The lattice type of array can be defined to be square, rectangular, hexagonal, or even irregular. Every input is connected to every output node via a variable connection weight. It is the self-organizing property. The SOM belongs to the category of the unsupervised competitive learning networks [4],[11],[13]. It is called competitive learning because there is a set of nodes that compete with one another to become active. To this category belongs also the adaptive resonance theory (ART) model of Grossberg and Carpenter, as well as the self-organizing maps discussed in this paper. In the SOM, the competitive learning means also that a number of nodes is comparing the same input data with their internal parameters, and the node with the best match (say, &amp;quot;winner&amp;quot;) is then tuning itself to that input, in addition the best matching node activates its topographical neighbors in the network to </context>

A preliminary task consists in obtaining the index set (i.e. the vocabulary set) associated to each viewpoint from the full text of the patents. This task has been itself divided into three elementary steps. At the step 1, the structure of the patent abstracts is parsed in order to extract the subfields corresponding to the Use and to the Advantages viewpoints1. At the step 2, the rough index set of each subfield is constructed by the use of a basic computer-based indexing tool [4]. This tool extracts terms and noun phrases from the subfield content according to a normalized terminology and its syntactical variations. It eliminates as well usual language templates. At the step 3, the normalization of the rough index set associated to each viewpoint is performed by the domain expert in order to obtain the final index sets. The normalization of the Title, Use and Advantages subfields consists in choosing a single representative among the terms or noun phrases which represent the same concept (for ex., “oil fabrication” and “oil engineering” noun phrases will be both assim</context>

The following task consists in building the maps representing the different viewpoints, using the map algorithm described in section 2. Before these step, a classical IDF-Normalization step [27] is applied to the index vectors associated to the patents in order to reduce the influence of the most widespread terms of the indexes. For each specific viewpoint a map of 10x10 nodes (classes) is finally generated. Two global maps representing global unsupervised classifications, of the WEBSOM type [7], of the patents are also constructed. The index sets of these maps represent the union of the index sets of all the specific viewpoints. They only differ one to another by the number of their classes. The first one (GlobMin) is constrained to have the same number of classes as the viewpoint maps (i.e. 100 classes). The second one (GlobMax) is constrained to have to sum of the number of classes of all the viewpoint maps (i.e. it becomes a 20x20 map comprising 400 classes).

Classes will be represented by node vectors or class profile; each component of the vectors being the coordinate of a document index element (keyword). The list of the input data, which are the documents affected to the node, will represent the “class members” profile. The conceptual mean of the classes will be below called a topic. This semantic information is supplied by the classified keywords and documents. 3. The MultiSOM model The communication between self-organizing maps that has been first introduced in the context of an information retrieval model [10], represents a major amelioration of the basic Kohonen SOM model. From a practical point of view, the multimap display introduces in the information analysis the use of viewpoints. Each different viewpoint is achieved in the form of map. Each map is a spatial order in which the information is represented into nodes (classes) and spatial areas (group of classes). The multi-map enables a user to highlight semantic relationships between different topics belonging to different viewpoints. Each map represents a particular viewpoint.

The context of the experiment on the oil engineering patents and the preprocessing of these latter will be described in the section 4. The Section 5 describes the protocol of comparison which has been set up along with its results. The conclusions are finally exposed. 2. The self-organizing map (SOM) The basic principle of the SOM is that our knowledge organization at higher levels is created during learning by algorithms that promote selforganization in an spatial order (see [5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[28]). Thus, the architecture form of the SOM network is based on the understanding that the representation of data features might assume the form of a self-organizing feature map that is geometrically organized as a grid or lattice. In the pure form, the SOM defines an &amp;quot;elastic net&amp;quot; of points (parameter, reference, or codebook vectors) that are fitted to the input data space to approximate its density function in an ordered way.

The algorithm takes thus a set of Ndimensional objects as input and maps them onto nodes of a two-dimensional grid, resulting in an orderly feature map [9]. A layer of two-dimensional array of competitive output nodes is used to form the feature map. The lattice type of array can be defined to be square, rectangular, hexagonal, or even irregular. Every input is connected to every output node via a variable connection weight. It is the self-organizing property. The SOM belongs to the category of the unsupervised competitive learning networks [4],[11],[13]. It is called competitive learning because there is a set of nodes that compete with one another to become active. To this category belongs also the adaptive resonance theory (ART) model of Grossberg and Carpenter, as well as the self-organizing maps discussed in this paper. In the SOM, the competitive learning means also that a number of nodes is comparing the same input data with their internal parameters, and the node with the best match (say, &amp;quot;winner&amp;quot;) is then tuning itself to that input, in addition the best matching node activates its topographical neighbors in the network to take part </context>

For each input data vector, the winning node is selected according to the algorithm first step presented above, and the data are affected to this selected node. In the quantitative studies of science, the Kohonen self-organizing maps have been successfully used for mapping scientific journal networks [2], and also author co-citation data [33]. Maps have been also successfully used for several other applications in the general area of data analysis like for classifying meeting output [30], for classing socio-economic data [32] and for documentary database contents mapping and browsing [13],14]. Kaski et al. have implemented a specific adaptation of SOM, named WEBSOM, for the analysis of important document collections [6]. WEBSOM main characteristic is to include strategies for reducing the dimension of the entry data descriptions by using random projection techniques applied on word histograms extracted from the document contents. WEBSOM method has been tested for patents abstract analysis [7]. Nevertheless, as this method only manages such an analysis in a global way, it can only provide the analyst with general overview of the topics covered by the patents along with their in</context>

Each viewpoint is representing a subject category. The inter-map communication mechanism assisted the user to cross information between the different viewpoints. In both cases, the responses of the system are given both through activity profiles on the maps and through patents examples associated to the most active class representatives of these maps. The estimation of the quality of thematic deduction is achieved through an evaluation of the activity focalization on the target maps (see [13]). The figure 4 illustrates a thematic deduction between the four different viewpoints of the study. 5. Evaluation The advantages of the MultiSOM method seem obvious to the expert of the domain: the original multiple viewpoints classification approach of MultiSOM tends to reduce the noise which is inevitably generated in an overall classification approach while increasing the flexibility and the granularity of the analyses. Moreover, with a global classification method, like WEBSOM, important relationships between some subtopics are hidden in the class profiles and therefore very difficult to </context>

The classical evaluation measures for the quality of a classification are based on the intra-class inertia and the inter-class inertia [16][17][25]. Thanks to these two measures, a classification is considered as good if it possesses low intra-class inertia as compared to its inter-class inertia. However, in the case of a Kohonen classification, as well as for many other numerical classification methods, these measures are often strongly biased, mainly because the intrinsic dimensions of the classes profiles (number of non-zero components in the profiles) are not of the same order of magnitude than the intrinsic dimensions of the data profiles2.

Similarly to IR, the F-measure (described by Eq. 1) could be used to combine Recall and Precision results. Moreover, we have demonstrated in [16] that if both values of Recall and Precision reach the unity value, the peculiar set of class C represents a Galois lattice. Therefore, the combination of this two measures enables to evaluate to what extent a numerical classification model can be assimilated to a Galois lattice natural classifier.

The goal of this process is to provide the analyst with an optimal quality of interpretation for each individual map associated to a specific viewpoint. For that purpose, different maps are generated from 6x6 to 24*24 nodes (classes) for each viewpoint. The principle of our algorithm of classification optimisation, which is described in [16], is to search for a break-even point (i.e. intersection point) between Recall and Precision. The map whose quality criteria stand the nearest from the breakeven point is considered as the optimal one. The figure subjectively illustrates the difference of accuracy that can be obtained in the analysis by optimizing the map size for a given viewpoint. As it is shown in the figure 6, high quality maps are usually characterized by more precise topic labels and smaller average size of their logical areas.

After the construction of the final index sets, the patents are re-indexed separately for each viewpoint thanks to these sets. Figure 2 presents a patent abstract including its generated multi-index. The following task consists in building the maps representing the different viewpoints, using the map algorithm described in section 2. Before these step, a classical IDF-Normalization step [27] is applied to the index vectors associated to the patents in order to reduce the influence of the most widespread terms of the indexes. For each specific viewpoint a map of 10x10 nodes (classes) is finally generated. Two global maps representing global unsupervised classifications, of the WEBSOM type [7], of the patents are also constructed. The index sets of these maps represent the union of the index sets of all the specific viewpoints. They only differ one to another by the number of their classes. The first one (GlobMin) is constrained to have the same number of classes as the viewpoint m</context>

The context of the experiment on the oil engineering patents and the preprocessing of these latter will be described in the section 4. The Section 5 describes the protocol of comparison which has been set up along with its results. The conclusions are finally exposed. 2. The self-organizing map (SOM) The basic principle of the SOM is that our knowledge organization at higher levels is created during learning by algorithms that promote selforganization in an spatial order (see [5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[28]). Thus, the architecture form of the SOM network is based on the understanding that the representation of data features might assume the form of a self-organizing feature map that is geometrically organized as a grid or lattice. In the pure form, the SOM defines an &amp;quot;elastic net&amp;quot; of points (parameter, reference, or codebook vectors) that are fitted to the input data space to approximate its density function in an ordered way. The algorithm takes thus a set of Ndimensional objects as input and maps them onto nodes of a two-dimensional grid, resulting in an orderly feature map [9]. A layer of tw</context>

It is especially true in the documentary domain where the number of indexes in the documents is extremely low as compared to the dimension of their overall description space. A promising way we have found in order to more precisely highlight the main characteristics of the classes of the map and to validate the thematic deductions between the maps consists in coupling the MultiSOM model with a symbolic model using Galois lattice conceptual classification of the patents regarding the same viewpoints as the one used for the map building. This approach is extensively described in [31]. A Galois lattice model could also be considered as a pure natural elementary classifier. Indeed, it groups the data by directly considering their intrinsic properties (i.e. without any preliminary construction of class profiles). Hence, one might derive from its behavior news class quality evaluation factors which can be substituted to the measures of inertia for validating the intrinsic properties of the numerical classes. For the sake of user-orientation, our measures will be based in a parallel way on the recall and precision criteria which are extensively used from evaluating 2 In the SO</context>

It consists of two basic procedures: (1) selecting a winning node and (2) updating weights of the winning node and its neighboring nodes. This preliminary learning phase is not straightforward process [9]. It necessitates several different learning steps, single map evaluations, and comparisons between a lot of generated maps in order to find at least a reliable map, at most an optimal one [13],[32]. Let x(t) = {x,(t), x2(t),..., xN(t)} be the input vector selected at time t, and Wk(t) = {Wk,(t), Wk2(t),..., WkN(t)} the weights for node k at time t. The smallest of the Euclidean distances ||x(t) – Wk(t) ||can be made to define the winning node s: ||x(t) – Ws(t) ||= min ||x(t) – Wk(t)|| After the winning node s thus selected, the weights of s and the weights of the nodes in a defined neighborhood (for example all nodes within a square or a cycle around the winning node) are adjusted so that similar input patterns are more likely to select this node again.
