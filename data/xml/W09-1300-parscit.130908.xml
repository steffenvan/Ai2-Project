1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976112">
Yearly BioNLP workshops have been
held in conjunction with Association for
Computational Linguistics and North American
Association for Computational Linguistics
conferences since 2002. Whereas other
venues, such as NLP sessions at biomedical
informatics and computational biology meetings,
provide excellent opportunities for presenting
applications of NLP in the biomedical domain,
the ACL BioNLP workshop has become the
venue that is most characterized by representation
of work in a wide variety of areas of NLP. The
BioNLP workshop has consistently been a venue
for presenting work that is innovative, novel,
and challenging from an NLP perspective. In
addition to providing a venue for fundamental
BioNLP research, this workshop exposes
BioNLP researchers to the latest achievements in
other NLP areas and facilitates dissemination of
knowledge acquired in the BioNLP domain to
the wider NLP community.
Compared to previous years, BioNLP 2009
was novel in two ways. The first is that
it is the first workshop since formation of
the SIGBIOMED Association for Computational
Linguistics Special Interest Group. The second
is that for the first time, there was a shared task
associated with the workshop. This shared task is
documented in a separate proceedings volume.
The workshop received 29 submissions, of
which twelve were accepted as full papers
and an additional twelve were accepted as
posters. A number of themes were evident
in this year’s papers and posters. Lexical
semantics was especially well-represented this
year, with papers on ontology selection [10],
lexicon construction [12], and synonymy [3].
Information extraction was also well-represented,
with papers in this area tackling both the
genomic [2, 8], and the clinical [1] domain. This
included work that is novel in the biomedical
domain in terms of dealing with speech and
with the dental domain [1]. This year
also saw continued work on contextual issues
in biomedical text mining [6, 7]. Finally,
the program was rounded out with work
on a new formulation of the named entity
recognition problem [11], the hot topic of
species identification [5], and word sense
disambiguation [9] and summarization [4].

The greatest debt owed by the organizers of
a workshop like this is to the authors who
graciously chose BioNLP 2009 as the venue in
which to share the fruits of the countless hours
of research that went into the work submitted
for consideration. The next-biggest debt is,
without question, to the many program committee

produced three reviews per paper on a tight
review schedule and with an admirable level of
