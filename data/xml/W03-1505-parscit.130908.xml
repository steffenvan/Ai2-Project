Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9994465">
In this paper we describe an experiment to
adapt a named entity recognition system from
English to Cebuano as part of the TIDES sur-
prise language program. With 4 person-days of
effort, and with no previous knowledge of which
language would be involved, no knowledge of
the language in question once it was announced,
and no training data available, we adapted the
ANNIE system for Cebuano and achieved an F-
measure of 77.5%.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983145571428571">
The TIDES Surprise Language Exercise is a
collaborative effort between a number of sites
to develop resources and tools for various lan-
guage engineering tasks on a surprise language.
Within a month of the language being an-
nounced, resources must be collected and tools
developed for tasks such as Information Extrac-
tion (IE), Machine Translation (MT), Summari-
sation and Cross-Language Information Re-
trieval (CLIR). The aim is to establish how
quickly the NLP community could build such
tools in the event of a national emergency such
as a terrorist attack.
A dry run for the exercise took place for 10
days during March 2003, in order to see how fea-
sible such tasks would be, how quickly the nec-
essary data could be collected, and to test out
the best working practices for communication
and collaboration between participating sites.
The language chosen for the dry run was Ce-
buano, which is spoken by 24% of the popula-
tion in the Philippines, and is the lingua franca
of the South Philippines. Twenty four hours be-
fore the language was announced, a bomb had
exploded in Davao City (the second largest city
in the Philippines), and the event classified by
the President of the Philippines as a terrorist
attack.

1.1 The Cebuano Language
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99922468">
The Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) at the
University of Pennsylvania had previously con-
ducted a survey of the largest 300 languages
(by population), in order to establish what re-
sources were available for each language and
which languages would be potentially feasible.
Their categorisation&apos; includes factors such as
whether they could find dictionaries, newspaper
texts, a copy of the Bible, etc. on the Internet,
and whether the language has its words sepa-
rated in writing, simple punctuation, orthogra-
phy and morphology, and so on. According to
this categorisation, Cebuano was classed as a
language which would be of medium difficulty to
process - the main problems being that no large-
scale translation dictionaries, parallel corpora
or morphological analyser could be found. How-
ever, the language has a Latin script, is written
with spaces between words, and has capitalisa-
tion similar to Western languages, all of which
make processing a much easier task than for,
say, Chinese or Arabic. The important points
are therefore that little work has been done on
the language, and few resources exist, but that
the language is not intrinsically hard to process.

1.2 Named Entity Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.959258794871795">
We concentrated our efforts on the task of re-
source development for named entity recogni-
tion, since correct entity recognition is a vital
precursor to many other applications such as
Machine Translation and CLIR. Robust tools
for multilingual information extraction are be-
coming increasingly sought after now that we
&apos;available at
http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Projects/TIDES/language-
summary-table.html
have capabilities for processing texts in different
languages and scripts (for example, in GATE
which is fully Unicode-compliant). Following
previous efforts to adapt the ANNIE informa-
tion extraction system (the default IE system
that comes with the GATE architecture) to dif-
ferent languages and applications (e.g. (May-
nard and Cunningham, 2003; Maynard et al.,
2002), we decided to investigate whether we
could adapt ANNIE to an unknown language
within a very limited period of time.
There are two particularly important points
to note about our proposed approach. First,
ANNIE is a rule-based system, which means
that it does not require large amounts of train-
ing data, unlike most NE systems which rely at
least partially on machine learning algorithms,
such as (Bikel et al., 1999). This is a benefit
since we were not likely to find suitable pre-
existing training data. Second, we could not
guarantee that we would have a native speaker
available to help us develop rules for the sys-
tem. This appears initially to counteract the
benefit of using a rule-based system, since how
could we expect to develop rules for a language
of which we had no knowledge, if we had no
training data? Perhaps surprisingly, this turned
out not to be a major problem, as will be ex-
plained in more detail in the following sections.

2 Resources
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949666666667">
A collaborative effort was made by all partic-
ipants to collect and make available tools and
resources which might be useful. These were
divided into general tools (not necessarily for
Cebuano), monolingual text resources, bilingual
text resources, and lexical resources. Other use-
ful information, such as details of Cebuano na-
tive speakers who were willing to help, was also
made available, where appropriate.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977415">
2.1 Text Resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999001428571429">
Clearly, monolingual (Cebuano) texts were nec-
essary in order to have clean data to work on.
Various websites were found containing news
texts, though these had mostly to be down-
loaded daily because there were no archives. In
particular we found two good sources: Super-
balita2 and iliganon.com3 (local news from Ili-

gan City and the surrounding area).
Other sites found bilingual text resources on-
line, such as the Bible, but these were not par-
ticularly helpful to us since they did not contain
the kinds of entities we were interested in. Had
we found any such texts, it could have been very
useful as a method of mining the English texts
for gazetteer entries and grammar rules.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998741">
2.2 Lexical Resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999173">
Various lexical resources were located and made
available by the participating sites, such as a
list of surnames, and some bilingual dictionar-
ies. However, many of these resources were not
available until after we had already built our
system.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988629">
2.3 Other Resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994816">
Due to the limited amount of time available, it
was unfeasible to find Cebuano speakers who
had computational and linguistic skills, and to
train them to use GATE and learn to write
grammar rules etc. An extensive search via
email and the Internet revealed several native
speakers who were prepared to help, however.
We made use of one local native speakers to
annotate some texts with Named Entities man-
ually (on paper), so that we could evaluate our
system. We also made use of a native speaker
in the US found by another site, who evaluated
some preliminary results for us (again, on pa-
per). The results of our search for speakers was
encouraging in that we found many more con-
tacts who could have been used had we had the
time and money available.
One particular gem was the discovery of a
Yahoo groups email discussion list for Cebuano
speakers. Members of this list were able to pro-
vide us with some resources such as electronic
dictionaries not available on the Internet, and
(had we had the time and money) could have
again been a very useful source of further infor-
mation.

3 Adapting ANNIE to Cebuano
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967080333333333">
GATE is one of the few architectures to sup-
port multilingual processing, using Unicode as
its default text encoding. While the default
IE system is English-specific, some of the mod-
ules can be reused directly (e.g. the Unicode-
based tokeniser can handle Indo-European Ian-
guages), and/or easily customised for new lan-
guages (Pastra et al., 2002).
The system consists of the following resources
taken from ANNIE: tokeniser, sentence splitter,
POS tagger, gazetteer, NE grammar, and or-
thomatcher. Some of these were used without
modification, the others were modified for Ce-
buano as described below. Figure 1 shows a
diagram of the architecture of the system.

3.1 POS Tagger
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997867">
The Hepple POS tagger, which is freely avail-
able in GATE as part of ANNIE, is similar to
the Brill&apos;s transformation-based tagger (Brill,
1992), but differs mainly in that it uses a deci-
sion list variant of Brill&apos;s algorithm. This means
that in classifying any instance, only one trans-
formation can apply. It is also written in Java.
Having acquired a bilingual Cebuano-English
lexicon containing also POS information, we de-
cided to test whether we could adapt the Hep-
ple tagger to Cebuano. On first appearances
it seemed that Cebuano word order and mor-
phology is similar to English, and it also has
similar orthography. The rules for English (de-
rived from training on the Wall Street Journal)
would clearly not be applicable for Cebuano, so
we used an empty ruleset, but we decided that
many of the default heuristics might still be ap-
propriate. The heuristics are essentially as fol-
lows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999623076923077">
1. look up the word in the lexicon
2. if no lexicon entry found:
• if capitalised return NNP
• if word containes &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; return JJ
• if word contains a digit return CD
• if word ends in &amp;quot;ed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;us&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ble&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;ive&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ish&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ary&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ful&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ical&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;less&amp;quot; return JJ
• if word ends in &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; return NNS
• if word ends in &amp;quot;ly&amp;quot; return RB
• if word ends in &amp;quot;ing&amp;quot; return VBG
• if none of the above matched return
NN
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.932139222222222">
3. apply the trained rules to make changes to
the assigned categories based on the con-
text
These rules make sense for Cebuano because it
is unusual for Cebuano words to have endings
such as &amp;quot;ic&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;ly&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ing&amp;quot; etc. This means that
in most cases, the tag returned will be NNP
(proper noun) if capitalised, or NN (common
noun) if not, which is appropriate.

Adapting the tagger did have a number of
problems, mostly associated with the fact that
while the English lexicon (used for the tag-
ger) consists only of single-word entries, the Ce-
buano lexicon contained many multi-word en-
tries (such as mahitungod sa honi (musical), as

shown in Figure 2). The tagger expects lexicon
entries to have a single word entry per line, fol-
lowed by one or more POS tags, each separated
by a single space.
We therefore modified the lexicon so that
the delimiter between the lexical entry and the
POS tag(s) was a &amp;quot;#&amp;quot; rather than a space,
and adapted the tagging mechanism to recog-
nise this. This enabled us to use multi-word
lexical entries. As shown in Figure 2, there was
also the problem that Cebuano synonyms were
placed all on one line, rather than as separate
entries, and that, conversely, where a Cebuano
entry had more than one POS category associ-
ated with it, these had been included as sep-
arate entries. This, along with reordering the
entries, adjusting the format to fit with the En-
glish lexicon and converting the POS tags to
Penn Treebank-style tags, was a fairly trivial
problem fixed automatically using a series of
scripts.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.962526">
3.2 Tokeniser
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982838235294">
Once the lexicon had been reformatted, a final
problem remained. The POS tagger is imple-
mented in GATE such that it assigns a POS
category as a feature and value to a Token (as
identified by the Tokeniser). Many of the Ce-
buano lexical entries are multi-word, and there-
fore multi-token (since the tokeniser delimits to-
kens according to white space), and therefore
the entries would not match tokens found in the
text and tags could not be correctly assigned.
To solve this, we used a similar mechanism to
that used for the English tokeniser in GATE
(as opposed to the default Unicode tokeniser),
which incorporates an extra processing compo-
nent that joins together various tokens into one
in order to deal with the problem of tagging
the possessive &amp;quot;&apos;s&amp;quot; as a single unit rather than
as two separate ones. This is detailed in the
GATE User Guide (Cunningham et al., 2002).
We therefore created two additional
Cebuano-specific processing resources to
complement the default Unicode tokeniser, in
the form of a gazetteer list and JAPE (Java
Annotations Pattern Language) grammar. The
gazetteer list consisted of all the multi-word
entries from the Cebuano lexicon. The JAPE
grammar was used to match any of these multi-
word entries found in the text and combine the
Token annotations (created by the tokeniser)
into a single annotation in each case. This was
run before the POS tagger, so that the tagger
would then have as input one Token annotation
per lexical entry, and would be able to generate
a single POS tag as a feature on each entry.
We currently have no means of evaluating
the POS tagger, but initial results based on
the manual annotation of Named Entities look
promising (for example, proper nouns are cor-
rectly tagged). The creation of the tagger took
approximately 2 person-days, and we were able
to make it available to other sites within 4 days
of the language being announced (we did not
start work on it on day 1). This was useful to
sites working in a variety of different areas. For
example, one site were planning some annota-
tion projection experiments to develop taggers,
and wanted output from our tagger to provide a
useful reference point. Another site working on
date/time tagging needed POS annotations to
help them identify numbers, while those work-
ing on Machine Translation (MT) and Cross-
Language Information Retrieval (CUR) could
also clearly benefit from such information.
The POS tagger can only be used within
GATE (which currently has thousands of users
at hundreds of sites worldwide), but we were
also able to offer a tagging service to the other
program participants, whereby they could email
us a set of texts and we would return the results
of tagging as XML or HTML files within a mat-
ter of minutes - either as inline annotations or as
TIPSTER-compliant standoff markup (the de-
fault GATE method), according to their prefer-
ence.
Figure 3 shows a small sample of text
&amp;quot;Moabot ngadton sa 1,&amp;quot; marked with inline
POS annotations. Figure 4 shows the same text
marked with standoff POS annotations.

Perhaps surprisingly, there seemed to be little
information available on the Internet that could
be used to compile gazetteer lists. Some lists of
Philippine cities were donated to us, but little
else seemed to be readily available. We therefore
investigated the news corpora collected by var-
ious sites, and discovered a corpus of Cebuano
local news texts, of which the majority were in
English, but some were in Cebuano. We mined
the English texts for names of organisations, lo-
cations, people&apos;s first names, etc. and created

some new gazetteer lists. We also created lists
of expressions such as days of the week, months
of the year, numbers etc. from online dictionar-
ies and phrasebooks. Furthermore, we found
some typical clue words in Cebuano news texts
such as jobtitles which were recognisable due to
their similarity with either English or Spanish.
For example &amp;quot;Presidente&amp;quot; followed by a proper
noun clearly could be translated as President,
which enabled us to deduce that the following
proper noun was a person&apos;s name. These clue
words were also compiled into gazetteer lists.
The GATE gazetteer processing resource en-
ables gazetteer lists to be described in 3 ways:
majorType, minorType and language. The ma-
jor and minor types enable entries to be classi-
fied according to two dimensions or at 2 levels of
granularity — for example a list of cities might
have a majorType &amp;quot;location&amp;quot; and minorType
&amp;quot;city&amp;quot;. Using the language classification en-
abled us to keep the same structure for the Ce-
buano lists as for their English counterparts,
and simply alter the language label, enabling
us a method of differentiation. Because some
names of English entities were found in the Ce-
buano texts (e.g. &amp;quot;Cebu City Police Office&amp;quot;), we
required both the English gazetteer (to recog-
nise &amp;quot;Office&amp;quot;) and the Cebuano gazetteer (to
recognise &amp;quot;Cebu City&amp;quot;, which is not in the
English gazetteer). Using both gazetteers im-
proved recall and did not appear to affect pre-
cision, since English entities did not seem to
be ambiguous with Cebuano entities or proper
nouns. We did not perform extensive evaluation
on this though, for reasons of time.

3.4 Named Entity Grammars
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999475">
Most of the JAPE rules for NE recognition in
English are based on POS tags and gazetteer
lookup of candidate and context words (more
detail is given in e.g. (Cunningham et al., 2002).
Assuming similar morphological structure and
word order, the default grammars are therefore
not highly language-specific, as was discovered
when they were adapted for Romanian (Hamza
et al., 2002; Pastra et al., 2002). We did not
have time to make a detailed linguistic study of
Cebuano, though for the full experiment in the
summer we would do this.

3.5 Orthomatcher
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997725">
We used the orthographic coreference mod-
ule (orthomatcher) to boost recognition of un-
known words. This works by matching entities
tagged as Unknown with other types of enti-
ties (Person, Location etc.) if they match ac-
cording to the coreference rules. For exam-
ple, &amp;quot;Smith&amp;quot; on its own might be tagged as
Unknown, but if &amp;quot;John Smith&amp;quot; is tagged as a
Person, the orthomatcher will match the two
entities and retag &amp;quot;Smith&amp;quot; as a Person. We
predicted that the rules would not be partic-
ularly language-specific, given a language with
similar morphology and word order, so we used
the orthomatcher directly, without modifica-
tion. Manual inspection of texts showed that
the orthomatcher was helpful in improving re-
call. For example, it recognised &amp;quot;Pairat&amp;quot; as a
Person due to coreference with &amp;quot;Leo Pairat&amp;quot;
which was correctly recognised as a Person by
the first grammar. Although we were not focus-
ing on coreference per se, we noticed that many
coreferences were correctly identified, which
proves indeed that the rules used are not par-
ticularly language-specific.

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937304347826">
The team at the University of Maryland of-
fered to get one of their native speakers to
evaluate some sample texts annotated by our
system. The annotations done by this native
speaker were not perfect (we noticed that they
had wrongly tagged some generic and common
nouns as Locations, for example), but they were
the only method of evaluation we had available
within our restricted time. We used the system
to tag 10 news texts taken from the Superbalita
news corpus, and wrote a small JAPE grammar
to produce the output in a form whereby each
entity type was highlighted in a different colour
when saved as an HTML file, so that the re-
sult could be viewed in a web browser, without
access to the actual annotations. This was be-
cause it was too time-consuming to teach the
annotator to use GATE. The annotator marked
on a paper copy which entities were correct, in-
correct, partially correct and missing, and faxed
us the copies.
The results were 85.1% Precision, 58.2% re-
call, and an F measure of 69.1%. Because of
the way the marking was done, we do not have
figures to hand for the individual entity types.
We also ran a second experiment with a fur-
ther 12 files from the Superbalita news cor-
pus, and 9 files from the Iliganon news corpus.
These texts were annotated by a local Cebuano
speaker prior to our experiment, and the au-
tomated scoring tools in GATE were used to
evaluate the results of the system. The results
(in terms of Precision, Recall and F-measure)
are shown in Table 1, together with with the
results from our baseline system, the default
ANNIE system for English, which we ran on
the same test set. ANNIE typically scores for
Precision and Recall in the 90th percentile for
English news texts.
Clearly the results for Recall are much higher
for these texts than for the other set. We sus-
pect that there are two reasons for this. First,
between running the first and second experi-
ment, we added to the gazetteers using infor-
mation from the English news corpus. Second,
we strongly suspect that there are many super-

fluous key annotations in the data for the first
experiment. For example, we noticed that many
common nouns, such as &amp;quot;the doctor&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the
committee&amp;quot; had been wrongly tagged as Person
and Organization entities.
Because our native speaker was not experi-
enced in NE recognition and we had no time for
full training, we found some cases where the key
annotations were inaccurate. For example many
relative dates (of the type &amp;quot;next week&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;this
year&amp;quot;) were missed, and organisations where the
abbreviation was given in brackets were treated
as the same entity as the full name, e.g. &amp;quot;Na-
tional Steel Corporation (NSC)&amp;quot; was tagged as
one Organization entity and not two.
There were many cases where our system cor-
rectly identified entities that our human annota-
tors missed or tagged incorrectly. For example,
our human annotator wrongly tagged &amp;quot;Sanggu-
niang Panlungsod&amp;quot; (City Council) as a Loca-
tion, which our system correctly identified it as
an Organization. We identified this mistake by
using GATE&apos;s AnnotationDiff tool to search for
errors. Looking at the text the entity seemed
to refer to an organisation, so we searched for it
on the Internet using Google, and discovered
a website which gave the English translation
&amp;quot;City Council&amp;quot; from which we can deduce that
it is an Organization.
Figure 5 shows a screenshot of a Cebuano
news text tagged by our system.

Such errors indicate that the evaluations are by
no means conclusive, but they do indicate that
our system achieved a very creditable perfor-
mance. If the manual annotations had been
more correct, we believe that the evaluation re-
sults would have been higher.
We were extremely pleased with the results,
given the time constraints of the work and the
fact that we had used no native speaker or train-
ing data to produce the system. We have no
real comparison against other systems on this
kind of work, because we were the only site
participating in the program who attempted
named entity recognition. For the full exercise
in June 2003, however, we imagine that there
will be other systems performing NE recogni-
tion, against which we can form some perfor-
mance comparison. It is interesting to compare
this work with that of (Palmer and Day, 1997),
who demonstrated the large differences in lan-
guages for the NE task, but who also concluded
that much of the NE recognition task can be
performed with a very simple analysis of NE
strings and
Clearly the choice of the Cebuano language
brought some important benefits for our system.
We needed to make only very small changes
to the tokeniser and NE grammar, and needed
no modifications at all to the sentence split-
ter and orthomatcher components. We did not
make use of any morphological analysis or pars-
ing components. A language with a different
script and/or significantly different morphology
or word order would have necessitated many
more modifications to the system, and clearly
we would have struggled to produce such a sys-
tem within the time limits without a native
speaker. However, for such a language, there
might have been more tools and resources al-
ready available. For example, many people have
already worked on tools for Chinese and Arabic,
and there is a lot more data available. Cebuano
was very limited in this respect. A significantly
different language would therefore have neces-
sitated a totally different approach, for exam-
ple using machine learning techniques. Luckily
GATE offers support for this since it is now in-
tegrated with WEKA and has various compo-
nents for machine learning and Hidden Markov
Models, so this could be an option for the full
exercise in the summer

There are two particularly important points to note about our proposed approach. First, ANNIE is a rule-based system, which means that it does not require large amounts of training data, unlike most NE systems which rely at least partially on machine learning algorithms, such as (Bikel et al., 1999). This is a benefit since we were not likely to find suitable preexisting training data. Second, we could not guarantee that we would have a native speaker available to help us develop rules for the system. This appears initially to counteract the benefit of using a rule-based system, since how could we expect to develop rules for a language of which we had no knowledge, if we had no training data? Perhaps surprisingly, this turned out not to be a major problem, as will be explained in more detail in the following sections. 2 Resources A collaborative effort was made by all participants to col</context>

The system consists of the following resources taken from ANNIE: tokeniser, sentence splitter, POS tagger, gazetteer, NE grammar, and orthomatcher. Some of these were used without modification, the others were modified for Cebuano as described below. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the architecture of the system. ANNIE Modules Cebuano Modules Figure 1: Architecture of Cebuano NE system 3.1 POS Tagger The Hepple POS tagger, which is freely available in GATE as part of ANNIE, is similar to the Brill&apos;s transformation-based tagger (Brill, 1992), but differs mainly in that it uses a decision list variant of Brill&apos;s algorithm. This means that in classifying any instance, only one transformation can apply. It is also written in Java. Having acquired a bilingual Cebuano-English lexicon containing also POS information, we decided to test whether we could adapt the Hepple tagger to Cebuano. On first appearances it seemed that Cebuano word order and morphology is similar to English, and it also has similar orthography. The rules for English (derived from training on the Wall Street Journal) would clearly not be applicable for Cebuano, so w</context>

To solve this, we used a similar mechanism to that used for the English tokeniser in GATE (as opposed to the default Unicode tokeniser), which incorporates an extra processing component that joins together various tokens into one in order to deal with the problem of tagging the possessive &amp;quot;&apos;s&amp;quot; as a single unit rather than as two separate ones. This is detailed in the GATE User Guide (Cunningham et al., 2002). We therefore created two additional Cebuano-specific processing resources to complement the default Unicode tokeniser, in the form of a gazetteer list and JAPE (Java Annotations Pattern Language) grammar. The gazetteer list consisted of all the multi-word entries from the Cebuano lexicon. The JAPE grammar was used to match any of these multiword entries found in the text and combine the Token annotations (created by the tokeniser) into a single annotation in each case. This was run before the POS tagger, so that the tagger would then have as input one Token annotation per lexical entry, and </context>

Using both gazetteers improved recall and did not appear to affect precision, since English entities did not seem to be ambiguous with Cebuano entities or proper nouns. We did not perform extensive evaluation on this though, for reasons of time. 3.4 Named Entity Grammars Most of the JAPE rules for NE recognition in English are based on POS tags and gazetteer lookup of candidate and context words (more detail is given in e.g. (Cunningham et al., 2002). Assuming similar morphological structure and word order, the default grammars are therefore not highly language-specific, as was discovered when they were adapted for Romanian (Hamza et al., 2002; Pastra et al., 2002). We did not have time to make a detailed linguistic study of Cebuano, though for the full experiment in the summer we would do this. 3.5 Orthomatcher We used the orthographic coreference module (orthomatcher) to boost recognition of unknown words.
