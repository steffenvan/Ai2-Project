<bodyText confidence="0.99993464">
We describe the experiments of the UC Berke-
ley team on improving English-Spanish ma-
chine translation of news text, as part of the
WMT’08 Shared Translation Task. We ex-
periment with domain adaptation, combin-
ing a small in-domain news bi-text and a
large out-of-domain one from the Europarl
corpus, building two separate phrase transla-
tion models and two separate language mod-
els. We further add a third phrase transla-
tion model trained on a version of the news
bi-text augmented with monolingual sentence-
level syntactic paraphrases on the source-
language side, and we combine all models in
a log-linear model using minimum error rate
training. Finally, we experiment with differ-
ent tokenization and recasing rules, achieving
35.09% Bleu score on the WMT’07 news test
data when translating from English to Span-
ish, which is a sizable improvement over the
highest Bleu score achieved on that dataset
at WMT’07: 33.10% (in fact, by our sys-
tem). On the WMT’08 English to Spanish
news translation, we achieve 21.92%, which
makes our team the second best on Bleu score.

state-of-the art performance, but on out-of-domain
test data the results can get significantly worse. For
example, on the WMT’06 Shared Translation Task,
the scores for French to English translation dropped
from about 30 to about 20 Bleu points for nearly all
systems when tested on News Commentary rather
than Europarl text, which was used on training
(Koehn and Monz, 2006).
Therefore, in 2007 the Shared Task organizers
provided 1M words of bilingual News Commentary
training data in addition to the 30M Europarl data,
thus inviting interest in domain adaptation experi-
ments. Given the success of the idea, the same task
was offered this year with slightly larger training bi-
texts: 1.3M and 32M words, respectively.

The team of the University of California at Berkeley
(ucb) participated in the WMT’08 Shared Transla-
tion Task with two systems, English—*Spanish and
Spanish—*English, applied to translating News Com-
mentary text, for which a very limited amount of
training data was provided. We experimented with
domain adaptation, combining the provided small
in-domain bi-text and the large out-of-domain one
from the Europarl corpus, building two phrase trans-
lation models and two language models. We further
added a third phrase translation model trained on a
version of the news bi-text augmented with mono-
lingual sentence-level syntactic paraphrases on the
source-language side, and we combined all models
in one big log-linear model using minimum error
rate training. We also experimented with different
tokenization and recasing ideas.

2.1 Sentence-Level Syntactic Paraphrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996366666667">
The idea of using paraphrases is motivated by the
observation that, in many cases, the testing text
contains pieces that are equivalent, but syntacti-
cally different from the phrases learned on train-
ing, which might result in missing the opportu-
nity for a high-quality translation. For example, an
English—*Spanish SMT system could have an entry
in its phrase table for inequality of income, but not
for income inequality. Note that the latter phrase
is hard to translate into Spanish where noun com-
pounds are rare: the correct translation in this case
requires a suitable Spanish preposition and a re-
ordering, which are hard for the system to realize
and do properly. We address this problem by gen-
erating nearly-equivalent syntactic paraphrases of
the source-side training sentences, targeted at noun
compounds. We then pair each paraphrased sen-
tence with the foreign translation associated with the
original sentence in the training data. The resulting
augmented bi-text is used to train an SMT system,
which learns many useful new phrases. The idea
was introduced in (Nakov and Hearst, 2007), and is
described in more detail in (Nakov, 2007).
Unfortunately, using multiple paraphrased ver-
sions of the same sentence changes the word fre-
quencies in the training bi-text, thus causing worse
maximum likelihood estimates, which results in bad
system performance. However, real improvements
can still be achieved by merging the phrase tables of
the two systems, giving priority to the original.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999158">
2.2 Domain Adaptation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999948">
In our previous findings (Nakov and Hearst, 2007),
we found that using in-domain and out-of-domain
language models is the best way to perform do-
main adaptation. Following (Koehn and Schroeder,
2007), we further used two phrase tables.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99959">
2.3 Improving the Recaser
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956142857143">
One problem we noticed with the default recasing
is that unknown words are left in lowercase. How-
ever, many unknown words are in fact named en-
tities (persons, organization, or locations), which
should be spelled capitalized. Therefore, we pre-
pared a new recasing script, which makes sure that
all unknown words keep their original case.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994023">
2.4 Changing Tokenization/Detokenization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994485">
We found the default tokenizer problematic: it
keeps complex adjectives as one word, e.g., well-
rehearsed, self-assured, Arab-Israeli. While lin-
guistically correct, this is problematic for machine
translation due to data sparsity. For example, the
SMT system might know how to translate into Span-
ish both well and rehearsed, but not well-rehearsed,
and thus at translation time it would be forced to
handle it as an unknown word. A similar problem
is related to double dashes ‘--’, as illustrated by the
following training sentence: “So the question now
is what can China do to freeze--and, if possible, to
reverse--North Korea’s nuclear program.”
Therefore, we changed the tokenizer, so that it
puts a space around ‘-’ and ‘--’. We also changed the
detokenizer accordingly, adding some rules for fix-
ing erroneous output, e.g., making sure that in Span-
ish text ¿ and ?, ¡ and ! match. We also added some
rules for numbers, e.g., the English 1,185.32 should
be spelled as 1.185,32 in Spanish.

3 The UCB System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991416666667">
As Table 1 shows, we performed many experiments
varying different parameters of the system. Due to
space limitations, here we will only describe our best
system, news10�euro10�par10.
To build the system, we trained three separate
phrase-based SMT systems (max phrase lengths 10):
on the original News Commentary corpus (news),
on the paraphrased version of News Commentary
(par), and on the Europarl dataset (euro). As a re-
sult, we obtained three phrase tables, Tnews, Tpar,
and Teuro, and three lexicalized reordering models,
Rnews, Rpar, and Reuro, which we had to merge.
First, we kept all phrase pairs from Tnews. Then
we added those phrase pairs from Teuro which were
not present in Tnews. Finally, we added to them
those from Tpar which were not in Tnews nor in
Teuro. For each phrase pair added, we retained its as-
sociated features: forward phrase translation proba-
bility, reverse phrase translation probability, forward
lexical translation probability, reverse lexical trans-
lation probability, and phrase penalty. We further
added three new features – Pnews, Peuro, and Ppar –
each of them was 1 if the phrase pair came from that
system, and 0.5 otherwise.

each phrase pair came from, while the + operation indicates the phrase tables are used together without priorities. The
models using the + operation are marked with a * as a reminder that the involved phrase tables are used together, as
opposed to being priority-merged. Note also that the models from II.3.1. only use the Spanish part of the Europarl

We further merged Rnews, Reuro, and Rpo,r in
a similar manner: we first kept all phrases from
Rnews, then we added those from Reuro which were
not present in Rnews, and finally those from Rpor
which were not in Rnews nor in Reuro.
We used two language models with Kneser-Ney
smoothing: a 3-gram model trained on News Com-
mentary, and a 5-gram model trained on Europarl.
We then trained a log-linear model using the fol-
lowing feature functions: language model proba-
bilities, word penalty, distortion cost, and the pa-
rameters from the phrase table. We set the feature
weights by optimizing the Bleu score directly using
minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) on the de-
velopment set. We used these weights in a beam
search decoder to produce translations for the test
sentences, which we compared to the WMT’07 gold
standard using Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002).

4 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99962328125">
Table 1 shows the evaluation results using the
WMT’07 News Commentary test data. Our best
English—*Spanish system news10�euro10�par10
(see the table caption for explanation of the nota-
tion), which is also our submission, achieved 35.09
Bleu score with the improved recaser; with the de-
fault recaser, the score drops to 34.85.
Due to space limitations, our Spanish—*English
results are not in Table 1. This time, we did not use
paraphrases, and our best system news10�euro10
achieved 35.78 and 35.17 Bleu score with the im-
proved and the default recaser, respectively.
As the table shows, using the improved recaser
yields consistent improvements by about 0.3 Bleu
points. Using an out-of-domain language model
adds about 2 additional Bleu points, e.g., news10
improves from 32.53 to 34.26, and news10�par10
improves from 32.34 to 34.71. The impact of
also adding an out-of-domain phrase table is tiny:
news10�euro7 improves on news10 by 0.05 only.
Adding paraphrases however can yield an absolute
improvement of about 0.6, e.g., 34.31 vs. 34.97
for news10�euro7 and news10�euro7�par10. Inter-
estingly, using an out-of-domain phrase table has a
bigger impact when paraphrases are used, e.g., for
news10�par10 and news10�euro7�par10 we have
34.71 and 34.97, respectively. Finally, we were sur-
prised to find out that using the new tokenizer does
not help: for news10 the default tokenizer yields
32.67, while the new one only achieves 32.53. This
is surprising for us, since the new tokenizer used to
help consistent on the WMT’06 data.

5 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999915">
We described the UCB system for the WMT’08
Shared Translation Task. By combining in-domain
and out-of-domain data, and by using sentence-
level syntactic paraphrases and a better recaser, we
achieved an improvement of almost 2 Bleu points1
over the best result on the WMT’07 test data2,
and the second best Bleu score for this year’s
English—*Spanish translation of news text.
In future work, we plan a deeper analysis of the
obtained results. First, we would like to experiment
with new ways to combine data from different do-
mains. We also plan to further improve the recaser,
and to investigate why the new tokenizer did not help
for the WMT’07 data.

We address this problem by generating nearly-equivalent syntactic paraphrases of the source-side training sentences, targeted at noun compounds. We then pair each paraphrased sentence with the foreign translation associated with the original sentence in the training data. The resulting augmented bi-text is used to train an SMT system, which learns many useful new phrases. The idea was introduced in (Nakov and Hearst, 2007), and is described in more detail in (Nakov, 2007). Unfortunately, using multiple paraphrased versions of the same sentence changes the word frequencies in the training bi-text, thus causing worse maximum likelihood estimates, which results in bad system performance. However, real improvements can still be achieved by merging the phrase tables of the two systems, giving priority to the original. 2.2 Domain Adaptation In our previous findings (Nakov and Hearst, 2007), we found that using in-domain and out-of-domain language models is the best way to perform domain adaptation. Following (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007), we further used two phrase ta</context>

We used two language models with Kneser-Ney smoothing: a 3-gram model trained on News Commentary, and a 5-gram model trained on Europarl. We then trained a log-linear model using the following feature functions: language model probabilities, word penalty, distortion cost, and the parameters from the phrase table. We set the feature weights by optimizing the Bleu score directly using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) on the development set. We used these weights in a beam search decoder to produce translations for the test sentences, which we compared to the WMT’07 gold standard using Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002). 4 Results and Discussion Table 1 shows the evaluation results using the WMT’07 News Commentary test data. Our best English—*Spanish system news10�euro10�par10 (see the table caption for explanation of the notation), which is also our submission, achieved 35.09 Bleu score with the improved recaser; with the default recaser, the score drops to 34.85.
