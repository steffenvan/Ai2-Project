Abstract

In this paper we address the issue of the
encoding of information on metaphors in
a WordNet-like database, i.e. the Italian
wordnet in EuroWordNet (ItalWordNet).
When analysing corpus data we find a
huge number of metaphoric expressions
which can be hardly dealt with by using
as reference database ItalWordNet. In
particular, we have compared information
contained both in dictionaries of Italian
and in ItalWordNet with actual uses of
words found in a corpus. We thus put
forward proposals to enrich a resource
like ItalWordNet with relevant informa-
tion.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.974232172413793">
Lexical resources are a fundamental part of natural
language processing systems and many research
projects in the last decades have been devoted to
build them. Notwithstanding, work is still needed
to envisage what information should be encoded in
which resource, and how, in order to deal with the
central problem of word sense disambiguation.
As becomes clear when analysing textual cor-
pora, novel uses of words occur frequently and, in
particular, metaphoric new uses of them. Re-
sources which simply list the different
polysemous senses of a word without saying any-
thing about how they relate to each other are not
useful in such cases. One such resource is Word-
Net (WN), together with its ‘relative-resource’, i.e.
EuroWordNet (EWN).1
In this paper we start by briefly recalling the
theory of metaphor as a cognitive rather than a lin-
guistic phenomenon, proposed by Lakoff and
Johnson (1980) and Lakoff (1993), that has
spawned a variety of research in various fields
connected with the study of language.2 Then, we
take into analysis examples of words displaying
metaphorical sense extensions and discuss data
from the Italian wordnet in EWN (ItalWordNet -

2 Metaphor

<bodyText confidence="0.9998594">
Lakoff and Johnson (1980) and Lakoff (1993)
show that metaphor is not just a poetical way of
speaking, rather it is deeply embedded in our lan-
guage, culture and the way we think. Metaphor
affects how we experience and interact with the
world and other people: “the human conceptual
system is metaphorically structured and defined.
Metaphors as linguistic expressions are possible
precisely because there are metaphors in a person’s
conceptual system.” (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980:
6).
Thus, metaphor is a cognitive rather than a lin-
guistic phenomenon, and word senses are related in
terms of their underlying conceptual domains.
Metaphoric linguistic expressions are manifesta-
tions of ‘conceptual metaphors’, i.e. metaphorical
structures which are present in our minds and re-
late a concrete source domain with a more abstract
target domain. In other words, metaphoric expres-
sions are the superficial realization of the mapping
we perform from a ‘literal’ source semantic do-
main to a ‘figurative’ target semantic domain. At
least two consequences follow from this perspec-
tive which should be considered when building a
lexicon for NLP applications:

time;

3 Metaphoric expressions in EWN-IWN

When looking for word sense distinctions within
different lexical resources we see that these vary
widely across resources. 4 Different dictionaries
distinguish among different senses of words in a
sort of arbitrary way, since they are strongly influ-
enced by the purpose of the resource (the target
audience), and have different editorial philosophies
with respect to ‘lumping vs. splitting’ of senses
(Atkins, 1993; Kilgarriff, 1997). Dictionaries nor-
mally contain distinctions between ‘literal’ vs.
‘figurative’ meanings within a lexical entry. How-
ever, such information is in general, at best, ‘in-
complete’:

3. data which could help to identify novel

metaphoric expressions are not provided.
EWN first and IWN then were built using as
source data dictionaries available in machine-
readable form, thus they contain inconsistencies
and shortage of data partly inherited from diction-
aries, in particular with respect to figurative lan-
guage. Consider, for instance, the verb andare (to
go): it has 17 senses in IWN (reported below), two
of which are strictly motion senses while the others
are figurative senses somehow derived from the
two basic ones, with different degrees of proximity
to the literal senses.
4 We assume some sort of intuitive pre-theoretical notion of
word-sense, which we are well aware that can be disputed.
Much research has been devoted at the issues of what a word-
sense is and if word-senses ‘exist’ at all and should be consid-
ered as the basic units of the lexicon. Although we agree with
views according to which “word senses exist only relative to a
task” (Kilgarriff, 1997: 1), and are at the same time appealed
by proposals for ‘coarse coding’ (Harris, 1994), we still be-
lieve that a WN-like structure, taking the concepts and the
synsets referring to them as the ‘building blocks’ of the (men-
tal) lexicon, is both appropriate as a representation of lexical
knowledge (with the basic idea of a net linking the concepts)
and can be used as a resource for NLP, provided that the pos-
sible uses and actual limits of such a resource are kept clear.

Table 1. Senses of andare in IWN
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999187930232558">
Senses 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 16 and 17 are clearly
more directly derived from the two basic senses
(either the first or the second): e.g., senses 5, 6, 11,
12 can all be linked to the general ‘CHANGE IS
MOTION’ conceptual metaphor; sense 13 to the
‘ACTION IS MOTION’ metaphor, etc. The re-
maining senses seem also connected with the mo-
tion senses, although in a less direct way. 5 Only
two of the metaphoric senses are marked as ‘figu-
rative’ and no indication is provided of the connec-
tion between each metaphoric sense and the basic
literal sense it is derived from. Moreover, if we
take into consideration dictionaries of Italian like
Zingarelli or Garzanti, 6 we find different sense
definitions for andare: Zingarelli has 13 senses
(with some information on connection of senses)
and Garzanti has 11 (with no indication of sense
connections). Finally, no information is provided,
either in IWN or in the other resources, which
could be used to automatically disambiguate novel
metaphoric uses of the verb.
If we then look for occurrences of andare in a
corpus of Italian (the PAROLE corpus, partly
available at http://www.ilc.cnr.it/pisystem/demo/
demo_dbt/demo_corpus/index.htm; cf. Goggi et
al., 2000), we find occurrences of the verb which
are hardly linked to the senses provided in our re-
sources. Consider just two examples taken from
this corpus:
a. Borg è già tornato e se n`è già andato in un
mondo tutto suo (Borg has already come back
and he has gone into his own world)
b. Altri sono andati con la memoria alle im-
magini televisive della guerra del Golfo (Oth-
ers went with their memory to the television
images of the Gulf war).
These two uses of the verb are quite frequent in
spoken language, however they are not accounted
for in the resources considered.
When comparing corpus occurrences of words
with information encoded in IWN, as in other lexi-
cal resources, one normally sees that there is a sur-
prisingly high frequency of figurative senses in

<footnote confidence="0.995942133333333">
5 E.g., sense 8 is found in sentences like “Questo lavoro va
fatto subito” (This work has to be done immediately), where
andare expresses a duty. We might suppose the existence of a
conceptual metaphor like “TO FULFIL ONE’S DUTY IS TO
MOVE TO A GOAL”. This could be linked to a more general
“ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING IS REACHING A
GOAL” metaphor, again connected with the “ACTION IS
MOTION” metaphor. Of course, this analysis needs to be
deepened; in particular, among other cases, one should also
take into consideration the use of venire (to come), which in
its basic sense indicates opposite direction with respect to
andare, in sentences like “Questo lavoro viene fatto regolar-
mente” (This work is done regularly).

real texts but most of these senses are not de-
scribed in such resources (cf. Nimb and Sanford
Pedersen, 2000, for data identified within the
SIMPLE EC project and the solutions proposed in
that context). Alonge and Castelli (2002a) take into
account corpus occurrences of the verb colpire (to
hit/to strike/to shoot) and the noun colpo
(blow/stroke/shot), and compare the results of this
analysis with data found for these words within
IWN, concluding that IWN lacks precise informa-
tion on frequent metaphoric uses of colpire and
colpo. Indeed, the data provided show that by ana-
lyzing a large general corpus various metaphoric
expressions are clearly distinguishable which are
not (consistently) identified in IWN or in other
resources. Thus, how should these figurative
senses be accounted for in a WN-like resource (in
particular, in EWN/IWN)? Moreover, how should
novel, potential uses of words be dealt with in a
resource such IWN? We believe that the ability to
cope with these issues cannot be set aside if IWN,
or similar resources, has to be used for word sense
disambiguation of ‘real’ texts.

4 Proposals for metaphors encoding in
IWN/EWN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999061730337078">
As already mentioned, by analyzing a large general
corpus various well-established metaphoric expres-
sions are clearly distinguishable which are not con-
sistently encoded in IWN or in other resources.
Since the necessity of adding corpora as sources
for building computational lexicons is probably
unquestionable, our main point is that one should
deal with these issues by adopting a well estab-
lished and generally accepted theoretical frame-
work like that proposed by Lakoff and Johnson
(1980) and Lakoff (1993), within which a large
system of conventional conceptual metaphors has
been described. By adopting that perspective many
subtle, but relevant, differences may be highlighted
in a principled way (cf. Alonge and Castelli,
2002a; 2002b). These should be encoded in
EWN/IWN at the synset level to account for al-
ready well established word figurative senses. Of
course, no lexical resource will probably ever be
able to exhaustively account for the phenomenon
which Cruse (1986) termed modulation, determin-
ing that “a single sense can be modified in an
unlimited number of ways for different contexts,
each context emphasizing certain semantic traits,
and obscuring and suppressing others” (Cruse,
1986: 52). However, each resource should be de-
signed so to be as complete and coherent as possi-
ble.
A more central issue to be tackled, however, is
that of how to encode information on the system-
atic nature of conceptual metaphors, determining
the possibility to produce and/or understand novel
metaphoric uses of words. When we understand
novel metaphoric expressions we make reference
to a system of established mappings between con-
crete conceptual domains and abstract ones. That
is, there is a pre-existent knowledge which con-
strains our possibility to produce and/or understand
novel metaphoric expressions. For instance, a
group of conventional conceptual metaphors which
characterizes as a subset of the more general
‘CHANGES ARE MOVEMENTS’ metaphor is
the following: ‘BIRTH IS ARRIVAL’, ‘LIFE IS
BEING PRESENT HERE’, ‘DEATH IS
DEPARTURE’ (cf. Lakoff and Johnson, 1980).
Thus, we can say, for instance (examples are ours):
- Nostro figlio è arrivato (= è nato) dopo dieci
anni di matrimonio.
(Our child arrived (= was born) ten years after
our wedding)
- Lui non è più fra noi. (= è morto)
(He is not with us anymore. (= he is dead))
- Se ne è andato (è morto) all’età di venti anni.
(He went away (he died) when he was
twenty.)
In IWN (or in the dictionaries considered) we find
encoded the senses indicated in the examples for
essere and andare but not for arrivare, even if this
sense of the verb is attested (although infrequent)
in the PAROLE corpus:
c. ... di figli ne sono arrivati troppi.
(there arrived too many children).
If we then look for the senses provided for an-
other verb, which we may potentially expect to
display the same regular sense extension of andare
as to die – lasciare (to leave) –, we do not find any
relevant information in our lexical resources as
well, although also this verb metaphoric sense oc-
curs once in our corpus:
d. Mentre scrivo ci ha appena lasciato. La sua
morte...
(While I’m writing he/she has just left us.
His/her death...).
In fact, these metaphoric uses of arrivare and las-
ciare, although not frequent in our corpus (com-
posed of texts taken from newspapers, magazines,
essays, novels, etc), are quite normal in everyday
spoken language.
In order to build a resource which actually ac-
counts for our lexical-conceptual knowledge and
can be used as a resource for NLP, we have to find
a way to encode also knowledge about mappings
between conceptual domains resulting in potential
metaphoric expressions production. This informa-
tion should be encoded at a higher level than the
synset level, since it is information on regular
polysemy affecting whole conceptual domains.
In IWN, as in EWN, we have three fundamental
levels of representation of semantic information:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.938187461538462">
• the synset level, where language-specific
synsets information is encoded;
• the level of the linking to the Interlingual-
Index (ILI – an unstructured list of WN 1.5
synsets) to which synsets from the specific
wordnet point (by means of so-called
‘equivalence-relations’) in order to per-
form the linking between different lan-
guage-specific wordnets;
• the Top Ontology (TO), a hierarchy of
language-independent concepts, reflecting
fundamental semantic distinctions, which
may (or may not) be lexicalised in various

<bodyText confidence="0.994017">
ways, or according to different patterns, in
different languages: via the ILI, all the
concepts in the language specific wordnet
are directly or indirectly (via hyponymy
relations) linked to the TO.7
The figure below exemplifies the relations
among the three levels.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.995421166666667">
7 Note that in EWN/IWN not all the synsets are directly linked
to TO. Actually, only the so-called ‘Base Concepts’ (cf.
Vossen, 1999) are explicitly linked to ILIs connected with Top
Concepts. However, the links to Top Concepts are inherited by
all the other synsets within the wordnets via hyponymy rela-
tions with the Base Concepts.
</footnote>
<figureCaption confidence="0.7865725">
Figure 1. Levels of representation of semantic
information in EWN/IWN
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995564">
Since the distinctions at the level of the TO are
language independent, it is necessary to show
metaphoric regular polysemy found in a specific
language at a different level. Indeed, there are cul-
ture-constrained differences in the metaphor sys-
tem (see, e.g., the differences linked to orientation
reported by Lakoff and Johnson, 1980, determining
for instance that in some cultures the future is in
front of us and in others the future is behind us)
which should receive a representation at some
other level.
In EWN some cases of regular polysemy were
dealt with at the level of the linking of each lan-
guage-specific wordnet with the ILI. Via the ILI
the generalizations over concepts were then pro-
jected to the TO. Generalizations were stated di-
rectly at the level of the ILI and automatically
inherited from all the synsets which in a language-
specific wordnet were linked to the ILI synsets
involved in the generalizations themselves. An
automatically added generalization could be later
manually deleted in case it did not apply to a spe-
cific language (cf. Peters et al., 1998). For in-
stance, the lexeme scuola (school) in Italian has
got (among others) two related senses indicating

one the institution and the other the building. This
is a case of regular polysemy since many words
indicating institutions also indicate buildings in
Italian (as, of course, in other languages). Once the
Italian school-institution and the school-building
synsets were linked to the appropriate synsets in
the ILI, the system automatically added to both
Italian synsets another equivalence link, called
EQ_METONYM, to a kind of ‘composite ILI unit’,
clustering the ‘institution’ and ‘building’ ILI syn-
sets into a coarser-grained sense group. Thus, our
synsets, via the ILI, were linked to tops in the TO
indicating concepts in different domains. A similar
operation was automatically performed for senses
reflecting diathesis alternations for verbs (related
by EQ_DIATHESIS), such as causative and inchoa-
tive pairs. In case a kind of regular polysemy did
not display in our language, the automatically gen-
erated link to the relevant composite ILI unit had
to be manually deleted.
We think that an EQ_METAPHOR relation point-
ing to new composite ILI units should be created to
account for regular metaphoric extensions of
senses in EWN/IWN. Via the ILI links the con-
nection between specific synsets in a language
would also be shown at the TO level as connection
(mapping) between top concepts (linked to differ-
ent conceptual domains). On the other hand, the
mapping at the TO level could be used to infer
which words might potentially display a certain
metaphoric extension, when this is not encoded at
the synset level. Indeed, the link to a Top Concept
is inherited along taxonomies within the language-
specific wordnets, thus all the synsets directly or
indirectly connected (through hyponymy) with an-
other synset would inherit the links to Top Con-
cepts related to different conceptual domains.
Thus, even when specific information on a possible
metaphoric sense extension of a word is not en-
coded in the database it would be possible to de-
rive it. Consider the case of lasciare (to leave),
mentioned above, and related conceptual meta-
phors. This verb has 9 senses in IWN (i.e., it is
found within 9 synsets), one of which (sense 2) is
defined as “andarsene da un luogo temporanea-
mente o definitivamente” (to go away from a place
temporarily or definitively): this verb sense is a
(direct) hyponym of the {partire 1, andare via 1}
synset which, via an equivalence link to the {go,
go away, depart, travel away} ILI synset, is con-
nected with the Top Concepts ‘BoundedEvent’,
indicating change of state; ‘Location’, indicating
that the change referred to is a change of location;
and ‘Physical’, indicating that the change of loca-
tion involves ‘physical entities’. As was done in
EWN for other kinds of sense extensions, a ‘com-
posite ILI unit’ should be created, clustering the
‘departure’ ILI synset (already linked to our {par-
tire 1, andare 1} synset) and the ‘death’ ILI synset
and accounting for the ‘DEATH IS DEPARTURE’
conceptual metaphor: then, the Italian synset al-
ready manually linked to the ‘departure’ ILI synset
would also be connected, through an
EQ_METAPHOR relation, to the ‘death’ ILI synset.8
Consequently, the same synset would be, at the
same time, connected both to the synset(s) indicat-
ing ‘death’ in Italian and to the relevant Top Con-
cepts in the TO. All the hyponyms of {partire 1,
andare via 1} would then inherit these connections;
thus, also lasciare would display the same links,
even if no specific information is encoded at the
synset level. Again, cf. the figure below for a
schematic representation of these relations.

andare via 1}

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999372043478261">
In this paper we have discussed a way to deal with
metaphoric expressions in WN-like databases
which involves: i) a more careful analysis of tex-
tual corpora and the reference to theoretical well-
established views of metaphor to encode more de-
tailed information at the synset level; ii) the exten-
sions of devices already used in EWN in order to
encode information on the mapping between con-
ceptual domains, causing the possibility to have
certain metaphoric sense extensions in a language.
The research on the latter issue needs to be further
carried out; in particular:
- we want to deepen the issue of the weight that
other relations than hyponymy (cf. Alonge et
al., 1998; Roventini et al., forthcoming) have
in order to determine when a concept belongs
to a certain conceptual domain for which
metaphoric sense extensions inherited from
the TO apply;
- we think that the EWN TO should be ex-
tended with more concepts, since at the mo-
ment it only contains very general semantic
distinctions.

<abstract confidence="0.987566375">In this paper we address the issue of the encoding of information on metaphors in a WordNet-like database, i.e. the Italian wordnet in EuroWordNet (ItalWordNet). When analysing corpus data we find a huge number of metaphoric expressions which can be hardly dealt with by using as reference database ItalWordNet. In particular, we have compared information contained both in dictionaries of Italian and in ItalWordNet with actual uses of words found in a corpus. We thus put forward proposals to enrich a resource like ItalWordNet with relevant information.</abstract>

Much research has been devoted at the issues of what a wordsense is and if word-senses ‘exist’ at all and should be considered as the basic units of the lexicon. Although we agree with views according to which “word senses exist only relative to a task” (Kilgarriff, 1997: 1), and are at the same time appealed by proposals for ‘coarse coding’ (Harris, 1994), we still believe that a WN-like structure, taking the concepts and the synsets referring to them as the ‘building blocks’ of the (mental) lexicon, is both appropriate as a representation of lexical knowledge (with the basic idea of a net linking the concepts) and can be used as a resource for NLP, provided that the possible uses and actual limits of such a resource are kept clear.
