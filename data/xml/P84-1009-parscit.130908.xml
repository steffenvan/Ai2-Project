<bodyText confidence="0.999531">
The Institut fUr deutsche Sprache
recently has begun setting up a
LExicographical DAta Base for German
(LEDA). This data base is designed to
improve efficiency in the collection,
analysis, ordering and description of
language material by facilitating access
to textual samples within corpora and to
word articles, within machine readable
dictionaries and by providing a frame to
store results of lexicographical research
for further processing. LEDA thus consists
of the three components Text Bank,
Dictionary Bank and Result Bank and
serves as a tool to suppport monolingual
German dictionary projects at the
Institute and elsewhere.

I INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999846823529412">
Since the foundation of the Institut
fUr deutsche Sprache in 1964, its research
has been based on empirical findings;
samples of language produced in spoken or
written from were the main basis. To
handle efficiently large quantities of
texts to be researched it was necessary to
use a computer, to assemble machine
readable corpora and to develop programs
for corpus analysis. An outline of the
computational activities of the Institute
is given in LDV-Info (1981 ff); the basic
corpora are described in Teubert (1982).
The present main frame computer, which was
installed in January 1983, is a Siemens
7.536 with a core storage of 2 megabytes,
a number of tape and disc decks and at the
moment 15 visual display units for
interactive use.
Whereas in former years most jobs
were carried out in batch, the terminals
now make it possible for the linguist to
work interactively with the computer. It
was therefore a logical step to devise
Lexicographical Data Base for German
(LEDA) as a tool for the compilation of
new dictionaries. The ideology of
interactive use demands a different
concept of programming where the
lexicographer himself can choose from the
menu of alternatives offered by the system
and fix his own search parameters. Work on
the Lexicographical Data Base was begun in
1981; a first version incorporating all
three components is planned to be. ready
for use in 1986.
What is the goal of LEDA? In any
lexicographical project, once the concept
for the new dictionary has been
established, there are three major tasks
where the computer can be employed:
(i) For each lemma, textual samples
have to be determined in the corpus which
is the linguistic base of the dictionary.
The text corpus and the programs to be
applied to it will form one component of
LEDA, namely the Text Bank.
(ii) For each lemma, the lexico-
grapher will want to compare corpus
samples with the respective word articles
of existing relevant dictionaries. For
easy access, these dictionaries should be
transformed into a machine readable corpus
of integrated word articles. Word corpus
and the pertaining retrieval programs will
form the second component, i.e. the
Dictionary Bank.
(iii) Once the formal structure of
the word articles in the new dictionary
has been established, description of the
lemmata within to the framework of this
structure can be begun. A data base system
will provide this frame so that homogenous
and interrelated descriptions can be
carried out by each member of the
dictionary team at all stages of the
compilation. This component of LEDA we
call the Result Bank.

II TEXT BANK

Each dictionary project should make
use of a text corpus assembled to the
specific requirements of the particular
lexicographical goal. As self-evident as
this claim seems to be, it is nonetheless
true for most German monolingual
dictionaries on the market that they have
been compiled without any corpus; this is
apparently even the case for the new six
volume BROCKHAUS-WAHRIG, as has been
pointed out by Wiegand/Kucera (1981 and
1982). For a general dictionary of
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.951974205128206">
contemporary German containing about
200 000 lemmata, the Hamburger Thesen
(1978) asked for a corpus of not less than
50 million words (tokens).
To be used in the text bank, corpora
will have to conform to the special
codification or pre-editing requirements
demanded by the interactive query system.
At present, a number of machine readable
corpora in unified codification are
available at the Institute, including the
Mannheim corpora of contemporary written
language, the Freiburg corpus of spoken
language and the East/West German
newspaper corpus, totalling altogether
about 7 million running words of text.
Further corpora habe been taken over from
other research institutions, publishing
houses and other sources. These texts had
been coded in all kinds, of different
conventions, and programs had to (and
still have to) be develqped to transform
them according to the Mannheim coding
rules. Other texts to be included in the
corpus of the text bank will be recorded
by OCR, via terminal or by use of an
optical scanner, if they are not available
on machine readable data carriers. By the
end of 1985 texts of a total length of 20
million words will be available from which
any dictionary project can make its own
selection.
A special query system called REFER
has been developed and is still being
improved. For a detailed description of
it, see Brackner (1982) and (1984). The
purpose of this system is to ensure quick
access to the data of the text bank, thus
enabling the lexicographer to use the
corpus interactively via the terminal.
Unlike other query programs, REFER does
not search a word form (or a combinantion
of graphemes) in the corpus itself, but in
registers containing all the word forms.
One register is arranged in the usual
alphabetical way, the other is organized
in reverse or a tergo to allow a search
for suffixes or the terminal elements of
compounds. All word forms in the registers
are connected with the references to their
actual occurrence in the corpus, which are
then looked up directly. With REFER, it
normally takes no more than three to five
seconds for the search procedure to be
completed, and all occurrences of the word
form within an arbitrarily chosen context
can be viewed on the screen. Response
behaviour does not depend on the size of
the text bank.
In addition, REFER features the
following options:
- The lexicographer can search for a word
form, for word forms beginning or ending
with a specified string of graphemes or
for word forms containing a specified
string of graphemes at any place.
- The lexicographer can search for any
combination of word forms and/or
graphemic strings to occur within a
single sentence of the corpus.
- REFER is connected with a morphological
generator supplying all inflected forms
for the basic form, e.g. the infinitive
(cf. fahren (inf.) --- fahre, fahrst,
fahrtT—Tart, fuhr, fuhren, fuhrst,
fuhre, fuhren, EIFFst, gefahren)—fr-.1is
will make itmuch easier for the
lexicographer to state his query.
- For all word forms, REFER will provide
information on the relative and absolute
frequency and the distribution over the
texts of the corpus.
- The lexicographer hat a choice of
options for the output. He can view the
search item in the context of a full
sentence, in the context of any number
of sentences or in the form of a
KWIC-Index, both on the screen and in
print.
- For each search procedure, the linguist
can define his own subcorpus from the
complete corpus.
- Lemmatized registers are in preparation.
They will be produced automatically
using a complete dictionary of word
forms with their morphological
descriptions. These lemmatized registers
not only reduce the search time, but
also give the accurate frequency of a
lemma, not just a word form, in the
corpus.
- Register of word classes and
morphological descriptions (e.g. listing
references of all past participles) will
be produced automatically by inverting
the lemmatized registers. Thus the
linguist can search for relevant
grammatical constructions, like all verb
complexes in the passive voice.
- Another feature will permit searching
for an element at a predetermined
sentence position, like all finite verbs
as the first words of a sentence or all
nouns preceded by two adjectives.
Thus the text bank is a tool for the
lexicographer to gain information of the
following kind:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.906247818181818">
- Which word forms of a lemma are found in
the corpus? Are there spelling or
inflectional variations?
- In which meanings and syntactical
constructions is the lemma employed?
- What collocations are there? What
compounds is the lemma part of?
- Is there evidence for idiomatic and
phraseological usuage?
- What is the relative and absolute
frequency of the lemma? Is there a

<bodyText confidence="0.72381275">
characteristic distribution over
different text types?
- Which samples can best be used to
demonstrate the meanings of the lemma?
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999198">
Preliminary versions of the text bank
are in use since 1982. Not only
lexicographers but also grammarians employ
this interactive system to gain the
textual samples they need. A steadily
growing number of service demands both
from members of the Institute and from
linguists at other institutions are being
fulfilled by the text bank.

III DICTIONARY BANK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997743744444445">
If access to the textual samples of a
corpus is an indisputable prerequisite for
successful dictionary compilation,
consultation of other relevant
dictionaries can facilitate the drawing up
of lexical entries. It is virtually
impossible to assemble a corpus so
extensive and encompassing that it will
suffice to describe the whole vocabulary
of a language, even within the limits of
the particular conception of any
dictionary (unless it were a pure corpus
dictionary). A dictionary of contemporary
language should not let down its user if
he is reading a text written in the early
19th century though it will contain words
and meanings of words not found in a
corpus of post World War II texts. This
holds even more for languages for special
purposes; they cannot be described without
recurrence to technical dictionaries,
collections of terminology and thesauri,
because the more or less standardized
meanings cannot be retrieved from their
occurrences in texts.
According to Nagao et al. (1982),
&amp;quot;dictionaries themselves are rich sources,
as linguistic corpora. When dictionary
data is stored in a data base system, the
data can be examined by making cross
references of various viewpoints. This
leads to new discoveries of linguistic
facts which are almost impossible to
achieve in the conventional printed
versions&amp;quot;. A dictionary bank will
therefore form one of the components of
the Lexicographical Data Base.
Since 1979 a team at the Bonn
Institut fUr Kommunikationsforschung und
Phonetik is compiling a &apos;cumulative word
data base for German&apos;, using 11 existing
machine readable dictionaries of various
kinds, including dictionaries assembled
for Artificial Intelligence projects,
machine translation systems and, for
copyright reasons, only two generals
purpose dictionaries. Programs have been
developed to make up for the differences
in the description of lemmata and to
permit automatic cumulation. For further
information regarding this project, see
Hess/Brustkern/Lenders (1983) and
Brustkern/Schulze (1983, 1983a). The
cumulative word data base, which is due to
be completed in 1984, will then be
implemented in Mannheim and form the core
of the dictionary bank of LEDA.
In its final version, the dictionary
bank will provide a fully integrated
cumulation of the source dictionaries,
down to the level of lexical entries,
including statement of word class and
morphosyntactical information. A complete
integration within the microstructure of
the lexical entry, however, seems neither
possible nor even desirable. Automatic
unification cannot be achieved on the
level of semantic and pragmatic
description. Here, the source for each
information item has to be retrievable to
assist the lexicographer in the evulation.
The dictionary bank will be a
valuable tool not only for the
lexicographer but also for the grammarian.
Retrieval programs will make it possible
to come up with a listing of all verbs
with a dative and accusative complement,
or of all nouns belonging to a particular
inflectional class. Since the construction
of the dictionary bank and the result bank
will be related to each other, every time
a new dictionary has been compiled in the
result bank, it can be copied into the
dictionary bank, making it a growing
source of lexical knowledge. The
dictionary bank can then be used as a
master dictionary as defined by Wolfart
(1979), from which derived printed
versions for different purposes can be
produced.

IV RESULT BANK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999862571428571">
Whereas text bank and dictionary bank
supply the lexicographer with linguistic
information, the result bank will be empty
at the beginning of a project; it consists
of a set of forms which are the frames for
the word articles. Into these forms the
lexicographer enters the (often
preliminary) results of his work, which
will be altered, amended or shortened and
interrelated with other word articles
(e.g. via synonymy or antonymy) in the
course of compilation; he copies into
those forms relevant textual samples from
the text bank and useful information units
from the dictionary bank.
Access via terminal is not only
possible to any file representing a word
article but also to any record
representing a category of explication.
The result bank, which can be constructed
within the framework of any standard data
base management system, thus permits
consultation and comparison on any level
of lexical description. Descriptive
uniformity in the morphosyntactical
categories seems easy enough. But as has
been shown in a number of studies, e.g. by
Mugdan (1984), most existing dictionaries
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993695">
36
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955">
abound in discrepancies and inaccuracies
which easily can be avoided by
cross-checking within the result bank.
More difficult is homogeneity in the
semantic description of the vocabulary,
representing a partly hierarchical, Partly
associative net of conceptual relations.
The words used in semantic explications
must be used only in the same sense or
senses in which they are defined under
their respective heard words. These tasks
can be carried out easier within a data
base system. Furthermore, the result bank
will support collecting and comparing the
related elements of groups such us:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.898243285714286">
- all verbs with the same sentence
patterns
- all adjectives used predicatively only
- all &apos;nouns denoting tools
- all words rated as obsolete
- the vocabulary of automobile
engineering.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999858107142857">
Files will differ from word class to
word class, as particles or adverbs cannot
be describend within the same cluster of
categories as nouns or verbs. Similarily,
macrostructure and microstructure will not
be the same for any two dictionaries.
Still categories should be defined in such
a way that the final version of the
dictionary can be copied into the
dictionary bank without additional manual
work.
After the dictionary has been
compiled, it can be used as copy, using
standard editing programs to produce the
printed version directly from the result
bank. At that level, strict formatting is
no longer necessary and should be
abandoned, whereever possible, in favour
to economy of space.
Work on the result bank will begin in
autumn 1984. The pilot version of it will
be applied to the current main dictionary
project of the Institute, i. e. the
&amp;quot;Manual of Hard Words&amp;quot;, which at present
is still in its planning stage. Even in
its initial version, however, LEDA will be
accessible and applicable for other
lexicographical projects as well.

For a detailed description of it, see Brackner (1982) and (1984). The purpose of this system is to ensure quick access to the data of the text bank, thus enabling the lexicographer to use the corpus interactively via the terminal. Unlike other query programs, REFER does not search a word form (or a combinantion of graphemes) in the corpus itself, but in registers containing all the word forms.

All word forms in the registers are connected with the references to their actual occurrence in the corpus, which are then looked up directly.

He can view the search item in the context of a full sentence, in the context of any number of sentences or in the form of a KWIC-Index, both on the screen and in print. - For each search procedure, the linguist can define his own subcorpus from the complete corpus. - Lemmatized registers are in preparation.

Not only lexicographers but also grammarians employ this interactive system to gain the textual samples they need. A steadily growing number of service demands both from members of the Institute and from linguists at other institutions are being fulfilled by the text bank.

For further information regarding this project, see Hess/Brustkern/Lenders (1983) and Brustkern/Schulze (1983, 1983a).

Since the construction of the dictionary bank and the result bank will be related to each other, every time a new dictionary has been compiled in the result bank, it can be copied into the dictionary bank, making it a growing source of lexical knowledge. The dictionary bank can then be used as a master dictionary as defined by Wolfart (1979), from which derived printed versions for different purposes can be produced. IV RESULT BANK Whereas text bank and dictionary bank supply the lexicographer with linguistic information, the result bank will be empty at the beginning of a project; it consists of a set of forms which are the frames for the word articles. Into these forms the lexicographer enters the (often preliminary) results of his work, which will be altered, amended or shortened and interrelated with other word articles (e.g. via synonymy or antonymy) in the course of compilation; he copies into those forms relevant textual samples from the text bank and useful information units from the dictionary bank. Access via terminal is not only possible to any file representing a word article but also to any record representing a category of explication. The result bank, which can be constructed the of any standard data base management system, thus permits consultation and comparison on any level of lexical description. Descriptive uniformity in the morphosyntactical categories seems easy enough. But as has been shown in a number of studies, e.g. by Mugdan (1984), most existing dictionaries 36 abound in discrepancies and inaccuracies which easily can be avoided by cross-checking within the result bank. More difficult is homogeneity in the semantic description of the vocabulary, representing a partly hierarchical, Partly associative net of conceptual relations. The words used in semantic explications must be used only in the same sense or senses in which they are defined under their respective heard words. These tasks can be carried out easier within a data base system. Furthermore, the result bank will support collecting and comparing the related elements of groups such us: all verbs with the same sentence patterns all adjectives used predicatively only all &apos;nouns denoting tools all words rated as obsolete the vocabulary of automobile engineering. Files will differ from word class to word class, as particles or adverbs cannot be describend within the same cluster of categories as nouns or verbs. Similarily, macrostructure and microstructure will not be the same for any two dictionaries. Still categories should be defined in such a way that the final version of the dictionary can be copied into the dictionary bank without additional manual work. After the dictionary has been compiled, it can be used as copy, using standard editing programs to produce the printed version directly from the result bank. At that level, strict formatting is no longer necessary and should be abandoned, whereever possible, in favour to economy of space. Work on the result bank will begin in autumn 1984. The pilot version of it will be applied to the current main dictionary project of the Institute, i. e. the &amp;quot;Manual of Hard Words&amp;quot;, which at present is still in its planning stage. Even in its initial version, however, LEDA will be accessible and applicable for other lexicographical projects as well. REFERENCES Bruckner. Dokumentation Version 1.LDV-Info 2.

A dictionary of contemporary language should not let down its user if he is reading a text written in the early 19th century though it will contain words and meanings of words not found in a corpus of post World War II texts. This holds even more for languages for special purposes; they cannot be described without recurrence to technical dictionaries, collections of terminology and thesauri, because the more or less standardized meanings cannot be retrieved from their occurrences in texts. According to Nagao et al. (1982), &amp;quot;dictionaries themselves are rich sources, as linguistic corpora. When dictionary data is stored in a data base system, the data can be examined by making cross references of various viewpoints. This leads to new discoveries of linguistic facts which are almost impossible to achieve in the conventional printed versions&amp;quot;. A dictionary bank will therefore form one of the components of the Lexicographical Data Base.
