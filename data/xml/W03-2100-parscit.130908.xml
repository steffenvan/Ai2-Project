We would like to thank SIGdial, the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, and SLUD, the
Special Interest Group on Spoken Language Understanding and Discourse Processing of the Japanese
Society for Artificial Intelligence, for providing assistance in the organization of this workshop. We
would like to in particular acknowledge the financial support that the Workshop has received from the
following organizations: the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence, Support Center for Advanced
Telecommunications Technology Research, International Communications Foundation, Inoue Commu-
nications Foundation and Sapporo International Communication Plaza Foundation.
The preparations for the Workshop would have been more difficult without the valuable advice and
guidance provided by Laila Dybkjær and David Traum. For this we thank them. We would also like
to thank the members of the program committee for their willingness to review papers and to the invited
speaker for his participation. Finally, we thank the staffs of the Sapporo Convention Center and the
Sapporo Industries Cultivation Center for their special assistance in arranging the meeting place.
