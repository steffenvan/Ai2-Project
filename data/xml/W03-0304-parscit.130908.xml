This article presents a method for aligning
words between translations, that imposes a
compositionality constraint on alignments pro-
duced with statistical translation models. Ex-
periments conducted within the WPT-03 shared
task on word alignment demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of the proposed approach.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972264705882">
Since the pioneering work of the IBM machine trans-
lation team almost 15 years ago (Brown et al., 1990),
statistical methods have proven to be valuable tools in
approaching the automation of translation. Word align-
ments (WA) play a central role in the statistical modeling
process, and reliable WA techniques are crucial in acquir-
ing the parameters of the models (Och and Ney, 2000).
Yet, the very nature of these alignments, as defined in
the IBM modeling approach (Brown et al., 1993), lead
to descriptions of the correspondences between source-
language (SL) and target-language (TL) words of a trans-
lation that are often unsatisfactory, at least from a human
perspective.
One notion that is typically evacuated in the statisti-
cal modeling process is that of compositionality: a fun-
damental assumption in statistical machine translation is
that, ultimately, all the words of a SL segment S con-
tribute to produce all the words of its TL translation T, at
least to some degree. While this makes perfect sense from
a stochastic point of view, it contrasts with the hypothesis
at the basis of most (if not all) other MT approaches, as
well as with our natural intuitions about translation: that
individual portions of the SL text produce individual TL
portions autonomously, and that the final translation T is
obtained by somehow piecing together these TL portions.
In what follows, we show how re-integrating compo-
sitionality into the statistical translation word alignment
process leads to better alignments. We first take a closer
look at the “standard” statistical WA techniques in section
2, and then propose a way of imposing a compositional-
ity constraint on these techniques in section 3. In section
4, we discuss various implementation issues, and finally
present the experimental results of this approach on the
WPT-03 shared task on WA in section 5.

2 Statistical Word Alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9931146">
Brown et al. (1993) define a word alignment as a vec-
tor a = a1...am that connects each word of a source-
language text S = s1...sm to a target-language word in
its translation T = t1...tn, with the interpretation that
word tai is the translation of word sj in S (aj = 0 is
used to denote words of s that do not produce anything in
T).
The Viterbi alignment between source and target sen-
tences S and T is defined as the alignment aˆ whose prob-
ability is maximal under some translation model:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.994888">
aˆ = argmaxa∈APrM(a|S, T)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999094">
where A is the set of all possible alignments between S
and T, and PrM(a|S, T) is the estimate of a’s probabil-
ity under model M, which we denote Pr(a|S,T) from
hereon. In general, the size of A grows exponentially
with the sizes of S and T, and so there is no efficient way
of computing aˆ efficiently. However, under the indepen-
dence hypotheses of IBM Model 2, the Viterbi alignment
can be obtained by simply picking for each position i in
S, the alignment that maximizes t(si|tj)a(j, i, m, n), the
product of the model’s “lexical” and “alignment” proba-
bility estimates. This procedure can trivially be carried
out in O(mn) operations. Because of this convenient
property, we take the Viterbi-2 WA method (which we
later refer to as the V method) as the basis for the rest of
this work.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.994139" genericHeader="method">
3 Compositionality
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999070846153846">
In IBM-style alignments, each SL token is connected to a
single (possibly null) TL token, typically the TL token
with which it has the most “lexical affinities”, regard-
less of other existing connections in the alignment and,
more importantly, of the relationships it holds with other
SL tokens in its vicinity. In practice, this means that
some TL tokens can end up being connected to several
SL tokens, while other TL tokens are left unconnected.
This contrasts with alternative alignment models such as
those of Melamed (1998) and Wu (1997), which impose a
“one-to-one” constraint on alignments. Such a constraint
evokes the notion of compositionality in translation: it
suggests that each SL token operates independently in the
SL sentence to produce a single TL token in the TL sen-
tence, which then depends on no other SL token.
This view is, of course, extreme, and real-life transla-
tions are full of examples that show how this composi-
tionality principle breaks down as we approach the level
of word correspondences. Yet, if we can find a way of
imposing compositionality constraints on WA’s, at least
to the level where it applies, then we should obtain more
sensible results than with Viterbi alignments.
For instance, consider a procedure that splits both the
SL and TL sentences S and T into two independent parts,
in such a way as to maximise the probability of the two
resulting Viterbi alignments:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9804346">
d = 1 : Pr(a1|si1, tj1)
xPr(a2|smi+1,tnj+1)
d = −1 : Pr(a1|si1, tnj+1).
xPr(a2|sim+1, ti)
(1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987660828571429">
In the triple (i, j, d) above, i represents a “split point”
in the SL sentence S, j is the analog for TL sentence T,
and d is the “direction of correspondence”: d = 1 denotes
a “parallel correspondence”, i.e. s1...si corresponds to
t1...tj and si+1...sm corresponds to tj+1...tn; d = −1
denotes a “crossing correspondence”, i.e. s1...si corre-
sponds to tj+1...tn and si+1...sm corresponds to t1...tj.
The triple (I, J, D) produced by this procedure refers
to the most probable alignment between S and T, un-
der the hypothesis that both sentences are made up of
two independent parts (s1...sI and sI+1...sm on the one
hand, t1...tJ and tJ+1...tn on the other), that correspond
to each other two-by-two, following direction D. Such
an alignment suggests that translation T was obtained
by “composing” the translation of s1...sI with that of
sI+1...sm.
In the above procedure, these “composing parts” of
S and T are further assumed to be contiguous sub-
sequences of words. Once again, real-life translations are
full of examples that contradict this (negations in French
and particle verbs in German are two examples that im-
mediately spring to mind when aligning with English).
Yet, this contiguity assumption turns out to be very con-
venient, because examining pairings of non-contiguous
sequences would quickly become intractable. In con-
trast, the procedure above can find the optimal partition
in polynomial time.
The “splitting” process described above can be re-
peated recursively on each pair of matching segments,
down to the point where the SL segment contains a sin-
gle token. (TL segments can always be split, even when
empty, because IBM-style alignments allow connecting
SL tokens to the “null” TL token, which is always avail-
able.) This recursive procedure actually produces two
different outputs:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.882230090909091">
1. A parallel partition of S and T into m pairs of seg-
ments (si, tkj), where each tkj is a (possibly null)
contiguous sub-sequence of T; this partition can of
course be viewed as an alignment on the words of S
and T.
2. an IBM-style alignment, such that each SL and TL
token is linked to at most one token in the other lan-
guage: this alignment is actually the concatenation
of individual Viterbi alignments on the (si, tkj) pairs,
which connects each si to (at most) one of the tokens
in the corresponding tkj.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97475884">
In this procedure, which we call Compositional WA (or
C for short), there are at least two problems. First, each
SL token finds itself “isolated” in its own partition bin,
which makes it impossible to account for multiple SL to-
kens acting together to produce a TL sequence. Second,
the TL tokens that are not connected in the resulting IBM-
style alignment do not play any role in the computation
of the probability of the optimal alignment; therefore, the
pair (si, tkj) in which these “superfluous” tokens end up
is more or less random.
To compensate in part for these, we propose using
two IBM-2 models to compute the optimal partition: the
“forward” (SL→TL) model, and the “reverse” (TL→SL)
model. When examining a particular split (i, j, d) for S
and T, we compute both Viterbi alignments, forward and
reverse, between all pairs of segments, and score each
pair with the product of the two alignments’ probabili-
ties.
In this variant, which we call Combined Compositional
WA (CC), we can no longer allow “empty” segments in
the TL, and so we stop the recursion as soon as either the
SL or TL segment contains a single token. The resulting
partition therefore consists in a series of 1-to-k or k-to-1
alignments, with k &gt; 1.

4 Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908774193549">
The C and CC WA methods of section 3 were imple-
mented in a program called ralign (Recursive – or RALI
– alignment, as you wish). As suggested above, this pro-
gram takes as input a pair of sentence-aligned texts, and
the parameters of two IBM-2 models (forward and re-
verse), and outputs WA’s for the given texts. This pro-
gram also implements plain Viterbi alignments, using the
forward (V) or reverse (RV) models, as well as what we
call the Reverse compositional WA (or RC), which is just
the C method using the reverse IBM-2 model.
The output format proposed for the WPT-03 shared
task on WA allowed participants to distinguish between
“sure” (S) and “probable” (P) WA’s. We figured that our
alignment procedure implicitly incorporated a way of dis-
tinguishing between the two: within each produced pair
of segments, we marked as “sure” all WA’s that were pre-
dicted by both (forward and reverse) Viterbi alignments,
and as “probable” all the others.
The translation models for ralign were trained using
the programs of the EGYPT statistical translation toolkit
(Al-Onaizan et al., 1999). This training was done using
the data provided as part of the WPT-03 shared task on
WA (table 1). We thus produced two sets of models, one
for English and French (en-Jr), and one for Romanian
and English (ro-en). All models were trained on both the
training and test datasets1. For en-Jr, we considered all
words that appeared only once in the corpus to be “un-
known words” (whittle option -f 2), so as to obtain de-
fault values of “real” unknowns in the test corpus2. In the
case of ro-en, there was too little training data for this to
be beneficial, and so we chose to use all words.

5 Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986682926829">
The different word-alignment methods described in sec-
tions 2 and 3 were run on the test corpora of the WPT-
03 shared task on alignment. Results were evaluated in
terms of alignment precision (P), recall (R), F-measure
and alignment error rate (AER) (Och and Ney, 2000). As
specified in the shared task description, all of these met-
rics were computed taking null-alignments into account
(i.e. tokens left unconnected in an alignment were actu-
ally counted as aligned to virtual word token “0”). The
results of our experiments are reproduced in table 2.
We observe that imposing a “contiguous composition-
ality” constraint (C and RC methods) allows for sub-
stantial gains with regard to plain Viterbi alignments (V
and RV respectively), especially in terms of precision
and AER (a slight decline in recall can be observed be-
tween the V and C methods on the ro-en corpus, but it
is not clear whether this is significant). These gains are
even more interesting when one considers that all pairs of
alignments (V and C, RV and RC) are obtained using ex-
actly the same data. This highlights both the deficiencies
of IBM Model-2 and the importance of compositionality.
Using both the forward and reverse models (CC) yields
yet more gains with regard to all metrics. This result is
interesting, because it shows the potential of the compo-
sitional alignment method for integrating various sources
of information.
With regard to language pairs, it is interesting to note
that all alignment methods produce figures that are sub-
stantially better in recall and worse in precision on the ro-
en data, compared to en-Jr. Overall, ro-en alignments dis-
play significantly higher F-measures. This is surprising,
considering that the provided en-Jr corpus contained 20
times more training material. This phenomenon is likely
due to the fact that the en-Jr test reference contains much
more alignments per word (1.98 per target word) than the
ro-en (1.12). All alignment methods described here pro-
duce roughly between 1 and 1.25 alignments per target
words. This fact affects recall and F-measure figures pos-
itively on the ro-en test, while precision and AER (which
correlates strongly with precision in practice) are affected
inversely.

In this article, we showed how a compositionality con-
straint could be imposed when computing word align-
ments with IBM Models-2. Our experiments on the WPT-
03 shared task on WA demonstrated how this improves
the quality of resulting alignments, when compared to
standard Viterbi alignments. Our results also highlight

the benefit of using both forward and reverse translation
models for this task.
One of the weaknesses of the proposed method is the
inability to produce many-to-many alignments. To allow
for such alignments, it would be necessary to establish a
“stopping condition” on the recursion process, so as to
prevent partitioning pairs of segments that display “non-
compositional” phenomena in both SL and TL languages.
We have begun experimenting with various such mecha-
nisms. One of these is to stop the recursion as soon as the
pair of segments under consideration contains less than
two “sure” alignments, i.e. connections predicted by both
the forward and reverse models. Another possibility is to
establish a threshold on the probability “drop” incurred
by the optimal split on any given pair of segments. So
far, these experiments are inconclusive.
Another problem is with “null” alignments, which the
program is also unable to account for. Currently, omis-
sions and insertions in translation find themselves incor-
porated into aligned segments. A simple way to deal with
this problem would be to exclude from the final alignment
links that are not predicted by either the forward or re-
verse Viterbi alignments. But early experiments with this
approach are unconvincing, and more elaborate filtering
mechanisms will probably be necessary.
Finally, IBM Model 2 is certainly not the state of the
art in statistical translation modeling. Thenagain, the
methods proposed here are not dependent on the underly-
ing translation model, and similar WA methods could be
based on more elaborate models, such as Models 3–5, or
the HMM-based models proposed by Och et al. (1999)
for example. On the other hand, our compositional align-
ment method could be used during the training process
of higher-level models. Whether this would lead to better
estimates of the models’ parameters remains to be seen,
but it is certainly a direction worth exploring.
