We present a proposal for the structure

Nesson and Shieber (2006) showed how a now-
standard variant of the tree-adjoining grammar
(TAG) formalism (multi-component, multiple ad-
junction, finite-feature-based TAG), when synchro-
nized, leads to a natural analysis of the syntax-
semantics relation, including handling of syntactic
movement phenomena such as wh questions and rel-
ativization, semantic “movement” phenomena such
as quantification, quantifier scope ambiguity, and
even their interactions as found in pied-piped rela-
tive clauses.1 phenomena were previously viewed

as problematic for TAG analyses, leading to the hy-
pothesizing of various extensions to the TAG for-
malism (Kallmeyer and Romero, 2004, and work
cited therein). Independently, Han (2006a) devel-
oped a similar synchronous TAG analysis of pied-
piping, providing evidence for the naturalness of the
analysis.
Here, we update the analyses of noun phrases
found in the previous works in one simple way,
again with no additional formal TAG innovations,
and show that it allows a further coverage of extrac-
tion and quantification phenomena as well as in-situ
wh-phrases and topicalization. We emphasize that
no novel formal devices are postulated to achieve
this increased coverage —just a simple, natural and
uniform change to the canonical structure of NPs
and their semantics.
A word may be useful on the pertinence of this
work in a workshop on “syntax and structure in ma-
chine translation”, above and beyond the intrinsic
importance of exploring the “applications of [syn-
chronous/transduction grammars] to related areas
including... formal semantics” underlying the work-
shop. Tree-structured mappings are advocated for
machine translation systems because they allow for
the expression of generalizations about relationships
between languages more accurately and effectively.
Evidence for this benefit ought to be found in the
ability of the formalisms to characterize the primi-
tive linguistic relationships as well, in particular, the
form-meaning relationship for a natural language.
The present work is part of a general program to
explore the suitability of synchronous grammars for
expressing this primary linguistic relationship. Inso-

far as it is successful, it lends credence to the use of
these formal tools for a variety of language process-
ing tasks, including MT. Insofar as it reveals insuffi-
ciencies in the formalism, it may lead to insights in
the design or deployment of alternative systems.
We present a proposal for the structure of noun
phrases in Synchronous Tree-Adjoining Grammar
(STAG) syntax and semantics that permits an elegant
and uniform analysis of a variety of phenomena, in-
cluding quantifier scope and extraction phenomena
such as wh-questions with both moved and in-situ
wh-words, pied-piping, stranding of prepositions,
and topicalization. Furthermore, the tight coupling
between syntax and semantics enforced by grammar
synchronization helps to illuminate the critical rela-
tionships and filter out analyses that may be appeal-
ing for either syntax or semantics alone but do not
allow for a meaningful relationship between them.
We begin in Section 2 with a brief review of syn-
chronous TAG and its application to English syntax
and semantics. In Section 3, we present an analysis
of quantifier scope that elucidates the relationship
between the syntactic and semantic structures and
explains an anomaly of previously proposed analy-
ses. We apply the underlying idea from Section 3
to wh-questions in Section 4, showing that an al-
teration of the standard TAG syntax analysis of wh-
questions produces the same derived trees while also
elegantly modeling in-place wh-words. In Section 5
we present a challenging case for STAG syntax and
semantics, the stranding of prepositions. This case
is particularly difficult because the syntactic analy-
ses suggested by previous work in STAG syntax do
not encapsulate the relationships that appear neces-
sary for the semantics. Our proposed analysis falls
out naturally from the revision to the syntax of wh-
words and respects both Frank’s Condition on Ele-
mentary Tree Minimality (CETM) and the seman-
tic relationships in the construction. In Section 6
we give an analysis of topicalization that also fol-
lows from the underlying ideas of the earlier analy-
ses. We summarize the main ideas of the analysis in
Section 7.

A tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) consists of a
set of elementary tree structures of arbitrary depth,

<bodyText confidence="0.999283875">
which are combined with two operations, substitu-
tion and adjunction. Internal nodes in the elementary
trees are labeled with a nonterminal symbol. Fron-
tier nodes may be labeled with either terminal sym-
bols or nonterminal symbols annotated with one of
the diacritics 1 or *. The 1 diacritic marks a frontier
nonterminal node as a substitution node, the target
of the substitution operation. The substitution op-
eration occurs when an elementary tree rooted in a
nonterminal symbol A replaces a substitution node
with the same nonterminal symbol.
Auxiliary trees are elementary trees in which the
root and a frontier node, called the foot node and
distinguished by the diacritic *, are labeled with the
same nonterminal A. The adjunction operation in-
volves splicing an auxiliary tree in at an internal
node in an elementary tree also labeled with non-
terminal A. Trees without a foot node, intended for
substitution rather than adjunction into other trees,
are called initial trees. Examples of the substitu-
tion and adjunction operations on sample elemen-
tary trees are shown in Figure 1. For further infor-
mation, refer to Joshi and Schabes (1997).
Synchronous TAG (Shieber, 1994; Shieber and
Schabes, 1990) extends TAG by taking the elemen-
tary structures to be pairs of TAG trees with links
between particular nodes in those trees. Derivation
proceeds as in TAG except that all operations must
be paired. That is, a tree can only be substituted or
adjoined at a node if its pair is simultaneously sub-
stituted or adjoined at a linked node. We notate the
links by using boxed indices i marking linked nodes.

As first described by Shieber and Schabes (1990),
STAG can be used to provide a semantics for a TAG
syntactic analysis by taking the tree pairs to repre-
sent a syntactic analysis synchronized with a seman-
tic analysis.
For example, Figure 2(a) contains a sample En-
glish syntax/semantics grammar fragment that can
be used to analyze the sentence “John apparently
likes Mary”. The node labels we use in the seman-
tics correspond to the semantic types of the phrases
they dominate.
Figure 2(c) shows the derivation tree for the sen-
tence. Substitutions are notated with a solid line and
adjunctions are notated with a dashed line. Each link
in the derivation tree specifies a link number in the
elementary tree pair, providing the location at which
the operations take place. In this case, the tree pairs
for the noun phrases John and Mary substitute into
the likes tree pair at links 3 and 4, respectively. The
word apparently adjoins at link 2. The tree pair so
derived is shown in Figure 2(b). The resulting se-
mantic representation can be read off the right-hand
derived tree by treating the leftmost child of a node
as a functor and its siblings as its arguments. Our
sample sentence thus results in the semantic repre-
sentation apparently(likes( john,mary)).

3 Quantifier Scope
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999369071428572">
We start by reviewing the prior approach to quan-
tifier semantics in synchronous TAG. Consider the
sentence “Everyone likes someone.” We would like
to allow both the reading where some takes scope
over every and the reading where every takes scope
over some. We start with the proposal of Shieber and
Schabes (1990), which used multi-component TAG
for the semantic portion of a synchronous TAG.
Each quantified noun phrase has a two-component
tree set as its semantics. One component introduces
the variable quantified over in the scope of the quan-
tifier; the other adjoins over the scope to provide the
quantifier and restriction. Williford (1993) explored
the use of multiple adjunction (Schabes and Shieber,
1993) to achieve scope ambiguity. Since the scope
components of subject and object noun phrases
adjoin at the same location in the semantic tree,
they give rise to a systematic ambiguity as to which
dominates the other in the derived tree, reflecting
the semantic scope ambiguity of the sentence; the
derivation tree itself is therefore a scope neutral
representation. Previous work by Han (2006a;
2006b) and Nesson and Shieber (2006) describe
this approach in detail, showing its applicability to
a range of semantic phenomena.
A range of research has proceeded in an alter-
native line of using complex-feature-based TAG —
rather than synchronous TAG — for TAG seman-
tics (Kallmeyer and Romero, 2004, and work cited
therein). Semantic representations are carried in fea-
tures associated with nodes. Nonetheless, multi-
component TAG with separate trees for bound po-
sition and scope is used here too. However, the two
trees are syntactic trees, the quantified NP tree and a
vestigial S tree, respectively. (An example is shown
in Figure 6.) In such analyses, the single-node aux-
iliary S tree is used for the scope part of the syntax
in order to get the desired relationship between the
quantifier and the quantified expression in features
threaded through the derivation tree and hence in the
semantics.
The present analysis marries these two ap-

proaches. Like the previous STAG work, we pro-
pose a solution in which a multi-component tree set
provides semantics for quantified phrases, with mul-
tiple adjunction providing scope ambiguity. Like
the complex-feature-based approach, we reflect the
multi-component structure in the syntax as well. It
is this single change in the analysis that makes pos-
sible the coverage of the wide range of phenomena
we describe here.
Combining these two approaches, we give both
the syntactic and semantic trees for quantifiers two
parts, as depicted in Figure 3(a). In the semantics,
the top part corresponds to the scope of the quan-
tifier and attaches where the quantifier takes scope.
The bottom part corresponds to the bound variable
of the quantifier. By multiply adjoining the scope
parts of the semantic trees of the quantifiers at the
same location in the likes tree, we generate both
available scope readings of the sentence.2 Corre-
spondingly on the syntax side, an NP tree provides
the content of the noun phrase with a vestigial S tree
available as well. Prior to the analyses given in this
paper, the use of two trees in the quantifier syntax
was an arbitrary stipulation used to make the seman-
tic analysis possible. The pairing of the upper tree

nation of the multiple-adjunction-driven approach to scope neu-
trality in STAG.
in the syntax with the scope tree in the semantics
explicitly demonstrates their relationship and leads
naturally to the exploration of non-degenerate upper
trees in the syntax that we explore in this paper.
In order to use these multi-component quantifiers,
we change the links in the elementary trees for verbs
to allow a single link to indicate two positions in
the syntax and semantics where a tree pair can ad-
join, as shown in Figure 3(a). We add four-way
links and drop the two-way links used by the un-
quantified noun phrases in the first example. This
choice forces all noun phrase tree pairs to be multi-
component in the syntax and semantics. Essentially,
all noun phrases are “lifted” a` la Montague. We ex-
plore the consequences of this in Section 6.
We turn now to the ramifications of this new
syntactico-semantic STAG representation, showing
its utility for a range of phenomena.

The structure we propose for quantifiers suggests a
new possibility for the TAG analysis of wh-words.
We propose to simply treat wh-words as regular
noun phrases by making them a multi-component
tree set with an auxiliary tree that adjoins at the root
of the verb tree and contains the lexical content and
an initial tree with an empty frontier that substitutes
at the argument position. This syntactic tree set can

be paired with a multi-component semantic tree set
that has an auxiliary tree containing the scope part
and an initial tree that contains the bound variable.
Wh-questions with the wh-word in place can be ele-
gantly modeled with an alternative syntactic tree set
in which the auxiliary tree has no lexical content and
the wh-word is on the frontier of the initial tree that
substitutes into the argument position. The seman-
tic tree sets for both syntactic variations is the same.
These trees are shown in Figure 4.
Besides the incorporation of a semantics, the ba-
sic analyses for wh-questions familiar from TAG
syntax are otherwise unchanged because the top
piece of the syntax tree set still ends up at the root of
the main verb in sentences such as the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.799277090909091">
(1) Who likes Mary?
who(x,likes(mary,x))
(2) Which person does John like?3
which(x, person(x),likes(x, john))
3The presence of do-support in wh-questions can be handled
independently using a feature on the NP node into which the
bottom part of the wh-word tree pair substitutes that governs
whether and where a do tree adjoins.
(3) Which person does Bill think John likes?
which(x, person(x),thinks(bill,likes(x, john)))
(4) Who does each person like?

<bodyText confidence="0.97565065625">
who(x,each(y, person(y),likes(x,y)))
each(y, person(y),who(x,likes(x,y)))
Note that in Sentence 3 thinks is not constrained
to appear to the right of who in the syntax, because
thinks and who both adjoin at the same location in
the syntax. However, we can use a feature to force
embedding verbs to adjoin lower than wh-words.
The same situation exists in Sentence 4, though only
in the semantics; the order of words in the syntax
is well-defined but the multiple adjunction of the
scope of who and the scope of each underspecifies
the scope ordering between them. Both scope or-
derings are indeed arguably valid. Again, the pref-
erences for certain orderings can be regulated us-
ing a feature. These issues highlight the many open
questions about how to combine quantification and
wh-terms, but also provides a first step towards their
analysis within a concise STAG construction.
Our approach has several distinct advantages.
First, it allows wh-words to be analyzed in a way that
is uniform with the analysis of other noun phrases
and allows us to simplify the lexical entries for
verbs. In the traditional TAG analysis, wh-words
substitute into specialized lexical trees for verbs that
add an additional frontier node for the wh-word and
abstract over one of the arguments of the verb by
adding an empty terminal node at the frontier. Our
revision to the elementary trees for wh-words allows
us to remove several tree pairs from the elementary
tree sets for verbs such as like. Instead of requir-
ing an elementary tree pair for declarative sentences
and an additional elementary tree for each argument

Second, it provides a simple and elegant char-
acterization of the syntax and semantics of wh-
movement and the relationship between fronted and
in-place wh-words. Using the alternative syntax tree
set given in Figure 4 we model in-place use of wh-

Sentence 6 presents a particularly challenging case
for TAG semantics. The problem arises because who
must contribute its bound variable, x, to the noun
phrase “a picture of x”. However, in the standard
syntactic analysis who substitutes into the likes tree,
and in any reasonable semantic analysis, who takes
scope at the root of the likes tree.

Kallmeyer and Scheffler (2004) propose a syntac-
tic analysis in which “a picture of” adjoins into the
syntactic tree for “likes”. The syntax for this anal-
ysis is shown for comparison in Figure 6. As-
sociated with the syntactic analysis is a semantic
analysis, which differs from ours in that all of the
semantic computation is accomplished by use of
a flexible set of features that are associated with
nodes in the syntactic trees. This analysis main-
tains Frank’s Constraint on Elementary Tree Min-
imality (CETM) if one analyzes the prepositional
phrase as a complement of picture but it does so at
the expense of a straightforward compositional se-
mantics.4 The source of the problem is that who
contributes its bound variable to likes to form an
intermediate semantics who(x,likes(john,x)), then
a picture of combines non-compositionally to form
the complete semantics given in Sentence 6.
Kroch (1989) describes the intuition eschewing
this analysis: “The problem is that under such a
derivation, the preposed wh-phrase changes its the-
matic role with each adjunction and the interpreta-
tion of the derived tree is not a simple function of the
interpretations of its component elementary trees.”
When we consider the semantics of the two sen-
tences, the anomaly of this analysis becomes appar-
ent. In the first sentence the entity liked by John is
referred to by the variable contributed by who. In the
second sentence John likes an entirely different en-
tity: the entity referred to by the variable contributed
by a. Kallmeyer and Scheffler obtain the correct se-
mantics by making use of non-local TAG operations
to have the scope part of a adjoin into likes to cap-
ture the semantics of the likes proposition and em-
ploying a feature-based mechanism for swapping the
variables as necessary.
Our revision to the syntax of wh-words provides
an alternative way of maintaining the CETM that of-
fers a much simpler semantic analysis. The details
of the analysis are given in Figure 7. We adjoin who
into the preposition of at link 1 where it contributes
both variable and scope. The tree pair for of at-
taches to a at link 1, thus allowing the scope parts
of the quantifier a and the wh-word who to end up
taking scope over the main verb as in the analysis of
prepositional phrases given by Nesson and Shieber
(2006). It also places all the bound variables in the
correct propositions without use of non-local opera-
tions or additional manipulation. A diagram of the
derived syntax and semantics is given in Figure 8.

4In addition to suggesting a non-compositional seman-
tics, their syntactic analysis makes use of non-local multi-
component TAG in order to achieve the necessary semantic rela-
tionships. Although their use of non-local TAG may be benign
in terms of complexity, our analysis is set-local. Our proposal
therefore simplifies the syntactic analysis while also bringing it
in line with a straightforward, compositional semantics.

The insight that allows us to model in-place wh-
words extends to an elegant analysis of topicaliza-
tion as well. The vestigial S* tree that we added
to the tree set for the syntax of every noun phrase
need not always be contentless. Just as we moved
the wh-word who from the top tree in its set to the
bottom tree to model in-situ wh-words, we can move
the lexical content of noun phrases to the top tree in
their sets to model topicalization. For instance, the
alternative tree pair for Mary shown in Figure 9 pro-
vides for an analysis of the sentence
(7) Mary, John likes.

In this paper we have proposed a uniform change

syntactico-semantic grammar. The formal tools we
avail ourselves of comprise synchronous TAG with

set-local multicomponent adjunction and multiple
adjunction. Nothing more is required.
All noun phrases now have a uniform multi-
component structure in both the syntax and the
semantics. In the semantics the top part corresponds
to the scope-giving piece provided by the noun
phrase and the bottom part to the bound variable
or simple noun-phrase meaning. In the syntax, the
top part corresponds to the lexical material that
should appear moved to the edge of the sentence or
clause; the bottom part corresponds to the lexical
material that will fill an argument position of some
head. By moving lexical material among the pieces
of the multi-component set in the syntax, we can
simply model phenomena like in-place wh-words
and topicalization.
Making the top parts of wh-word tree sets into
auxiliary trees allows them to adjoin not just to the
main verb but also to heads of modifying clauses,
such as prepositional phrases. This allows us to
handle more complex sentences like Sentence 6
without violating either the CETM or going beyond
simple compositional semantics. In order to allow
the scope-giving part of the wh-word to percolate
up to the root of the semantics of the main verb,
each tree set that it adjoins into on its way must
also have a scope part in the semantics to which
it can adjoin. Scope carriers, such as prepositions,
are therefore also multi-component in the semantics
with a top node to which scope-givers can adjoin.
One nice property of this analysis is that it predicts
the observed facts about disallowed scope orderings
in sentences that have three quantifiers, one of
which is in a modifying clause. The scope part of
the quantifier of the modified clause and the scope
part of the quantifier of the modifying clause form
an indivisible set as the derivation proceeds so that
when they adjoin multiply with the scope part of the
unmodified clause, that quantifier cannot intervene
between them.
Our synchronous grammar treatment of the
syntax-semantic relation with TAG is at least as
simple and arguably more accurate than previous
TAG proposals, offering treatments of such phe-
nomena as in-situ wh-words, stranded prepositions,
and topicalization.

Auxiliary trees are elementary trees in which the root and a frontier node, called the foot node and distinguished by the diacritic *, are labeled with the same nonterminal A. The adjunction operation involves splicing an auxiliary tree in at an internal node in an elementary tree also labeled with nonterminal A. Trees without a foot node, intended for substitution rather than adjunction into other trees, are called initial trees. Examples of the substitution and adjunction operations on sample elementary trees are shown in Figure 1. For further information, refer to Joshi and Schabes (1997). Synchronous TAG (Shieber, 1994; Shieber and Schabes, 1990) extends TAG by taking the elementary structures to be pairs of TAG trees with links between particular nodes in those trees. Derivation proceeds as in TAG except that all operations must be paired. That is, a tree can only be substituted or adjoined at a node if its pair is simultaneously substituted or adjoined at a linked node. We notate the links by using boxed indices i marking linked nodes.

Our revision to the syntax of wh-words provides an alternative way of maintaining the CETM that offers a much simpler semantic analysis. The details of the analysis are given in Figure 7. We adjoin who into the preposition of at link 1 where it contributes both variable and scope. The tree pair for of attaches to a at link 1, thus allowing the scope parts of the quantifier a and the wh-word who to end up taking scope over the main verb as in the analysis of prepositional phrases given by Nesson and Shieber (2006). It also places all the bound variables in the correct propositions without use of non-local operations or additional manipulation. A diagram of the derived syntax and semantics is given in Figure 8. 4In addition to suggesting a non-compositional semantics, their syntactic analysis makes use of non-local multicomponent TAG in order to achieve the necessary semantic relationships. Although their use of non-local TAG may be benign in terms of complexity, our analysis is set-local. Our proposal therefore simplifies the syntactic analysis while also bringing it in line with a straightforward, com</context>

We start with the proposal of Shieber and Schabes (1990), which used multi-component TAG for the semantic portion of a synchronous TAG. Each quantified noun phrase has a two-component tree set as its semantics. One component introduces the variable quantified over in the scope of the quantifier; the other adjoins over the scope to provide the quantifier and restriction. Williford (1993) explored the use of multiple adjunction (Schabes and Shieber, 1993) to achieve scope ambiguity. Since the scope components of subject and object noun phrases adjoin at the same location in the semantic tree, they give rise to a systematic ambiguity as to which dominates the other in the derived tree, reflecting the semantic scope ambiguity of the sentence; the derivation tree itself is therefore a scope neutral representation. Previous work by Han (2006a; 2006b) and Nesson and Shieber (2006) describe this approach in detail, showing its applicability to a range of semantic phenomena.

The adjunction operation involves splicing an auxiliary tree in at an internal node in an elementary tree also labeled with nonterminal A. Trees without a foot node, intended for substitution rather than adjunction into other trees, are called initial trees. Examples of the substitution and adjunction operations on sample elementary trees are shown in Figure 1. For further information, refer to Joshi and Schabes (1997). Synchronous TAG (Shieber, 1994; Shieber and Schabes, 1990) extends TAG by taking the elementary structures to be pairs of TAG trees with links between particular nodes in those trees. Derivation proceeds as in TAG except that all operations must be paired. That is, a tree can only be substituted or adjoined at a node if its pair is simultaneously substituted or adjoined at a linked node. We notate the links by using boxed indices i marking linked nodes.

The resulting semantic representation can be read off the right-hand derived tree by treating the leftmost child of a node as a functor and its siblings as its arguments. Our sample sentence thus results in the semantic representation apparently(likes( john,mary)). 3 Quantifier Scope We start by reviewing the prior approach to quantifier semantics in synchronous TAG. Consider the sentence “Everyone likes someone.” We would like to allow both the reading where some takes scope over every and the reading where every takes scope over some.
