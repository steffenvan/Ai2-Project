<bodyText confidence="0.999434">
We review psycholinguistic research on the
use of intonation in dialogue, focusing on our
own recent work. In experiments using com-
plex real-world tasks and naïve speakers and
listeners, we show that speakers reliably spe-
cific prosodic cues to signal their intensions,
and that listeners use these cues to recognize
syntactic and pragmatic aspects of discourse
meaning.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979210526316">
The intonation of an utterance conveys a great deal
of information about a speaker’s intended message.
Recent research has addressed whether, when, and
how speakers use intonation to transmit linguistic
and paralinguistic meaning. Speakers use intona-
tion for a broad range of functions in communica-
tion, such as: to mark the difference between
immediately relevant vs. background information;
to express contrast, contradiction, and correction;
and to indicate the intended syntax of ambiguous
utterances.
In this paper, we will review recent experimental
studies of naïve speakers’ and listeners’ use of in-
tonation during production and comprehension.
We focus primarily on our own work, where we
have used naturalistic, relatively complex real-
world tasks to elicit speakers’ intonation in dia-
logue, and to examine listeners’ ability to use into-
nation during comprehension.

1.1 Structure of the Review
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992051967741935">
The review includes a very brief overview of the
ToBI (Tone and Break Indices: Beckman, Hir-
shberg &amp; Shattuck Hufnagel, 2005; Brugos, Shat-
tuck Hufnagel, &amp; Veilleux, 2006), a system widely
used to annotate the locations and types of intona-
tional entities present in speech. We then turn to
the correspondence between intonational phrasing
and syntactic constituency, examining whether and
how speakers use the location and size of prosodic
breaks as they produce syntactic structure, and test-
ing listeners’ ability to use this correspondence.
Next, we will discuss the role of intonational
prominence in discourse structuring. In particular,
we will examine the production and comprehen-
sion of accentual prominence to express referential
contrast. Our experimental findings suggest that
both phrasing and prominence cues are robust for
understanding spoken messages, and infelicitous
use of those prosodic cues may mislead the lis-
tener’s comprehension processes. The closing dis-
cussion emphasizes the contribution of intonation
to spoken language processing, and its essential
role in discourse modeling.
2 Prosodic phrasing and syntactic structure
Production experiments investigating the corre-
spondence of prosodic and syntactic phrasing in
language production were conducted using a par-
tially-scripted two-player board game task (Speer,
Warren, &amp; Schafer, 2003, Schafer, Speer, &amp; War-
ren, 2005). The game was constructed to elicit par-
ticular syntactic contrasts as the players spoke to

each other to exchange information and move
game pieces from start to goal, avoiding hazards
and collecting bonuses. Speakers were required to
use a fixed set of sentence frames and game piece
names to construct instructions, requests and ac-
knowledgements. Board layouts were carefully
constructed to create situational contexts for the
resulting dialogues produced by the speakers, so
that potentially syntactically ambiguous utterances
sometimes remained ambiguous given the game
context, but sometimes were contextually disam-
biguated. The task allowed recording of multiple
renditions of a sentence from the same speaker, as
well as across speakers.
Phonetic analyses and phonological transcription
of speech from the game task experiments demon-
strates that speakers reliably used prosodic cues to
signal syntactic structure, and to convey the in-
tended meaning of syntactically ambiguous sen-
tences. Although speakers produced a wide variety
of prosodic patterns for the same sentence, they
consistently placed the strongest prosodic break in
the syntactic location that indicated their intended
meaning. This effect held for different syntactic
types, and was robust across various types of po-
tentially disambiguating situational contexts.
Companion comprehension experiments used the
naïve speakers’ productions from the game task as
stimuli in forced-choice experiments. Results show
that listeners make reliable use of prosodic regu-
larities to accurately recover the speakers’ intended
meanings.

3 Intonational prominence and contrast
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989745454546">
To investigate naïve speakers’ use of intonational
prominence to mark contrast, Ito, Speer &amp; Beck-
man (2004; Ito &amp; Speer, 2006) elicited unscripted
speech using a holiday tree decoration task. Naïve
speakers were asked to be ‘directors,’ giving in-
structions about how to hang ornaments on a tree
to a confederate ‘decorator.’ Photos of ornaments
and the tree were used to give ‘directors’ the se-
quence of ornaments and their intended locations
on the tree. By using a set of common color terms
and object names for the ornaments, we collected
multiple spontaneous productions of target adjec-
tive-noun pairs (e.g. “green bell”) in a natural con-
versational setting. The sequence of decoration
was constructed to create contrastive discourse
contexts (green bell -&gt; blue bell). Prosodic annota-
tion of the spontaneous speech and supporting
phonetic measurements indicated that speakers
used prominent pitch accent more frequently when
the decoration sequence was contrastive than when
it was not (e.g. “green bell.... 4 Now, find a
BLUE bell”: where the adjective ‘blue’ is accented
and the repeated noun ‘bell’ is deaccented).
To test how prominent accent guides referential
resolution during comprehension, a set of experi-
ments was conducted using eye movement moni-
toring technique (Ito &amp; Speer, 2008). Spoken
stimuli modeled on the productions from the pre-
vious production study were recorded by a trained
phonetician. This time, naïve listeners followed
instructions to locate ornaments and hang them as
specified on a small tree.
Results showed the immediate use of intona-
tional cues by the listeners. For example, when a
prominent accent felicitously marked contrast on a
color adjective (“First hang the red ball. 4 Next,
hang the BLUE ball”), fixation proportions to tar-
get cells increased more quickly than when intona-
tion did not cue the contrast (“Hang the red ball. 4
Next, hang the blue ball.”). The timing of fixations
indicates that listeners moved their eyes to the cor-
rect ornament before processing the segmental in-
formation of the noun. In addition, prominent
accent misled listeners when the decoration se-
quence did not prompt contrast (blue ball 4
GREEN drum: here, participants looked at balls
before they redirected fixations to the drum). These
incorrect fixations increased toward the end of the
adjective and continued to rise halfway into the
noun with conflicting segmental information.
Thus, listeners were executing their initial visual
search based on the intonational information of the
adjective, demonstrating the use of prosody for
making predictions during comprehension of run-
ning speech.
