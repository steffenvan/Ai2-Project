framework should be reusable to different scope of
background knowledge. Such a modern digital
museum associating text processing mechanism is
believed to be a sound approach of E-Learning on
Language and Literature.
This article discussed this approach on the
Digital Museum framework design, how it is
associated with Computational Linguistics, and
how to integrate knowledge to maximize the E-
Learning efficiency. These discussions will be
based on an example of the Digital Museum of
Chinese Ancient Poetry Art, by Peking University
2003. [10] The following section will discuss the
general framework design of digital museum. We
will discuss text processing work behind the
Digital Museum in Section 3, and Knowledge

<bodyText confidence="0.999465181818182">
Instead of digital library and traditional digital
museum systems, which provide single function of
exhibition, a modern digital museum provides
multidimensional functions. Generally, a modern
digital museum has three key functions, exhibition,
education and research. In our design of Digital
Museum for Language and Literature, the three
dimansion would be: interacting theme based
exhibitions from texts, E-Learning modules on
language and literature, and related research on
Computational Linguistics.

2.1 Digital Museum and E-Learning on
Language and Literature
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957166666667">
Digital Museum systems have gone beyond
exhibitions of digital collections. Instead, they
would increasingly emphasize educational uses
rather than traditional exhibitions. It provides users
with educational and well-motivated exhibitions
[13]. UK-wide Digital Museum linked exhibitions
connected by subject and theme with an integrated
learning environment [6]. By 2000, the National
Science Plan of Digital Museums of Taiwan has
defined a specific and integrated program on how
to utilize scientific technology, especially
information technology, and how to digitalize the
archives in both cultural and natural fields, with
significant humanistic meaning. It has conducted
further discussions on how to apply these kinds of
digital projects and productions to education,
research and industrialization, for the sake of
conserving culture, promoting education, inspiring
research and increment of industrialization. [3].
Knowledge on a learning topic should be
organized as an exhibition theme, which is
represented by a series of real or virtual objects
and detailed descriptions. Exhibitions of various
themes are linked together corresponding to the
relativity of their themes. Learners can participate
in the Digital Museum by choosing a pathway of
linked exhibitions with a typical topic. Special
modules will also be provided for participants to
interacting with the system, which will be
discussed in section 4.

The life cycle of a modern digital museum looks
like a fountain model [11]. There are feedbacks
from each design phase to previous phases. There
are several milestones in the life cycle, each of
which acts as a knowledge container and a

levels. [14]. These knowledge containers are as
follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.9992921">
The Digital Museum of Chinese Ancient Poetry
Art [10] is a research model by Peking University,
Beijing, combining E-Learning, computer assisted
research on Chinese Ancient Poetry and
computational linguistics. A prototype of this
Digital Museum was designed in order to meet the
needs of exhibition, education and research on the
art of Chinese Ancient Poetry. The analysis, design
and implementation of this project were on a
highly abstract level.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.682142">
2.3.1 Corpus, Design and Prototype System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922285714286">
The information origin pool and the refined
knowledge base of this project were also the
corpus for related computational linguistics
research. It involves Chinese Ancient Poetry across
2,000 years, approximately 100,000 items [10].
Other advanced knowledge bases such as Author
Information base, Image and media base, Location
information base and Word lists were constructed.
In the design of this Digital Museum system,
knowledge mining was divided into two types,
item entity information mining and relational
information mining. Item entity information was
detailed to exhibiting items, characters, images,
media, locations and words. Relational information
reflected all aspects of relations among items.
Metadata for each category of instances was
defined in the design phase. Particularly, a group
of items with relating meaning was structured as a
virtual item class, which was also treated as a
specific item.
In the prototype system, items of poetry,
character, location and others were exhibited along
with all related formats of knowledge. Users can
leap from one item to its related items, and learn
them in the context where they originally belongs.
Sample exhibitions on specific themes, such as
clothing, plants, food and spring were also
designed.

2.3.2 E-Learning and Related research from
this Digital Museum
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901807692307">
In the dimension of learning, Digital Museum of
Chinese Ancient Poetry explored the study of E-
Leaning system for the language and literature
features of Chinese Ancient Poetry. It enabled a
way to learn a poem in its background environment,
with reference to its related poetry and other
related objects in multiple formats. The system
also presented statistical research results of the
corpus to users, such as the words usages of
authors, the cooccurrence of words, the likelihood
of the hidden meanings of words, which help users
to be well-informed and easier to understand in
learning a poem or a word.
In the dimension of research, the digital museum
is closely related to specific research topics on
computational linguistics, especially statistical
natural language processing. We refined unknown
words from the corpus though statistic methods
and explored to cluster them into concepts. In this
way, we studied the hidden meanings of words and
poetry in context and studied the relation discovery
among poems. We also conducted some research
of knowledge mining and discovering from corpus,
which can also inspire extended researches like
Computer Assisted archaeology on Chinese
Ancient Poetry.

Museum Framework
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999886037037037">
Knowledge of humanities areas, especially
language and literature, is commonly carried by
texts. Therefore, the language processing,
specifically the text processing will be vital for
transforming pure texts and domain knowledge
into abstracted exhibitions. Actually, most digital
museums today haven&apos;t made good use of
computational linguistics techniques. Most of them
remain on organizing exhibitions manually and
providing them online. Those exhibitions are
relatively isolated from each other.
However, there are remarkable relations among
text units and real objects and topics, which are
hidden in the texts. For example, the word
“willow” seems having nothing to do with “getting
apart” by the semantic definitions, but in the
context, “breaking a willow branch” does indicate
“send-off friends”, or “seeing a friend leaving” in
Chinese Ancient Poetry.
These meaningful entities and relations can be
learned from the statistical analysis of large scale
poetry texts. The use of computational linguistics
methods here is crucial, which distinguishes it with
traditional Digital Museum models. Statistical
natural language processing over large scale corpus
is the most significant approach we have adopted
in this research.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9979575">
3.1 Construction of Corpuses and Integrated
Knowledge bases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996971875">
The first phase of language processing is to build
corpora and knowledge bases. Primitive corpora
are constructed by archive digitalization. Refined
corpora are constructed by applying language
processors on the primitive corpus. We can use
Digital Museum of Chinese Ancient Poetry for
example.
For the Digital Museum of Chinese Ancient
Poetry Art, the primitive corpora include texts of
poems over 1, 200, 000 lines, descriptions of 4000
authors, a name dictionary and a location
dictionary. The refined corpora include a words
dictionary which is thoroughly discovered from the
texts, a concept base constructed by supervised
word clustering and a storage of words
cooccurances. Other knowledge bases include
images, music, medias(reading), relics, events, and
a series of expertise knowledge on Chinese
Ancoent Poetry.
The general ontology of domain knowledge was
carefully studied. Important entities and relations
from texts and related domains were determined.
Consequently, we carefully designed the metadata
and chose a database system to maintain the
knowledge base. This knowledge base should be
expandable so that it can contain texts, entities
from related domains, and relations.
The last step of this phase is to design an
referencing mechanism to query and get the
answer. The outcome of this phase is an integrated
knowledge base, the textual part of which is the
corpus for mining and knowledge discovery.

3.2 Text Mining: Extracting Objects from
Texts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996875">
As soon as the corpora and knowledge bases are
constructed, higher level methods of natural
language processing are applied to mine in the
corpus. The goal is to find objects abstracted from
texts, which are organized by individual topics.
Statistical natural language processing plays a very
important role in this procedure, which can be
described in the following three levels.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.728135" genericHeader="method">
3.2.1 Extracting Direct Relevant Objects from
Texts.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999901956521739">
Textual knowledge is not “dead” in the fields of
language and literature. It is interacting with
knowledge in other forms, by other carrier or on
other abstract level. Taking Chinese ancient poetry
for example, a poem is associated to its author, its
era and its writing background. The textual body of
a poem also refers to certain persons, events,
locations, plants, scenes, feelings and other entities,
either real or virtual. In addition, there are various
sources of objects relevant to the poem, such as
paintings, calligraphy works, music and cultural
relics, etc. All these entities above are so important
to the synopsis of the poem that it is an advisable
way to learn the poem with the appearance of these
objects. Furthermore, relying on these directly
relevant objects makes teaching and learning much
more open and exciting than barely focusing on
texts.
In the early phase of Digital Museum design, an
integrated exhibition base is built, in which directly
relevant entities of the texts are refined, stored in
relational or XML databases and associated with
the body of texts.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.5792">
3.2.2 Discovering Hidden Entities and Relations
Associated with Language Units.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994478125">
As the Computer assisted research develops on
these fields, we can work on the hidden knowledge
of texts by means of text mining and retrieval. As
language technology evolves, a computational age
of language has arrived [1]. We can conduct
computer assisted analytical research on language,
with both linguistic and statistical approaches. In
the research on the language of Chinese ancient
poetry, we studied the statistical concurrences and
meaningful units in the texts, extracted words from
collocations and clustered words into meaningful
concepts. In further research, we explored ways to
study the hidden meanings of the words and
collocations, especially those related to emotions
of human. Consequently, expected to learn
emotional characteristic of a poem, associating
words, concepts and other units it refers with the
similar characteristic.
On the other hand, language and texts are the
most important carriers of cultural fragments.
Many interesting knowledge patterns are hidden in
the texts. There is a considerable proportion of
Chinese ancient history and culture buried in the
texts of Chinese ancient poetry, which evolutes
along more than 2,000 years and involves locations
all over China. By language techniques, fragments
of culture can be mined from the texts, refined and
stored, and finally integrated into interacting
virtual scenes.
By this we can discover hidden entities and
relations associated with text and expand it to
analytical meaningful segments.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.701376">
3.2.3 Expanding Indirect Relations.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975739130435">
In our framework, knowledge entities are not
living alone but interacting. Both textual entities
and other objects are associated to its relevant
entity set. There are two kinds of relations
identifying that two entities are interacting, direct
relation, which have already been discussed above,
and indirect relation. For instance, a poem refers
to various knowledge objects, thus poems referring
to the same objects are indirectly interacting with
each other. These poems are involved in their
relevant entity set, with “identical reference” as an
indirect relation. In a more intelligent level, poems
with the similar hidden meanings or relevant
emotions are arranged together as a set. This set
can be associated with a topic, a subject, a scene or
a specific semantic cluster.
In these three approaches to expand textual
knowledge into relevant objects, a former purely
textual entity has been developed as involving in
the surrounding of various relevant objects, real or
virtual. Thus we complete the procedure of
extracting objects for exhibitions from texts. An
example from poems to objects is as follows:

3.3 Theme Driven Knowledge Discovery
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945666666667">
From the statistical analysis on character
concurrences, we applied various methods to
discover unknown words from the texts. Chinese
language is different from other language because
there isn’t natural interval from a word to another.
We consider all words to be unknown in the
beginning and generate a word dictionary from the
filtering by mutual information value, μ-test and
other statistical methods.
Upon the word dictionary, we conducted words
clustering by the distance of words concurrence
vectors. This procedure has abstracted concepts
from words. After supervised filtering, these
concepts will indicate some hidden semantic
meanings.
The consecutive knowledge discovery work will
be theme driven. First, a theme, or a learning topic
is decided, some features and key concepts of this
theme will be decided with the expert knowledge.
Using statistical methods, we can find the concepts
and words which are semantically similar or in
some way related to this theme. Then, directly and
indirectly related objects (discussed in section 3.2)
will be associated with the topic. Then, reluctant
units are eliminated. We will filter the most
significant entities and relations, which can be
represented by combinations of both concepts and
words, and organize them around the theme. In this
way, we can put the topic/theme back to its ancient
living environment.
Further works includes rebuilding ancient
scenarios where the topic belongs, and mining for
relations among topics.

4 Knowledge Processing and Integration of
the Digital Museum
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.961904181818182">
Knowledge processing plays a very significant
role in the Digital Museum framework. It is
involved as a clue throughout the life cycle of the
digital museum. The entire design and
implementing of the digital museum is focusing on
language processing, knowledge discovery and
exhibition integrating. The knowledge processing
procedures can be represented in the following
figure:

museum.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990988">
4.1 Knowledge Processing Hierarchy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998597">
An intelligent platform of knowledge deals with
knowledge in five primary hierarchies, namely,
knowledge citation, knowledge application,
knowledge transmitting, knowledge learning and
knowledge developing [8]. This division of
knowledge hierarchies remarkably adapts the
needs of an E-Learning program. In the study of
this article, we make a little modification to this
division and applied it to the Digital Museum
system as follows:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.991941222222222">
Knowledge Citation
Knowledge Applying
Knowledge Learning
Learning and Teaching
Knowledge Mining
Knowledge Representing

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999869833333334">
Actually, this division is somewhat relative and
not absolute. For instance, in some activities
defined as knowledge representation and
knowledge developing, we may also need to do
knowledge citation and applying. However, this
division of knowledge hierarchy would help to
define the functions of Knowledge Platform and
content the needs for knowledge by systems and
users. [8]
The Digital Museum presents multidimensions
according to the three functions of exhibition,
education and research. The processing targets,
procedures and emphases on Knowledge vary
among dimensions.
In the dimension of exhibition, system focuses
on Knowledge citation and Knowledge
representing in the hierarchy above.
In the dimension of e-learning, system focuses
on the hierarchy of Knowledge applying, learning
and teaching, Knowledge Representing and
information interaction.
In the dimension of computational linguistics
research, system emphasizes the hierarchy of
Knowledge Mining and Knowledge developing.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9896135">
4.2 Two Types of Integration for Knowledge
Objects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996637970588236">
After discussing the generating of objects from
the texts, we would be interested in how to
integrate them for E-Learning.
Relating and interacting objects are extracted
from texts and stored in the exhibition base. The
next phase is to arrange exhibitions by selecting,
dividing and integrating these objects, and
construct the digital museum interface.
There are two key forms of objects integration,
tutored and theme-oriented exhibitions and virtual
scenarios.
In the first form, tutored theme-oriented
exhibition, objects relevant to a specific subject or
theme are integrated and represented in multi-
modals. This interface design provides a dynamic
exhibition module by grouping texts and their
relevant objects in various formats together,
providing docent knowledge for this topic and
links to relevant topic exhibitions. Learners
participate in one exhibition and go through links
fitting to their needs or under instructions, thus
personalized learning paths are formed.
There are two tips in tutored theme-oriented
exhibitions. One is “multi-modal”. Personalized
exhibitions in our framework enable learning
through multi channels, in forms of texts, image,
music and virtual reality, etc. Also taking Chinese
ancient poetry for example, we first discover the
relevant scenes and hidden emotions of a poem,
select objects referring to similar scenes and
emotions, provide them as background materials
and then integrate them with the poem. A more
detailed instance is the Auto-matching poems and
paintings. The other is “interactive”. In our
framework, a learner can add his remarks or
discuss in every exhibition topic. These remarks
are processed and stored as new relevant objects to
this topic. Users can also provide materials or
background information to an object or a topic, and
can provide their own exhibition plans of new
organizations of objects. The system studies the
feedbacks and provides users with personalized
participation paths.
The second integration form is scenarios.
Knowledge objects were recorded in texts from
their original living environments. By collecting
and extracting relevant objects from texts and
analytical researching on their relevant
environmental elements such as emotions, we are
able to put a textual object back to a scene
representing its original living environment by
rebuilding these origin scenes. Teaching and
learning are made easier and more exciting with
participating in the original scenes that a topic
really lived. With the technology of multimedia
and virtual reality, we are able to integrate objects
and environmental elements surrounding a specific
topic and rebuild a virtual scene, which is
represented in our framework as multimedia
demonstration, tests and games.
These two key integrating patterns organize
various formats of objects and represent these
integrated exhibitions to users in an interactive and
personalized way. It maximizes the educational use
of a digital museum on language and literature
fields.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958137931034">
Computer-based education on language and
literature has both its advantage and difficulty. On
one hand it provides learners with abundant
relating materials, on the other hand it’s tedious
and difficult for learners to acquire knowledge in
the sea of information. The approach of extracting
objects from texts, and integrating them to build an
interactive and vivid exhibitions enables learners
both to explore in broad scope of knowledge and to
enjoy exciting and comprehensible learning.
Computer techniques are adopted in the framework
of Digital Museums to maximize its educational
use. How to make use of the methods from
computational linguistics, especially statistical
methods is the bottleneck or the key to success of
this e-learning approach. On the other hand, the
needs of e-learning and the abstracting of digital
exhibitions from texts have very positive effect on
pushing the research of computational linguistics.
Significant techniques include unknown word
discovery, clustering and other issues in text
mining. Besides the conituous work on text mining,
future research will focus on how to personalize
the learning paths of learners, and enable in-time
processing of user feedbacks. Investigations and
evaluations will be made both on the e-learning
system and the efficiency of text mining
techniques over typical kinds of texts, like Chinese
ancient poetry.

Such a modern digital museum associating text processing mechanism is believed to be a sound approach of E-Learning on Language and Literature. This article discussed this approach on the Digital Museum framework design, how it is associated with Computational Linguistics, and how to integrate knowledge to maximize the E- Learning efficiency. These discussions will be based on an example of the Digital Museum of Chinese Ancient Poetry Art, by Peking University 2003. [10] The following section will discuss the general framework design of digital museum. We will discuss text processing work behind the Digital Museum in Section 3, and Knowledge Processing and integration in Section 4. Some more discussion and future work will be provided at the conclusion section. 2 The Digital Museum Framework Instead of digital library and traditional digital museum systems, which provide single function of exhibition, a modern digital museum provides multidimensional functions. Generally, a modern digital museum has three key functions, exhibition, education and research. In our design of Digital Museum for Language and Literature, the three dimansion would be: interacting theme based exhibitions from texts, E-Learning modules on language and literature, and related research on Computational Linguistics. 2.1 Digital Museum and E-Learning on Language and Literature Digital Museum systems have gone beyond exhibitions of digital collections. Instead, they would increasingly emphasize educational uses rather than traditional exhibitions. It provides users with educational and well-motivated exhibitions [13]. UK-wide Digital Museum linked exhibitions connected by subject and theme with an integrated learning environment [6]. By 2000, the National Science Plan of Digital Museums of Taiwan has defined a specific and integrated program on how to utilize scientific technology, especially information technology, and how to digitalize the archives in both cultural and natural fields, with significant humanistic meaning. It has conducted further discussions on how to apply these kinds of digital projects and productions to education, research and industrialization, for the sake of conserving culture, promoting education, inspiring research and increment of industrialization. [3]. Knowledge on a learning topic should be organized as an exhibition theme, which is represented by a series of real or virtual objects and detailed descriptions. Exhibitions of various themes are linked together corresponding to the relativity of their themes. Learners can participate in the Digital Museum by choosing a pathway of linked exhibitions with a typical topic. Special modules will also be provided for participants to interacting with the system, which will be discussed in section 4. 2.2 General Architecture Design of a Digital Museum The life cycle of a modern digital museum looks like a fountain model [11]. There are feedbacks from each design phase to previous phases. There are several milestones in the life cycle, each of which acts as a knowledge container and a foundation of knowledge processing on upper levels. [14]. These knowledge containers are as follows: Milestones Functionality Information Origin Pool: (Primitive Corpus) The mass storage of large-scale information from digitalization work. Refined Knowledge Bases (Refined Corpus) Database storage of useful and relevant knowledge knowledge refining. Metadata for Exhibitions Metadata describing ontology, with all detailed metadata for knowledge flows, items relations Integrated Exhibition Base Database for Exhibiting items, individual or integrated, for regular accessing by system. Reusable Tool Base for Tool pool for reusable module functions, individual or integrated components for various use. Functional Modules Multi-functional Interface Web-based interface for exhibitions, education and research.

In the early phase of Digital Museum design, an integrated exhibition base is built, in which directly relevant entities of the texts are refined, stored in relational or XML databases and associated with the body of texts. 3.2.2 Discovering Hidden Entities and Relations Associated with Language Units. As the Computer assisted research develops on these fields, we can work on the hidden knowledge of texts by means of text mining and retrieval. As language technology evolves, a computational age of language has arrived [1]. We can conduct computer assisted analytical research on language, with both linguistic and statistical approaches. In the research on the language of Chinese ancient poetry, we studied the statistical concurrences and meaningful units in the texts, extracted words from collocations and clustered words into meaningful concepts. In further research, we explored ways to study the hidden meanings of the words and collocations, especially those related to emotions of human. Consequently, expected to learn emotional characteristic of a poem, associating words, concepts and other units it refers wi</context>

The entire design and implementing of the digital museum is focusing on language processing, knowledge discovery and exhibition integrating. The knowledge processing procedures can be represented in the following figure: Figure3: Knowledge Processing in this digital museum. 4.1 Knowledge Processing Hierarchy An intelligent platform of knowledge deals with knowledge in five primary hierarchies, namely, knowledge citation, knowledge application, knowledge transmitting, knowledge learning and knowledge developing [8]. This division of knowledge hierarchies remarkably adapts the needs of an E-Learning program. In the study of this article, we make a little modification to this division and applied it to the Digital Museum system as follows: Knowledge Citation Knowledge Applying Knowledge Learning Learning and Teaching Knowledge Mining Knowledge Representing Knowledge Representing to Users Information Interacting Knowledge Developing Table 1: A knowledge processing hierachy in the Digital Museum Words Concepts Persons Location Scenes Cultural Poem Relics Fragments Events Emotions Actually, this division is </context>
