In this paper, we use Arabic natural lan-
guage processing techniques to analyze
Arabic debates. The goal is to identify
how the participants in a discussion split
into subgroups with contrasting opinions.
The members of each subgroup share the
same opinion with respect to the discus-
sion topic and an opposing opinion to
the members of other subgroups. We
use opinion mining techniques to identify
opinion expressions and determine their
polarities and their targets. We opinion
predictions to represent the discussion in
one of two formal representations: signed
attitude network or a space of attitude vec-
tors. We identify opinion subgroups by
partitioning the signed network represen-
tation or by clustering the vector space
representation. We evaluate the system us-
ing a data set of labeled discussions and
show that it achieves good results.

Arabic is one of the fastest growing languages
on the internet. The number of internet users in
the Arab region grew by 2500% over the past 10
years. As of January 2012, the number of Arabic-
speaking internet users was 86 millions. The re-
cent political and civic movements in the Arab
World resulted in a revolutionary growth in the
number of Arabic users on social networking sites.

This growth in the presence of Arab users on
social networks and all the interactions and dis-
cussions that happen among them led to a huge
amount of opinion-rich Arabic text being avail-
able. Analyzing this text could reveal the different
viewpoints of Arab users with respect to the topics
that they discuss online.
When a controversial topic is discussed, it is
normal for the discussants to adopt different view-
points towards it. This usually causes rifts in dis-
cussion groups and leads to the split of the dis-
cussants into subgroups with contrasting opinions.
Our goal in this paper is to use natural language
processing techniques to detect opinion subgroups
in Arabic discussions. Our approach starts by
identifying opinionated (subjective) text and deter-
mining its polarity (positive, negative, or neutral).
Next, we determine the target of each opinion ex-
pression. The target of opinion can be a named
entity mentioned in the discussion or an aspect of
the discussed topic. We use the identified opinion-
target relations to represent the discussion in one
of two formal representations. In the first repre-
sentation, each discussant is represented by a vec-
tor that encodes all his or her opinion information
towards the discussion topic. In the second repre-
sentation, each discussant is represented by a node
in a signed graph. A positive edge connects two
discussants if they have similar opinion towards
the topic, otherwise the sign of the edge is nega-

vector space (the first representation) or partition
the signed network (the second representation).
We evaluate this system using a data set of Ara-
bic discussions collected from an Arabic debating
site. We experiment with several variations of the
system. The results show that the clustering the

than partitioning the signed network representa-

2 Previous Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973690476191">
Our work is related to a large body of research on
opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Pang &amp;
Lee (2008) and Liu &amp; Zhang (2012) wrote two re-
cent comprehensive surveys about sentiment anal-
ysis and opinion mining techniques and applica-
tions.
Previous work has proposed methods for iden-
tifying subjective text that expresses opinion
and distinguishing it from objective text that
presents factual information (Wiebe, 2000; Hatzi-
vassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000a; Banea et al., 2008;
Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).
Subjective text may express positive, negative,
or neutral opinion. Previous work addressed the
problem of identifying the polarity of subjective
text (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000b; Hassan
et al., 2010; Riloff et al., 2006). Many of the pro-
posed methods for text polarity identification de-
pend on the availability of polarity lexicons (i.e.
lists of positive and negative words). Several ap-
proaches have been devised for building such lex-
icons (Turney and Littman, 2003; Kanayama and
Nasukawa, 2006; Takamura et al., 2005; Hassan
and Radev, 2010). Other research efforts focused
on identifying the holders and the targets of opin-
ion (Zhai et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni, 2007;
Bethard et al., 2004).
Opinion mining and sentiment analysis tech-
niques have been used in various applications.
One example of such applications is identifying
perspectives (Grefenstette et al., 2004; Lin et al.,
2006) which is most similar to the topic of this
paper. For example, in (Lin et al., 2006), the au-
thors experiment with several supervised and sta-
tistical models to capture how perspectives are ex-
pressed at the document and the sentence levels.
Laver et al. (2003) proposed a method for extract-
ing perspectives from political texts. They used
their method to estimate the policy positions of po-
litical parties in Britain and Ireland, on both eco-
nomic and social policy dimensions.
Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) present an un-
supervised opinion analysis method for debate-
side classification. They mine the web to learn
associations that are indicative of opinion stances
in debates and combine this knowledge with dis-
course information. Anand et al. (2011) present a
supervised method for stance classification. They
use a number of linguistic and structural fea-
tures such as unigrams, bigrams, cue words, re-
peated punctuation, and opinion dependencies to
build a stance classification model. In previous
work, we proposed a method that uses participant-
to-participant and participant-to-topic attitudes to
identify subgroups in ideological discussions us-
ing attitude vector space clustering (Abu-Jbara and
Radev, 2012). In this paper, we extend this method
by adding latent similarity features to the attitude
vectors and applying it to Arabic discussions. In
another previous work, our group proposed a su-
pervised method for extracting signed social net-
works from text (Hassan et al., 2012a). The
signed networks constructed using this method
were based only on participant-to-participant at-
titudes that are expressed explicitly in discussions.
We used this method to extract signed networks
from discussions and used a partitioning algo-
rithm to detect opinion subgroups (Hassan et al.,
2012b). In this paper, we extend this method by
using participant-to-topic attitudes to construct the
signed network.
Unfortunately, not much work has been done
on Arabic sentiment analysis and opinion min-
ing. Abbasi et al. (2008) applies sentiment anal-
ysis techniques to identify and classify document-
level opinions in text crawled from English and
Arabic web forums. Hassan et al. (2011) pro-
posed a method for identifying the polarity of non-
English words using multilingual semantic graphs.
They applied their method to Arabic and Hindi.
Abdul-Mageed and Diab (2011) annotated a cor-
pus of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) news text
for subjectivity at the sentence level. In a later
work (2012a), they expanded their corpus by la-

beling data from more genres using Amazon Me-

veloped SAMAR, a system for subjectivity and
Sentiment Analysis for Arabic social media gen-
res. We use this system as a component in our
approach.

3 Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970111111111">
In this section, we present our approach to de-
tecting opinion subgroups in Arabic discussions.
We propose a pipeline that consists of five com-
ponents. The input to the pipeline is a discussion
thread in Arabic language crawled from a discus-
sion forum. The output is the list of participants
in the discussion and the subgroup membership of
each discussant. We describe the components of
the pipeline in the following subsections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997896">
3.1 Preprocessing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967555555556">
The input to this component is a discussion thread
in HTML format. We parse the HTML file to iden-
tify the posts, the discussants, and the thread struc-
ture. We transform the Arabic content of the posts
and the discussant names that are written in Arabic
to the Buckwalter encoding (Buckwalter, 2004).
We use AMIRAN (Diab, 2009), a system for pro-
cessing Arabic text, to tokenize the text and iden-
tify noun phrases.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999293">
3.2 Identifying Opinionated Text
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992454545455">
To identify opinion-bearing text, we start from the
word level. We identify the polarized words that
appear in text by looking each word up in a lexicon
of Arabic polarized words. In our experiments, we
use Sifat (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012b), a lex-
icon of 3982 Arabic adjectives labeled as positive,
negative, or neutral.
The polarity of a word may be dependant on
its context (Wilson et al., 2005). For example,
a positive word that appears in a negated context
should be treated as expressing negative opinion
rather than positive. To identify the polarity of
a word given the sentence it appears in, we use
SAMAR (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2012b), a system
for Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis for Ara-
bic social media genres. SAMAR labels a sen-
tence that contains an opinion expression as pos-
itive, negative, or neutral taking into account the
context of the opinion expression. The reported
accuracy of SAMAR on different data sets ranges
between 84% and 95% for subjectivity classifica-
tion and 65% and 81% for polarity classification.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998767">
3.3 Identifying Opinion Targets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999780625">
In this step, we determine the targets that the opin-
ion is expressed towards. We treat as an opin-
ion target any noun phrase (NP) that appears in
a sentence that SAMAR labeled as polarized (pos-
itive or negative) in the previous step. To avoid
the noise that may result from including all noun
phrases, we limit what we consider as an opinion
target, to the ones that appear in at least two posts
written by two different participants. Since, the
sentence may contain multiple possible targets for
every opinion expression, we associate each opin-
ion expression with the target that is closest to it in
the sentence. For each discussant, we keep track
of the targets mentioned in his/her posts and the
number of times each target was mentioned in a
positive/negative context.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993058">
3.4 Latent Textual Similarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988923076923">
If two participants share the same opinion, they
tend to focus on similar aspects of the discus-
sion topic and emphasize similar points that sup-
port their opinion. To capture this, we follow
previous work (Guo and Diab, 2012; Dasigi et
al., 2012) and apply Latent Dirichelet Allocation
(LDA) topic models to the text written by the dif-
ferent participants. We use an LDA model with
100 topics. So, we represent all the text written
in the discussion by each participant as a vector
of 100 dimensions. The vector of each participant
contains the topic distribution of the participant, as
produced by the LDA model.

<bodyText confidence="0.999989181818182">
At this point, we have for every discussant the tar-
gets towards which he/she expressed explicit opin-
ion and a 100-dimensions vector representing the
LDA distribution of the text written by him/her.
We use this information to represent the discussion
in two representations. In the first representation,
each discussant is represented by a vector. For ev-
ery target identified in steps 3 of the pipeline, we
add three entries in the vector. The first entry holds
the total number of times the target was mentioned
by the discussant. The second entry holds the

number of times the target was mentioned in a pos-
itive context. The third entry holds the number of
target mentions in a negative context. We also add
to this vector the 100 topic entries from the LDA
vector of that discussant. So, if the number of tar-
gets identified in step 3 of the pipeline is t then
the number of entries in the discussant vector is
3 * t + 100.
To identify opinion subgroups, we cluster
the vector space. We experiment with several
clustering algorithms including K-means (Mac-
Queen, 1967), Farthest First (FF) (Hochbaum and
Shmoys, 1985; Dasgupta, 2002), and Expectation
Maximization (EM) (Dempster et al., 1977).
The second representation is a signed network
representation. In this representation, each dis-
cussant is represented by a node in a graph. Two
discussants are connected by an edge if they both
mention at least one common target in their posts.
If a discussant mentions a target multiple times in
different contexts with different polarities, the ma-
jority polarity is assumed as the opinion of this
discussant with respect to this target. A positive
sign is assigned to the edge connecting two discus-
sants if the number of targets that they have simi-
lar opinion towards is greater than the targets that
they have opposing opinion towards, otherwise a
negative sign is assigned to the edge.
To identify subgroups, we use a signed net-
work partitioning algorithm to partition the net-
work. Each resulting partition constitutes a sub-
group. Following (Hassan et al., 2012b), we use
the Dorian-Mrvar (1996) algorithm to partition the
signed network. The optimization criterion aims
to have dense positive links within groups and
dense negative links between groups.
The optimization function is as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.997439">
F(C) = α x |NEG |+ (1 − α) x |POS |(1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999396875">
where C is the clustering under evaluation,
|NEG |is the number of negative links between
nodes in the same subgroup, |POS |is the number
of positive links between nodes in different sub-
groups, and α is a parameter that specifies impor-
tance of the two terms. We set α to 0.5 in all our
experiments.
Clusters are selected such that P(C) is mini-
mum. The best clustering that minimizes P(C) is
found by moving nodes around clusters in a greedy
way starting with a random clustering. To han-
dle the possibility of finding a local minima, the
whole process is repeated k times with random
restarts and the clustering with the minimum value
of P(C) is returned. We set k to 3 in all our ex-
periments.

<bodyText confidence="0.999881333333333">
We use data from an Arabic discussion forum
called Naqeshny.2. Naqeshny is a platform for
two-sided debates. The debate starts when a per-
son asks a question (e.g. which political party do
you support?) and gives two possible answers or
positions. The registered members of the web-
site who are interested in the topic participate in
the debate by selecting a position and then post-
ing text to support that position and dispute the

opposing position. This means that the data set is
self-labeled for subgroup membership. Since the
tools used in our system are trained on Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA) text, we selected debates
that are mostly MSA. The data set consists of 36
debates comprising a total of 711 posts written by
326 users. The average number of posts per dis-
cussion is 19.75 and the average number of partic-
ipants per discussion is 13.08. Figure 1 shows an

5 Experiments and Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996322580645">
We use three metrics to evaluate the resulting sub-
groups: Purity (Manning et al., 2008), Entropy,
and F-measure. We ran several variations of the
system on the data set described in the previous
section. In one variation, we use the signed net-
work partitioning approach to detect subgroups.
In the other variations, we use the vector space
clustering approach. We experiment with differ-
ent clustering algorithms. We also run two experi-
ments to evaluate the contribution of both opinion-
target counts and latent similarity features on the
clustering accuracy. In one run, we use target-
opinion counts only. In the other run, we use latent
similarity features only. EM was used as the clus-
tering algorithm in these two runs. Table 1 shows
the results. All the results have been tested for sta-
tistical significance using a 2-tailed paired t-test.
The differences between the results of the different
methods shown in the table are statistically signif-
icant at the 0.05 level. The results show that the
clustering approach achieves better results than the
signed network partitioning approach. This can be
explained by the fact that the vector representa-
tion is a richer representation and encodes all the
discussants’ opinion information explicitly. The
results also show that Expectation Maximization
achieves significantly better results than the other
clustering algorithms that we experimented with.
The results also show that both latent text similar-
ity and opinion-target features are important and
contribute to the performance.

<abstract confidence="0.999640590909091">In this paper, we use Arabic natural language processing techniques to analyze Arabic debates. The goal is to identify how the participants in a discussion split into subgroups with contrasting opinions. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion with respect to the discussion topic and an opposing opinion to the members of other subgroups. We use opinion mining techniques to identify opinion expressions and determine their polarities and their targets. We opinion predictions to represent the discussion in one of two formal representations: signed attitude network or a space of attitude vectors. We identify opinion subgroups by partitioning the signed network representation or by clustering the vector space representation. We evaluate the system using a data set of labeled discussions and show that it achieves good results.</abstract>

Pang &amp; Lee (2008) and Liu &amp; Zhang (2012) wrote two recent comprehensive surveys about sentiment analysis and opinion mining techniques and applications. Previous work has proposed methods for identifying subjective text that expresses opinion and distinguishing it from objective text that presents factual information (Wiebe, 2000; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000a; Banea et al., 2008; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). Subjective text may express positive, negative, or neutral opinion. Previous work addressed the problem of identifying the polarity of subjective text (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000b; Hassan et al., 2010; Riloff et al., 2006). Many of the proposed methods for text polarity identification depend on the availability of polarity lexicons (i.e. lists of positive and negative words). Several approaches have been devised for building such lexicons (Turney and Littman, 2003; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006; Takamura et al., 2005; Hassan and Radev, 2010). Other research effor</context>

To capture this, we follow previous work (Guo and Diab, 2012; Dasigi et al., 2012) and apply Latent Dirichelet Allocation (LDA) topic models to the text written by the different participants.

The output is the list of participants in the discussion and the subgroup membership of each discussant. We describe the components of the pipeline in the following subsections. 3.1 Preprocessing The input to this component is a discussion thread in HTML format. We parse the HTML file to identify the posts, the discussants, and the thread structure. We transform the Arabic content of the posts and the discussant names that are written in Arabic to the Buckwalter encoding (Buckwalter, 2004). We use AMIRAN (Diab, 2009), a system for processing Arabic text, to tokenize the text and identify noun phrases. 3.2 Identifying Opinionated Text To identify opinion-bearing text, we start from the word level. We identify the polarized words that appear in text by looking each word up in a lexicon of Arabic polarized words. In our experiments, we use Sifat (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012b), a lexicon of 3982 Arabic adjectives labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. The polarity of a word may be dependant on its context (Wilson et al., 2005). For example, a positive word that appears in a negated context should be treat</context>

Previous work addressed the problem of identifying the polarity of subjective text (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000b; Hassan et al., 2010; Riloff et al., 2006).

The data set consists of 36 debates comprising a total of 711 posts written by 326 users. The average number of posts per discussion is 19.75 and the average number of participants per discussion is 13.08. Figure 1 shows an example from the data. 5 Experiments and Results We use three metrics to evaluate the resulting subgroups: Purity (Manning et al., 2008), Entropy, and F-measure. We ran several variations of the system on the data set described in the previous section. In one variation, we use the signed network partitioning approach to detect subgroups. In the other variations, we use the vector space clustering approach. We experiment with different clustering algorithms.

The results show that the clustering the vector space representation achieves better results than partitioning the signed network representation. 2 Previous Work Our work is related to a large body of research on opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Pang &amp; Lee (2008) and Liu &amp; Zhang (2012) wrote two recent comprehensive surveys about sentiment analysis and opinion mining techniques and applications. Previous work has proposed methods for identifying subjective text that expresses opinion and distinguishing it from objective text that presents factual information (Wiebe, 2000; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000a; Banea et al., 2008; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). Subjective text may express positive, negative, or neutral opinion. Previous work addressed the problem of identifying the polarity of subjective text (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000b; Hassan et al., 2010; Riloff et al., 2006). Many of the proposed methods for text polarity identification depend on the availability of polarity lexicons (i.e. lists of positive and negative words). Several approaches have been devised for building such lexicons (Turney and Littman, 2003; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006; Takamura et a</context>

We use AMIRAN (Diab, 2009), a system for processing Arabic text, to tokenize the text and identify noun phrases. 3.2 Identifying Opinionated Text To identify opinion-bearing text, we start from the word level. We identify the polarized words that appear in text by looking each word up in a lexicon of Arabic polarized words. In our experiments, we use Sifat (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012b), a lexicon of 3982 Arabic adjectives labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. The polarity of a word may be dependant on its context (Wilson et al., 2005). For example, a positive word that appears in a negated context should be treated as expressing negative opinion rather than positive. To identify the polarity of a word given the sentence it appears in, we use SAMAR (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2012b), a system for Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis for Arabic social media genres. SAMAR labels a sentence that contains an opinion expression as positive, negative, or neutral taking into account the context of the opinion expression. The reported accuracy of SAMAR on different data sets ranges between 84% and 95% for subjectivity classification and 6</context>

Several approaches have been devised for building such lexicons (Turney and Littman, 2003; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006; Takamura et al., 2005; Hassan and Radev, 2010). Other research efforts focused on identifying the holders and the targets of opinion (Zhai et al., 2010; Popescu and Etzioni, 2007; Bethard et al., 2004). Opinion mining and sentiment analysis techniques have been used in various applications. One example of such applications is identifying perspectives (Grefenstette et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2006) which is most similar to the topic of this paper. For example, in (Lin et al., 2006), the authors experiment with several supervised and statistical models to capture how perspectives are expressed at the document and the sentence levels. Laver et al. (2003) proposed a method for extracting perspectives from political texts. They used their method to</context>
