The paper describes work on applying a gen-
eral purpose natural language processing system
to transfer-based interactive translation. Trans-
fer takes place at the level of Quasi Logical Form
(QLF), a contextually sensitive logical form rep-
resentation which is deep enough for dealing with
cross-linguistic differences. Theoretical arguments
and experimental results are presented to support
the claim that this framework has good proper-
ties in terms of modularity, compositionality, re-
versibility and monotonicity.

1 INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.99456075">
In this paper we describe a translation project
whose aim is to build an experimental Bilingual
Conversation Interpreter (BCI) which will allow
communication through typed text between two
monolingual humans using different languages (cf
Miike et al, 1988). The choice of languages for the
prototype system is English and Swedish. Input
sentences are analysed by the Core Language En-
gine (CLE&apos;) as far as the level of Quasi Logical
Form (QLF; Alshawi, 1990), and then, instead of
further ambiguity resolution, undergo transfer into
another QLF having constants and predicates cor-
responding to word senses in the other language.
The transfer rules used in this process correspond
to a certain kind of meaning postulate. The CLE
then generates an output sentence from the target

language QLF, using the same linguistic data as
is used for analysis of that language.
QLFs were selected as the appropriate level for
transfer because they are far enough removed from
surface linguistic form to provide the flexibility re-
quired by cross-linguistic differences. On the other
hand, the linguistic, unification-based processing
involved in creating them can be carried out effi-
ciently and without the need to reason about the
domain or context; the QLF language has con-
structs for explicit representation of contextually
sensitive aspects of interpretation.
When it is necessary, for correct translation, to
resolve an ambiguity present at QLF level, the BCI
system interacts with the source language user to
make the necessary decision, asking for a choice
between word sense paraphrases or between alter-
native partial bracketings of the sentence. There
is thus a strong connection between our choice of
a representation sensitive to context and the use
of interaction to resolve context dependent ambi-
guities, but in this paper we concentrate on repre-
sentational and transfer issues.

2.1 CLE Processing Phases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990138272727273">
A coarse view of the CLE architecture is that it
consists of a linguistic analysis phase followed by
a contextual interpretation phase. The output of
the first phase is a set of alternative QLF analy-
ses of a sentence, while the output of the second
is an RQLF (resolved QLF) representation of the
interpretation of an utterance:
Sentence —linguistic analysis—). QLFs
QLFs —contextual interpretation-4 RQLF.
Deriving a fairly conventional Logical Form (LF)
from the RQLF is then a simple formal mapping
which removes the information in the RQLF that
is not concerned with truth conditions.
Linguistic analysis and contextual interpreta-
tion each consist of several subphases. For anal-
ysis these are: orthography, morphological anal-
ysis, syntactic analysis (parsing), and (composi-
tional) semantic analysis. Apart from the first,
these analysis subphases are based on the unifica-
tion grammar paradigm, and they all use declara-
tive bidirectional rules.
When the CLE is being used as an interface to a
computerized information system (e.g. a database
system), its purpose is to derive an LF represen-
tation giving the truth conditions of an utterance
input by a user. The LF language is based on
first order predicate logic extended with general-
ized quantifiers and some other higher order con-
structs (Alshawi and van Eijck, 1989). For ex-
ample, in a context where she can refer to Mary
Smith, and one to &amp;quot;a car&amp;quot;, a possible LF for She
hired one is:
quant (exists ,C , [car 1 ,
quant (exists ,E, [event ,E3 ,
[past, [hirel E ,mary_smith , ) ) .
This can be paraphrased as &amp;quot;There is a car C, and
an event E such that, in the past, E is a hiring
event by Mary Smith of C.&amp;quot; In this notation, quan-
tified formulae consist of a generalized quantifier,
a variable, a restriction and a scope; square brack-
ets are used for the application of predicates and
operators to their arguments. To arrive at such
LF representations, a number of intermediate lev-
els of representation are produced by successive
modular components.
Generation of linguistic expressions in the CLE
takes place from QLFs (or from RQLFs by map-
ping them to suitable QLFs). Since the rules
used during the analysis phase are declarative and
bidirectional, these are also used for generation.
To achieve computationally efficient analysis and
generation, the rules are pre-compiled in different
ways for application in the two directions. Gen-
eration uses the semantic-head driven algorithm
(Shieber et at, 1990).

2.2 The QLF Language
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997716608695652">
The QLF representations produced for a sen-
tence are neutral with respect to the choice of ref-
erents for pronouns and definite descriptions, and
relations implied by compound nouns and ellip-
sis. They are also neutral with respect to other
ambiguities corresponding to alternative scopings
of quantifiers and operators and to the collec-
tive/distributive and referential/attributive dis-
tinctions. The QLF is thus the level of represen-
tation encoding the results of compositional lin-
guistic analysis independently of contextually sen-
sitive aspects of understanding. These aspects
are addressed by the contextual interpretation
phase which has the following subphases: quan-
tifier scoping (Moran 1988), reference resolution
(Alshawi 1990), and plausibility judgement.
The QLF language is a superset of the LF
language containing additional expressions corre-
sponding, for example, to unresolved anaphors.
More specifically, there are two additional
term constructs (anaphoric terms and quanti-
fied terms), and one additional formula construct
(anaphoric formulae):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.661990333333333">
a_term( Category , Entity Var, , Restriction).
q_term( Category ,EntityVar , Restriction) .
a_f orm( Category, ,PredVar , Restriction) .
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.894150933333333">
These QLF constructs contain syntactic and
morphological information in the Category and
logical (truth-conditional) information in the
Restriction, itself a QLF formula binding the vari-
able. A QLF from which the LF for She hired one
could have been derived is:
[past,
[hire,
q_term(&lt;t=quant,n=sing&gt;,
Ejevent,E)),
a_term(&lt;t=ref,p=pro,1=she,n=sing&gt;,
Y,[female,Y]),
q_term(&lt;t=quant,n=sing&gt;,
C,a_form(&lt;t=pred,1=one&gt;,
P. [P,C]))33.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999981">
in which categories are shown as lists of feature-
value specifications (the feature shown are t for
QLF expression type, n for number, p for phrase
type, and 1 for lexical information). The differ-
ences between the QLF shown here and the LF
shown earlier are that the quantified terms have
been scoped, the anaphoric term for she has been
resolved to Mary Smith, and the anaphoric NP
restriction implicit in one has been resolved using
the predicate car.
The RQLF representation of an utterance in-
cludes all the information from the QLF, together
with the resolutions of QLF constructs made dur-
ing the contextual interpretation phase. For ex-
ample, the referent of an a_term is unified with
the a_term variable.
Some constraints on plausibility can be ap-
plied at the QLF level before a full interpreta-
tion has been derived. This is because most of
the predicate-argument structure of an utterance
has been determined at that point, allowing, in
particular, the application of sortal constraints
expected by predicates of their arguments. Sor-
tal constraints cut down on structural (e.g. at-
tachment) ambiguity, and on word sense ambigu-
ity, the latter being particularly important for the
translation application in the context of large vo-
cabularies.

3 REPRESENTATION LEVELS
FOR TRANSFER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994465753425">
The representational structures on which trans-
fer operates must contain information correspond-
ing to several linguistic levels, including syntax
and semantics. For transfer to be general, it must
operate recursively on input representations. We
call the level of representation on which this re-
cursion operates the &amp;quot;organizing&amp;quot; level; semantic
structure is the natural choice, since the basic re-
quirement of translation is that it preserves mean-
ing.
Syntactic phrase structure transfer, or deep-
syntax transfer (e.g. Thurmair 1990, Nagao and
Tsujii 1986) results in complex transfer rules,
and the predicate-argument structure which is re-
quired for the application of sortal restrictions is
not represented.
McCord&apos;s (1988, 1989) organizing level appears
to be fhat of surface syntax, with additional deep
syntactic and semantic content attached to nodes.
As we have argued, this level is not optimal, which
may be related to the fact that McCord&apos;s sys-
tem is explicitly not symmetrical: different gram-
mars are used for the analysis and synthesis of the
same language, which are viewed as quite differ-
ent tasks. Isabelle and Macklovitch (1986) argue
against such asymmetry between analysis and syn-
thesis on the grounds that, although it is tempting
as a short-cut to building a structure sufficiently
well-specified for synthesis to take place, asym-
metry means that the transfer component must
contain a lot of knowledge about the target lan-
guage, with dire consequences for the modularity
of the system and the reusability of different parts
of it. In the BCI, however, the transfer rules con-
tain only cross-linguistic knowledge, allowing the
analysis and generation to make use of exactly the
same data.
Kaplan et al (1989) allow multiple levels of
representation to take part in the transfer rela-
tion. However, Sadler et al (1990) point out that
the particular approach to realizing this taken by
Kaplan et al has problems of its own and does
not cleanly separate monolingual from contrastive
knowledge.
The CLE processing subphases offer three se-
mantic representations of different depth as can-
didates for an appropriate transfer level, namely
QLF, RQLF and LF. At the LF level, sortal re-
strictions can be applied, but the form of noun
phrase descriptions used and also information on
topicalization is no longer present; the LF rep-
resentation is too abstract for transfer. On the
other hand, not all the information appearing in
the RQLF about how QLF constructs have been
resolved is necessary for translation. Resolved ref-
erents are not an adequate generator input for def-
inite descriptions in the target language, since the
view of the referent in the source is lost during
translation. Another case is that translation from
resolved ellipsis can result in unwieldy target sen-
tences. In arguing for QLF-level transfer, we are
asserting that predicate-argument relations of the
type used in QLF are the appropriate organizing
level for compositional transfer, while not denying
the need for syntactic information to ensure that,
for example, topichood or the given/new distinc-
tion is preserved.
Finally, in contrast to systems such as Rosetta
(Landsbergen, 1986) which depend on stating rule
by rule correspondences between source and target
grammars, we wish to make the monolingual de-
scriptions as independent as possible from the task
of translating between two languages. Apart from
</bodyText>

its attractions from a theoretical point of view,
this has practical advantages in allowing gram-
mars to be reused for different language pairs and
for applications other than translation.

4 QLF TRANSFER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994347368421">
QLF transfer involves taking a QLF analysis of
a source sentence, say QLF1, and deriving from it
another expression, QLF2, from which it is possi-
ble to generate a sentence in the target language.
Leaving aside unresolved referential expressions,
the main difference between QLF1 and QLF2 is
that they will contain constants, particularly pred-
icate constants, that originate in word sense en-
tries from the lexicons of the respective languages.
If more than one candidate source language QLF
exists, the appropriate one is selected by present-
ing the user with choices of word sense paraphrases
and of bracketings relating to differences in the
syntactic analyses from which the QLFs were de-
rived.
A transfer rule specifies a pair of QLF patterns.
The left hand side matches QLF expressions for
one language and the right hand side matches
those for the other:

&lt;Operator&gt;
&lt;QLF2 subexpression pattern›).
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97906005882353">
If the operator is == then the rule is bidirectional.
Otherwise, a single direction of applicability is in-
dicated by use of one of the operators &gt;= or =&lt;.
Transfer rules are applied recursively, this pro-
cess following the recursive structure of the source
QLF. In order to allow transfer between struc-
turally different QLFs, rules with &apos;transfer vari-
ables&apos; need to be used. These variables, which
take the form tr(atom), show how subexpressions
in the source QLF correspond to subexpressions
translating them in the target QLF. For exam-
ple, the following rule expresses an equivalence
between the English to be called (&amp;quot;I am called
John&amp;quot;), and the Swedish heta (&amp;quot;Jag heter John&amp;quot;).
trans(Ecall_name,
tr(ev),

tr(name))
= =
[hetal,tr(ev),tr(ag),tr(name)3).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994281086956522">
Transfer rules often correspond directly to inter-
lingual meaning postulates: when the expressions
in a transfer rule are formulae, the symbols ==, &gt;=,
and =&lt; can be read as the logical operators &lt;--&gt;,
--&gt;, and &lt;-- respectively. A rule like
trans(Cand, [badl,X], [luckl,X33
==
[oturi,x])
translating between the English bad luck and the
Swedish Our, can be interpreted in this way.
We will now assess the method&apos;s strengths and
weaknesses, as they have manifested themselves in
practice. We will pay particular attention to the
criteria of expressiveness, compositionality, sim-
plicity, reversibility and monotonicity.
We take the last point first, since it is the most
straightforward one. Since rules are applied purely
nondeterministically and by pure unification, we
get monotonicity &amp;quot;for free&amp;quot; — although there is a
case for disallowing transfer by decomposition of
a complex QLF structure which directly matches
one side of a transfer rule. The other points need
more discussion.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.97386">
4.1 Expressiveness
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980923076923">
Since we are intentionally limiting ourselves by
not allowing access to full syntactic information
(but only to that placed in QLF categories) in the
transfer phase, it is legitimate to wonder whether
the formalism can really be sufficiently expressive.
Here, we will attempt to answer this criticism; we
begin by noting that shortcomings in this area can
be of several distinct kinds. Sometimes, a formal-
ism can appear to make it necessary to write many
rules, where one feels intuitively that one should
be enough; we treat this kind of problem under the
heading of compositionality. In other cases, the
difficulty is rather that there does not appear to
be any way of expressing the rule at all in terms of
the given formalism. In our case, a fair proportion
of problems that at first seem to fall into this cate-
gory can be eliminated by having adequate mono-
lingual grammars and using the target grammar
as a filter; the idea is to allow the transfer com-
ponent to produce unacceptable QLFs which are
filtered out by fully constrained target grammars.
A good example of the use of this technique is
the English definite article, which in Swedish can
be translated as a gender-dependent article, but
preferably is omitted; however, an article is oblig-
atory before an adjective. Solving this problem

at transfer level is not possible, since the transfer
component has no way of knowing that a piece of
logical form will be realized as an adjective; there
are many cases where an adjective-noun combina-
tion in English is best translated as a compound
noun in Swedish. Exploiting the fact that the rele-
vant constraint is present in the Swedish grammar,
however, the &amp;quot;transfer-and-filter&amp;quot; method reduces
the problem to two simple lexical rules. Sortal re-
strictions at the target end can also be used as a
filter in a similar way.

4.2 Simplicity and reversibility
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991371368421053">
The most obvious way to put the case with re-
gard to simplicity is by giving a count of the vari-
ous categories of rule, and providing evidence that
there is a substantial proportion of rules which are
simple in our framework, but would not necessar-
ily be so in others.
The transfer component currently contains 718
rules. 576 of these (80.2%) have the property that
both the right- and left-hand sides are atomic.
502 members of this first group (69.9%) translate
senses of single words to senses of single words;
the remaining 74 (10.3%) translate atomic con-
stants representing the senses of complex syntactic
constructions, most commonly verbs taking parti-
cles, reflexives, or complementizers. An example
is the following rule, which defines an equivalence
between English care about (&amp;quot;John cares about
Mary&amp;quot;) and Swedish bry sig om (&amp;quot;John bryr sig
om Mary&amp;quot;, lit. &amp;quot;John cares himself about Mary&amp;quot;).

Since vocabulary has primarily been selected
with regard to utility (we have, for example, made
considerable use of frequency dictionaries (Allen
1970)), we think it reasonable to claim that QLF-
based transfer is simplifying the construction of
transfer rules in a substantial proportion of the
commonly encountered cases.
On the score of reversibility, we will once again
count cases; here we find that 659 (91.8%) of the
rules are reversible, 17 (2.4%) work only in the
English-Swedish direction, and 42 (5.8%) only in
the Swedish-English direction. These also seem to
be fairly good figures.

4.3 Compositionality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998834">
As in any rule-based system, &amp;quot;compositionality&amp;quot;
corresponds to the extent to which it is necessary
to provide special mechanisms to cover cases of ir-
regular interactions between rules. As far as we
know, there is no accepted benchmark for testing
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997341">

<bodyText confidence="0.994021814432989">
compositionality of transfer; what we have done,
as a first step in this direction, is to select six com-
mon types of complex transfer, and eleven com-
mon contexts in which they can occur. These are
summarized in tables 1 and 2 respectively. Each
complex transfer type is represented by a sample
rule, as shown in table 1; the question is the ex-
tent to which the complex transfer rules continue
to function in the different contexts (table 2).
To test transfer compositionality properly, it is
not sufficient simply to note which rule/context
combinations are handled correctly; after all, it is
always possible to create a completely ad hoc so-
lution by simply adding one transfer rule for each
combination. The problem must rather be posed
in the following terms: if there is a single rule for
each complex transfer type, and a number of rules
for each context, how many extra rules must be
added to cover special combinations? It is this
issue we will address.
The actual results of the tests were as follows.
There were 124 meaningful combinations (some
constructions could not be passivized); in 103 of
these, transfer was perfectly compositional, and no
extra rule was needed. For example, the English
sentence for the combination &amp;quot;Verb to adjective +
WH-question&amp;quot; is How much does John owe Mary.
The corresponding Swedish sentence is Hur my-
cket dr John skyldig Mary? (&amp;quot;How much is John
indebted-to Mary?&amp;quot;), and the two QLFs are&apos;:
[whq,
[pres,
[owe_have_to_pay,
q_term(&lt;t=quant,n=sing&gt;,A,[event,A7),
a_term(&lt;t=ref,p=name&gt;,
B,[name_of,B,john]),
q_term(&lt;t=quant,1=wh&gt;,C,[quantity,C3),
a_term(&lt;t=ref,p=name&gt;,
D,[name_of,D,mary])773
[whq,
(present,
[vara,
q_term(&lt;t=quant ,n=sing&gt; , A , [state , A) ) ,
[skyldig_ngn_ngt ,
a_term(&lt;t=rei ,p=name&gt; ,
B, Ename_of ,B j ohn7 )
a_t erm(&lt;t =ref ,p=name&gt;,
C, [name_of , C , mary) ) ,
q_term(&lt;t=quant ,1=wh&gt; ,D, [quantity , DJ )7 737
It should be evident that the complex transfer
rule defining the equivalence between owe and vara
skyldig,
trans ( [owe_have_to_pay ,
q_term(&lt;t=quant , n=s ing&gt; , A , [event , A] ) ,
tr(ag),tr(sum),tr(obj)]
==
[vara,
q_term(&lt;t=quant ,n=sing&gt; , A, [state , A] ) ,
[skyldig_ngn_ngt,
tr(ag),tr(obj),tr(sum)73).
is quite unaffected by being used in the context of
a WH-question.
Of the remaining 21 rule/context/direction
triples, seven failed for basically uninteresting rea-
sons: the combination &amp;quot;Perfect tense + Passive-
to-active&amp;quot; did not generate in English, and the six
sentences with the object-raising rule all failed in
the Swedish-English direction due to the transfer
component&apos;s current inability to create a function-
application from a closed form. The final fourteen
failures are significant from our point of view, and
it is interesting to note that all of them resulted
from mismatches in the scope of tense and nega-
tion operators.
The question now becomes that of ascertaining
the generality of the extra rules that need to be
added to solve these fourteen unwanted interac-
tions. Analysis showed that it was possible to
add 26 extra rules (two of which were relevant
here), which reordered the scopes of tense, nega-
tion and modifiers, and accounted for the scope
differences between the English and Swedish QLFs
arising from the general divergences in word-order
and negation of main verbs. These solved ten
of the outstanding cases. For example, the com-
bination &amp;quot;Different particles + Negated&amp;quot; is John
doesn&apos;t like Mary in English and John tycker inte
om Mary (lit.: &amp;quot;John thinks not about Mary&amp;quot;) in
Swedish; the QLF-pair is:
[pres,
[not,
[like,
q_term(&lt;t=quant,n=sing&gt;,A,[event,A]),
a_term(&lt;t=ref,p=name&gt;,
B,[name_of,B,john]),
a_term(&lt;t=ret,p=name&gt;,

The extra rule here,
trans( Epres , [not ,tr (body)] ==
[not, [present , tr (body)] )
reorders the scopes of the negation and present-
tense operators, but does not need to access the
interior structure of the QLF (the &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; vari-
able); this turns out to be the case for most inter-
actions of negation, VP-modification and complex
transfer. It is thus not surprising that a small
number of similar rules covers most of the cases.
The four bad interactions left all involved the
English verb to be; these were the combinations
&amp;quot;Passive to active + VP modifier&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Idiomatic
use of PP + negation&amp;quot;, which failed to transfer
in either direction. Here, there is no general solu-
tion involving the addition of a small number of
extra rules, since the problem is caused by an oc-
currence of to be on the English side that is not
matched by an occurrence of the corresponding
Swedish word on the other. The solution must
rather be to add an extra rule for each complex
transfer rule in the relevant class to cover the bad
interaction. To solve the specific examples in the
test set, two extra rules were thus required.
Summarizing the picture, the tests revealed that
all bad interactions between the transfer rules and
contexts shown here could be removed by adding
four extra rules to cover the 124 possible interac-
tions. In a general perspective (viewing the rules
as representatives of their respective classes), the
rule-interaction problems exemplified by the con-
crete collisions were solved by adding
• 26 general rules to cover certain standard
scope mismatches caused by verb-inversion
and negation.
• two extra rules (one for present and one for
past tense) for each complex transfer rule of
either the &amp;quot;Idiomatic use of PP&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Active
to Passive&amp;quot; types, to cover idiosyncratic in-
teractions of these with negation and VP-
modification respectively.
We view these results as very promising: there
were few bad interactions, and those that ex-
isted were of a regular nature that could be coun-
teracted without fear of further unwelcome side-
effects. This gives good grounds for hoping that
the system could be scaled up to a practically use-
ful size without suffering the usual fate of drown-
ing in a sea of ad hoc fixes.

5 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951923076923">
The current implementation includes analysis,
transfer, and generation modules, sizable gram-
mars with morphological, syntactic and semantic
rules for English and Swedish, and an experimen-
tal set of transfer rules for this language pair. Rel-
ative to the size of the grammars, the lexicons are
still small (approximately 2000 and 1000 words re-
spectively). About 250 entries for each language
have been added for a specific domain (car hire),
which makes possible moderately unconstrained
conversation on this topic; the system, including
the facilities for interactive resolution of trans-
lation problems, has been tested on a corpus of
about 400 sentences relating to the domain. For
short sentences typical of the car hire domain, me-
dian total processing times for analysis, transfer
and generation are around ten seconds when run-
ning under Quintus Prolog on a SUN SPARCsta-
tion 2.
We are currently investigating a different QLF
representation of ense, aspect and modality which
should increase the transfer compositionality for
the operator cases we have discussed in this pa-
per, as well as allowing more flexible resolution
of temporal relations in applications other than
translation.

<abstract confidence="0.995367583333334">The paper describes work on applying a general purpose natural language processing system to transfer-based interactive translation. Transfer takes place at the level of Quasi Logical Form (QLF), a contextually sensitive logical form representation which is deep enough for dealing with cross-linguistic differences. Theoretical arguments and experimental results are presented to support the claim that this framework has good properties in terms of modularity, compositionality, reversibility and monotonicity.</abstract>

The choice of languages for the prototype system is English and Swedish. Input sentences are analysed by the Core Language Engine (CLE&apos;) as far as the level of Quasi Logical Form (QLF; Alshawi, 1990), and then, instead of further ambiguity resolution, undergo transfer into another QLF having constants and predicates corresponding to word senses in the other language.

The QLF is thus the level of representation encoding the results of compositional linguistic analysis independently of contextually sensitive aspects of understanding. These aspects are addressed by the contextual interpretation phase which has the following subphases: quantifier scoping (Moran 1988), reference resolution (Alshawi 1990), and plausibility judgement. The QLF language is a superset of the LF language containing additional expressions corresponding, for example, to unresolved anaphors. More specifically, there are two additional term constructs (anaphoric terms and quantified terms), and one additional formula construct (anaphoric formulae): a_term( Category , Entity Var, , Restriction). q_term( Category ,EntityVar , Restriction) . a_f orm( Category, ,PredVar , Restriction) .

Another case is that translation from resolved ellipsis can result in unwieldy target sentences. In arguing for QLF-level transfer, we are asserting that predicate-argument relations of the type used in QLF are the appropriate organizing level for compositional transfer, while not denying the need for syntactic information to ensure that, for example, topichood or the given/new distinction is preserved. Finally, in contrast to systems such as Rosetta (Landsbergen, 1986) which depend on stating rule by rule correspondences between source and target grammars, we wish to make the monolingual descriptions as independent as possible from the task of translating between two languages. Apart from 163 its attractions from a theoretical point of view, this has practical advantages in allowing grammars to be reused for different language pairs and for applications other than translation. 4 QLF TRANSFER QLF transfer involves taking a QLF analysis of a source sentence, say QLF1, and deriving from it another expression, QLF2, from which it is possible to generate a sente</context>

For transfer to be general, it must operate recursively on input representations. We call the level of representation on which this recursion operates the &amp;quot;organizing&amp;quot; level; semantic structure is the natural choice, since the basic requirement of translation is that it preserves meaning. Syntactic phrase structure transfer, or deepsyntax transfer (e.g. Thurmair 1990, Nagao and Tsujii 1986) results in complex transfer rules, and the predicate-argument structure which is required for the application of sortal restrictions is not represented.

For transfer to be general, it must operate recursively on input representations. We call the level of representation on which this recursion operates the &amp;quot;organizing&amp;quot; level; semantic structure is the natural choice, since the basic requirement of translation is that it preserves meaning. Syntactic phrase structure transfer, or deepsyntax transfer (e.g. Thurmair 1990, Nagao and Tsujii 1986) results in complex transfer rules, and the predicate-argument structure which is required for the application of sortal restrictions is not represented. McCord&apos;s (1988, 1989) organizing level appears to be fhat of surface syntax, with additional deep syntactic and semantic content attached to nodes. As we have argued, this level is not optimal, which may be related to the fact that McCord&apos;s system is explicitly not symmetrical: different grammars are used for the analysis and synthesis of the same language, which are viewed as quite different tasks.
