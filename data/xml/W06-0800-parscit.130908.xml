There has been a long standing interest in using various forms of deep natural language processing to
improve information or document retrieval. We have a Cambridge Language Research (CLRU) memo
from 1964 by Yorick Wilks which describes an application to text searching of a clear precursor of his
later well-known machine translation system. We are also aware of even earlier work in the CLRU on
information retrieval by Karen Sparck Jones and Margaret Masterman.
This interest has continued right up to the present day, but successes have been few and far between. In
general search engines are based on statistical modeling of documents which lacks at least transparent
and visible knowledge of language in any conventional sense. Although many continue to believe search
engines which do not, for example, recognise that words have multiple senses, cannot do a good job of
the task of matching queries and documents, the fact is that most of the time most users of Google find
enough relevant documents in the first page or two of hits without such linguistic sophistication.
Computational Linguistics has progressed enormously in the past few years. CL has made significant
contributions to the specialised areas of information retrieval, most notably question answering.
However, the dominant use model for information retrieval remains the classic search engine task,
in which a short key word query is used to generate a ranked list from a pre-indexed heterogeneous
collection of documents, and very little work from computational linguistics has been used in the
development of these engines.
This workshop will provide a forum to discuss why this is the case, and how to achieve a better take up
of what computational linguistic technology within the search engine community.
We would like to thank our two invited speakers, Jamie Callan and C´ecile Paris, in particular Jamie
who traveled from the US to Australia especially to take part in the workshop, all the authors (whether
their papers were accepted or not) and our program committee. The workshop could not have happened
without your efforts!
We would like to acknowledge the kind sponsorship of the Cambridge University Press.
