This paper introduces an intuitive search
environment for casual and novice Chinese
users over Internet. The system consists of four
components, a concept network, a query
reformulation model, a standard search engine,
and an automatic summarizer. When the user
enters one or more fairly general and vague
terms, the search engine returns an initial
answer set, and at the same time pipes the query
to the concept network that connects thousands
of conceptual nodes, each referring to a specific
concept for a given domain and pointing to a
number of associated conceptual terms. If the
concept is located in the network, the related
conceptual terms are displayed. The user has the
option of using one or more of these specific
terms to reformulate the next round of searches.
Such search iterations continue until the user&apos; s
ultimate information seeking goal is reached.
For each search iteration, auto summarizer
presents the main theme of the document
retrieved and an optional text-to-speech engine
can read out the output summary if the user
prefers.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994278">
Internet is changing the world, and at the same
time changing people s information seeking
behaviour. Traditionally, information searchers
are trained professionals working in libraries or
other special technical or scientific fields. They
have developed a variety of techniques and
heuristics for addressing information seeking
difficulties in the environment typically
dominated by Boolean query formula. These
Boolean information retrieval systems are
normally commercial and non-interactive
systems and the searches conducted in such
settings are exact-match and set-based retrieval
from databases of indexed citations and
abstracts of documents (Koenemann and Belkin,
1996). With the dramatic explosion of
information sources over Internet,. current user
population is no longer restricted to professional
searchers. Practically it includes everyone in
life. The majority of these users, however, are
either casual or novice or both. Casual users,
such as browsers of news stories, look for
interesting information rather than information
relevant to a specific need (Stadnyk and Kass,
1992). Novice users may have a specific
information topic, but due to little or no training
in search and retrieval, they don&apos; t know how
to make best use of the available operators and
tools. On the whole, query formulation is one
problem facing both types of information users
(Turtle, 1994). Internet users all have difficulty
in mapping their intent to any logical query
structure. They prefer limiting their searches to
one or a simple list of terms, while seeking help
from the system to guide them to achieve their
ultimate information goal.
In this paper we introduce an integrated system
that combines a standard search system with a
query reformulation model, a pre-constructed
concept network, an automatic document
summarizer, and an optional text-to-speech
(TTS) engine. Together, these intelligent
components provide intuitive human
intelligence to the Chinese users over Internet.
The integrated system not only guides and
navigates the user to perform searches in a
humanly conversational way, but also makes
and delivers the retrieved information back to
the user in a simple, succinct, and easily
comprehensible manner.

2. System Configuration

Figure 1 and Figure 2 present the overall system
configuration and data flow of the integrated
system. The system consists of four main
components: a concept net, a query
</bodyText>

reformulation model, a standard search engine,
and a summarizer. There is also an optional
component, i.e., if the user chooses, she can
launch a text-to-speech (TI&apos;S) engine to read out
the automatically generated summary.
The concept net is a network of conceptual
terms. It is normally constructed for a specific
domain with certain amount of human
intervention. A link connects each pair of
related concepts in the network, specifying the
semantic relationship between them. For the
current economic news domain, the main types
of relationships include, but not limited to,
canonical form of, synonym of, hyponym of,
hypernym of, part of, product of, member of,
etc.
The system accepts users queries expressed in
Chinese natural language. The query may
contain the terms that are already stored in the
concept network. Unlike professional searchers,
Most of Chinese web users have little training in
information retrieval or have no prior
knowledge or experience in it. They may not
even know where to search and how to search.
To perform an initial search, they tend to use
one or more very general or vague terms. Under
such circumstances the system guidance and
navigation are extremely important. One unique
functionality of this integrated system is to
intuitively lead a casual or novice user from a
more general search to a more specific search
until the user becomes satisfied with the
returned information.
For each search conducted, the query
reformulation model looks up the concept
network for more specific terms that are relevant
to the more general terms in the earlier query.
For example, if a general term is a company s
name, then its subsidiaries, its products, its stock
symbol, its industrial code, etc. are considered
to be specific information about the company.
The query reformulation model either replaces
or expands the original query with these related
terms and formulates them into a standardized
format. Search operators, such as AND, OR,
NOT, NEAR, etc. are used to connect the terms
selected. Assigned to each individual term is a
different weight so as to reshape a new search
emphasis.
The standard search engine performs the search
against the targeted database using the
reformulated query with N relevant documents
returned in an order of the relevance to the
query (N is a number defined by the user and it
is 10 by default). At the same time, the concept
terms in the original query and the
corresponding specific terms extracted from the
concept network are also displayed. The web
interface is designed in a way that makes each
of the specific terms searchable. The user has
the choice to select any of these specific terms
to form a new query. The search engine takes
the new query to perform the next round of
search, actually a more specific search based on
the user&apos; s intention. The iteration continues -
the more specific search while using more
specific terms, the closer the user will be to his
desired information - though he can stop
anytime after each search iteration to examine
the retrieved documents.
A text summarizer automatically generates the
summaries for the documents each search
iteration returns (Liu and Zhou, 2000). Together
with the output summary, a selection panel that
includes the key-word list (average 3 to 6
words), the headline, and the leading text
(usually the first 100 characters) of the
document is displayed. The selection panel
provides the user with an ability of examining
the retrieved information more efficiently. By
glancing over the key words, the user should be
able to grasp the main idea of the document. He
can make a decision whether to skip the
document or continue to learn more about it. If
his choice is the latter, he can move up to the
headline or the leading text that offer more
about the document content. He can, of course,
move further to look at the summary that is
supposedly a mini-document of the original. If
the user decides to move further to read the
entire document, then he will click on the
hyperlinked title or headline of the document.
The integrated system will go directly online,
usually a specific website, to grab the document
for the user.
Associated with the summarizer is an optional
text-to-speech (TTS) engine. The user can
choose either to read the document himself or
get relaxed by simply listening to the system&apos; s
voice output.

3. An Example Search and
Summarization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9837511875">
In this section we use an example to illustrate
how the integrated system works.
Suppose that there is a Chinese user who has no
experience in search over Internet, neither has
any idea regarding where or how to do it. He
just heard some news about RE (Legend, one
of the biggest computer manufacturing
companies in China) and wants to find it out
from Internet. When we make our integrated
search and summarization system available to
him, the only word in his mind is the name of
the company IKE, (Legend). So, he enters this
fairly general term as his first search query and
presses the Go button (see Figure 3 (a)).
Figure 3 (b) shows what the integrated system
returns to the user in response to his initial
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989939">

<bodyText confidence="0.96937421">
search. In addition to the top 10 most relevant
documents, two more specific terms are
extracted from the pre-constructed concept
network, i.e., getial (Legend Corporation)
and RE,Itig (Legend computer). In the
concept network these two terms are found to be
closely associated with the initial search
term VE (Legend). When the user examines
the top relevant document returned, he finds that
a selection panel is displayed on the interface
that is associated with this (or each) returned
document. If looking up from the last row, he
notices three key words that are extracted from
the document, i.e., IREAR1 (Legend
Corporation), IEP.,1 (electronic company),
litgIi PrOtog (internationally well-known
brand). By putting these three key words
together the user should be able to grasp the
main idea expressed in the document
(something like &amp;quot;Legend Corporation is an
electronic company who has some
internationally well-known brand names&amp;quot; ). If
the user wants to know more about the
document, he can move up to click the button
14M101 (automatic summarization) or read
the leading text (in this case the first 50
characters from the document are extracted). If
the user wants to refer to the entire document,
he can do it by clicking on the headline. The
integrated system will go live to Internet to
retrieve the entire original text.
But, what if the user is not satisfied with the
current answer set? Then, he has an option of
kicking off another round of search. To do that
he may want to narrow down his search by
choosing between av,xial (Legend
Corporation) and ipteci-g (Legend
computer) - the two relatively speaking, more
specific terms associated with his initial query
IRE (Legend). Let us suppose that the user
decides to select REAM (Legend
Corporation) to conduct a new but more
specific search. The search can be activated by
simply clicking on this selected term. Figure 3
(c) shows the results of this search iteration.
Again, in addition to the top 10 most relevant
documents returned, more than 20 related terms
are extracted in this round from the concept
network that are considered to be conceptually
relevant to the search termIKEZIffl (Legend
Corporation). These terms represent even more
specific concepts comparing to the two specific
terms returned in the first round. A detailed
examination of these terms reveals that they
represent the following conceptual categories:
first, more specific news or information about
the company, such as 1=1:11MITtA- (the head of
Chinese IT), ring g-T---ffg/rg (No. I of the
first 100 most powerful electronic companies in
China), Jamaft (Joint venture of Legend
and CA) and *VIZ* (Happy Family, a
software kit); the products of Legend
Corporation, such as kV, (Legend
motherboard), IKEV4 (Legend software),
Vea-P&apos; (Legend Chinese card); the
management of Legend company, such as
Reasa (president of Legend), gal-Vita
(vice-president of Legend); and other related
corporations, such as ±Akt111 (business
corporation), Egttlal (electronic
corporation), IA.X111 (industrial
corporation), and (Haier
Corporation). At this point, the user has another
option. He can go through the selection panel
associated with each retrieved document to see
which document contains the information he
wants. If so, his search iteration will terminate.
If not, he can reformulate his next search by
selecting any one or more terms from the
specific term list. In this particular case, the user
may go for the first choice since the top
document retrieved turns out to be identical for
these two search iterations conducted so far. The
document entitled joiminA-ftVdtorm
AffIVV4A (Reorganization of Legend
Corporation to welcome the joining of WTO)
receives the relevance rate of 100% in both
searches. This is probably the news about
Legend Corporation the user is looking for.
As mentioned above, even if the user has
obtained the information he desires, he still can
reformulate or expand his next search for more
specific news about VS (Legend Corporation).
Also, the user can launch a completely new
search for another company. Remember
WZARti (Haier Corporation), another most
powerful company in China, appears in the
specific term list. By clicking on this term, the
user will be able to locate the latest news or
other information about a new company.

This paper presents an intuitive search system
for casual or novice Chinese users on specific
websites. Instead of describing the algorithmic
portions of each component, we focus on
illustrating the overall system design and how
the integrated system works and serves the end-
users. The presented system provides human
intelligence to the user who desires to seek
relevant information over Internet. It does not
assume that the user receives any training in
search and retrieval or has any prior experience
in using Internet. The user can start his search
with a general and vague term or idea. The
integrated system will guide the user from a
general search to a series of more specific
searches until he is fully satisfied with the
information returned. Our survey states that the
existing search systems, especially those in the
Chinese market, are still dominated by key term
search mechanism. This integrated system
presents a new paradigm. It provides a concept-
driven search environment that allows the user
to manipulate the semantic relationships
between the original query terms with its
associated terms. We have so far built two
applications based on two specific domains. The
preliminary results have demonstrated that the
integration of a concept network, a query
reformulator, a standard search algorithm, an
auto summarizer, and an optional &apos;TTS engine
indeed suits the current information seeking
behavior and make search activities in websites
more intuitive, as well as productive.
