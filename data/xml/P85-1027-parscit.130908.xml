ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999960441860465">
Anaphora resolution is the prooess of
determining the referent of anaphors.
such as definite noun phrases and
pronouns, in a discourse. Computational
linguists, in modeling the process of
anaphora resolution, have proposed the
notion of focusing. Focusing is the
process. engaged in by a reader, of
selecting a subset of the discourse
items and making them highly available
for further computations. This paper
provides a cognitive basis for anaphora
resolution and focusing. Human memory
is divided into a short-term, an
operating, and a long-term memory.
Short-term memory can only contain a
small number of meaning units and its
retrieval time is fast. Short-term
memory is divided into a cache and a
buffer. The cache contains a subset of
meaning units expressed in the previous
sentences and the buffer holds a
representation of the incoming sentence.
Focusing is realized in the cache that
contains a subset of the most topical
units and a subset of the most recent
units in the text. The information
stored in the cache is used to integrate
the incoming sentence with the preceding
discourse. Pronouns should be used to
refer to units in focus. Operating
memory contains a very large number of
units but its retrieval time is slow.
It contains the previous text units that
are not in the cache. It comprises the
text units not in focus. Definite noun
phrases should be used to refer to units
not in focus. Two empirical studies are
described that demonstrate the cognitive
basis for focusing, the use of definite
noun phrases to refer to antecedents not
in focus, and the use of pronouns to
refer to antecedents in focus.

The goal of this research is to

the computational linguistics work based
on the notion of focusing.
This rapprochement is important for
the following reasons:

FOCUSING IN COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999461888888889">
According to Grosz (1977). who was
interested in the resolution of definite
noun phrases. focusing is the process,
engaged in by participants in a
discourse, of highlighting a subset of
their shared reality. Grosz, Joshi. and
Weinstein (1983) distinguish between two
levels of focus, global focus and
centering. Global focusing is a major
factor in maintaining global coherence
and in the interpretation of definite
noun phrases. Centering is a major
factor in maintaining local coherence
and in the interpretation of pronouns.
Grosz. Joshi. and Weinstein further
define the notion of centering. Each
sentence has two types of centers whose
purpose is to integrate the sentence to
the discourse. The backward-looking
center links the current sentence to the
preceding discourse. The set of
forward-looking centers provides this set
of entities to whioh further anaphors
may refer. The backward-looking center
corresponds, roughly.- to Sidner&apos;s focus
and the forward-looking centers to
Sidner&apos;s potential foci.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999918405797102">
One principle derived by Grosz,
Joshi. and Weinstein is the following:
if the backward-looking center of the
current utterance is the same as the
backward-looking center of the previous
utterance, a pronoun should be used. In
other words, if there are no topic
shifts, continue to refer to the same
entity by using a pronoun.
However, violations of this
principle have been presented in Grosz
(1977) and noted in Grosz, Joshi. and
Weinstein (1983). They have shown that
pronouns are sometimes used to refer to
entities mentioned many sentences back,
even though the backward-looking center
of intervening sentences has been
changed by topic shifts.
Sidner (1979. 1983) has proposed
the notion of focus in the context of
interpreting anaphors, especially
pronouns. In Sidner&apos;s theory, an
anaphor neither refers to another word
nor co-refers to another word, but
rather co-specifies a cognitive element
in the reader&apos;s mind. Moreover, a
theory of anaphora resolution must
predict the pattern of reader&apos;s correct
and incorrect choices of co-specifiers
and the failures to understand. This
view makes explicit the consideration of
the reader&apos;s mental model and
inferential capabilities
A sketch of Sidner&apos;s focusing
process follows. First, an initial
focus is selected on the basis of
syntactic features and thematic roles
indicating topicality in the first
sentence. Other elements introduced in
the sentence are stored as potential
foci for later sentences. When an
anaphoric expression is encountered.
this focus is tested as a co-specifier
for the anaphor. It has to satisfy
syntactic restrictions on co-references
(Lasnik, 1976), semantio selectional
restrictions (Eatz and Fodor, 1963), and
pragmatic plausibility constraints
expressed in the remainder of the
sentence. If the foous fails as a
co-specifier for the anaphor, the
potential foci are tried in turn. At
the same time, the new elements
introduced in the sentence are stored as
potential foci for later sentences.
Third, the focus is updated to the
selected co-specifier for the anaphor.
If the focus has changed, a topic shift
has occurred. The second and third
steps are cyclically applied after each
sentence.
The advantage of using a focus
mechanism is that it prioritizes and
restricts the search for a co-specifier,
and as a consequence, reduces the
computational costs associated with
inferential processing when testing the
applicability of the co-specifier to the
anaphor.

, COGNITIVE STUDIES OF ANAPHORA RESOLUTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9611808">
A few representative empirical
studies of anaphora resolution are
described below. All the experimental
paradigms used share the following
assumptions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8917052">
1) human memory is functionally or
structurally divided into at least two
types of memories, a short-term memory
with small storage capacity but very
fast retrieval time and a long-term
memory with very large storage capacity
but slow retrieval time;
2) a topic shift transfers the units
currently in short-term memory to
long-term memory;
3) an anaphor transfers its referent
from long-term memory to short-term
memory (i.e. reinstates its referent),
if it was not already in short-term
memory.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968820512821">
The first assumption is crucial.
Other things being equal, computations
involving retrieval from short-term
memory will be faster than those
involving retrieval from long-term
memory. Turning to the second
assumption. topic shifts have been found
to be induced with a varity of
linguistic devices. One of the devices
is the introduction of intervening
sentences between the referent and its
anaphor. The intervening sentences are
unrelated to the referent but related to
the overall text. Another device is the
specification of a temporal or spatial
parameter that is outside the normal
range of a situation. When describing a
dinner, the phrase &amp;quot;Five hours later,&amp;quot;
signals that the topic of conversation
is no longer the dinner. Another device
is the use of an anaphor. frequently a
definite noun phrase. to refer to an
antecedent that is not currently the
topic of conversation but is in the
&amp;quot;background&amp;quot;. Finally, there is the use
of key phrases to signal a diversion in
the flow of discourse, such as &amp;quot;Let&apos;s
turn to.&amp;quot;. as documented in Reichman
(1978. 1984).
The general pattern for the
material used in these experiments is
the following. At the beginning of the
text appears a sentence containing a
referent (e.g. biologist). For
example, &amp;quot;The mission included a
biologist&amp;quot;. Then. if the referent
should not be in focus, the next
sentence or sentences indicate a topic
shift as described above (e.g.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998242">
219
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999844303846155">
unrelated intervening sentences). If
the referent should be in focus, no
devices for topic shifts are used. The
following sentence then contains an
anaphor (e.g. scientist, he) to the
focused or non-focused referent (e.g.
biologist). For example, &amp;quot;The scientist
collected samples from the cultures&amp;quot;.
Another example is shown in Table 1 of
this paper.
Carpenter and Just (1977) used eye
tracking with other converging
techniques to study anaphora resolution.
With eye tracking, one can monitor very
precisely the trajectory of the eyes,
with their forward and regressive
movements, and the duration of eye
fixations on small segments of the text.
The assumption behind using this
technique is that eye movements are
closely related to higher level
cognitive activities such as
comprehension. Therefore, one can
expect longer fixation durations on text
segments requiring additional processing
to be comprehended and one can expect
the eye movement pattern to mirror the
selective pickup of important
information in the text.
They performed a series of
experiments testing the effect of
recency of a referent on the time course
of anaphora resolution. Indirectly.
they tested the effect of recency on the
availability of an item in short-term
memory. They presented texts where the
number of sentences between the referent
and the anaphor was varied from zero to
three. The subjects read each sentence
and, after the sentence, had to decide
whether it was consistent Or
inconsistent with the previous
sentences. The consistency judgment
times and the eye fixations were
recorded. The consistency judgment
task, used as converging evidence with
the eye movement technique, is believed
to induce the subjects to integrate each
new sentence and should parallel the
difficulty of anaphora resolution. The
overall reading time of the anaphorio
sentence was measured using the eye
tracking technique. Each of these tasks
should be faster if the referent was in
short-term memory than if the referent
was in long-term memory.
Response times for the consistency
judgments and reading times of the
anaphoric sentences increased as the
number of intervening sentences
increased. The sharpest difference
appeared between zero and one
intervening sentence. Gaze durations
within the anaphoric sentence were
shorter when there were no intervening
sentences than in the other conditions.
These results show not only that
anaphora resolution is easier when the
referent is nearer the anaphor but also
that one intervening sentence may be
sufficient to produce a topic shift.
Clark and Sengul (1979) used the
sentence reading time technique to study
anaphora resolution. In this technique.
subjects control the onset and offset of
the presentation of a sentence by
pressing a button. The subjects are
instructed to press the button to see a
new sentence as soon as they have
understood the current sentence. The
assumption behind this technique is that
additional processing required for
comprehension will increase sentence
reading time.
Clark and Sengul (1979) measured
the reading time of a sentence
containing an anaphor. They
distinguished between two models of the
effect of recency of a referent on the
speed of anaphora resolution. In the
first model, called the &amp;quot;continuity
model&amp;quot;, entities mentioned in the
discourse are searched backward from the
last one. One should expect
monotonically increasing reading time as
the searched entity is farther back. In
the second model, called the
&amp;quot;discontinuity model&amp;quot;, entities
mentioned in the current or last
sentence are kept in short-term memory
and accessed first. All the entities
that are further back are more likely to
be in long-term memory (and not in
short-term memory) and accessed second.
Subjects read short paragraphs
where a referent could be separated from
the anaphor by zero to two intervening
sentences. The reading time of the
sentence containing the anaphor was fast
when the referent was in the immediately
preceding sentence but all Slow when
it was two or three sentences before.
This finding supports the discontinuity
model. Entities in the last processing
cycle are more likely to be kept in
short-term memory than entities in
previously processed cycles. Once a
text entity is not in short-term, the
number of intervening sentences does not
affect the speed of anaphora resolution.
Lesgold, Roth, and Curtis (1979),
who related the linguistic notion of
foregrounding (Chafe. 1972) to the
psychological notion of short-term
memory, performed a series of
experiments similar to those of Clark
and Sengul (1979). using more varied
ways to produce topic shifts, and
replicated the above findings.
MoKoon and Ratoliff (1980) used an
activation prooedure based on Chang
(1980). A desoription of the basic
paradigm and its underlying logic
follows. When one reads a text, only a
small part of the text information is
stored in short-term memory and most of
the information is stored in long-term
memory. This is due to the very small
storage capacity of short-term memory (7
t2 chunks- Miller, 1956). Given that
retrieval time in short-term memory is
much faster than retrieval time in
long-term memory, it will take longer to
remember something from the text if the
memory is stored in long-term memory
than in short-term memory.
In their study, subjects read a
paragraph sentence by sentenoe.
Immediately after the last sentence, the
subjects were presented with a single
word and the subjects had to remember
whether the word had appeared previously
in the text or not (an old-new
recognition). If the tested word was
still in short-term memory, the old-new
recognition time should be faster than
if it was in long-term memory.
To test this hypothesis. the
paragraphs were constructed in the
following manner. The referent (e.g.
burglar) was separated from the anaphor
by either zero or two intervening
sentences. The anaphor appeared in the
last sentence of the paragraph. The
last sentence was presented in one of
three versions: 1) the subject of the
sentence was a repetition (i.e.
burglar) of the referent in the first
sentence (anaphoric-identical); 2) the
subject was the name of the category&apos;
(e.g. criminal) in which the referent
belonged (anaphoric- category); 3) the
subject was a noun (e.g. cat) unrelated
to the referent (non-anaphoric). During
the experimental trials, the &amp;quot;referent&amp;quot;
(i.e. burglar) was presented
immediately after the last sentence for
an old-new recognition.
Assuming that an anaphor activates
its referent by making it available in
short-term memory, one can expect
significantly faster old-new recognition
times for &amp;quot;burglar&amp;quot; in the
anaphoric-category condition than in the
non-anaphoric condition. This
prediction was observed.
Surprisingly, the number of
intervening sentenoes did not have an
effect. This suggests that the two
intervening sentences did not remove the
referent from short-term memory (i.e.
&amp;quot;backgrounds&amp;quot; the referent). It is
probably not the case. Rather, it is
likely that by testing the referent at
the end of the clause, as opposed to
when the anaphor is encountered, the
referent had time to be reinstated in
short-term memory and be highly
available. This is an important point.
The activation procedure was not on-line
since the old-new recognition occured at
the end of the sentence as opposed to
while the sentence was read and the
anaphor encountered.
Another initially surprising effect
was that the old-new recognition times
for the referents were slower in the
zero intervening sentences when the
anaphor was a repetition of the referent
itself than when the anaphor was the
category name. This last result
suggests that it is not appropriate to
use a definite noun phrase, especially a
repetition of the referent, to refer to
a antecedent in short-term memory.
As explained previously.
intervening sentences are not the only
devices that transfer text units from
short-term to long-term memory.
Stereotypical situations have spatial
and temporal parameters with legal
ranges of values. If one specifies a
spatial or temporal value outside these
ranges, a scenario-shift occurs. For
example. Anderson (in Sanford and
Garrod, 1981) constructed texts about
stereotypical situations such as going
to a restaurant. In one sentence of the
text, there was a reference to a
character related to the script, say a
waiter. At the beginning of the next
sentence, there was a mention of a
temporal or spatial parameter, such as
&amp;quot;One hour later&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Five hours later&amp;quot;.
In the first case the parameter is
within the range defining the script, in
the second case it is not. The rest of
the sentence contained an anaphor to the
previously mentioned character, the
waiter. Measuring the reading time of
the anaphoric sentence. Anderson showed
longer reading time when the spatial or
temporal parameter was outside the range
of the script than inside. This
suggests that the referent was
transfered from short-term to long-term
memory by the scenario-shift and it took
longer to retrieve the referent during
anaphora resolution.
The results from all these
experiments support the notion that an
anaphor activates its referent by making
it highly available in short-term memory
and that topic shifts transfer units
from short-term memory to long-term
memory. However, none of these studies.

COGNITIVE BASIS FOR FOCUSING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99921655319149">
A sketch of a cognitive model of
anaphora resolution is offered here. It
has been heavily influenced by the
short-term/long-term memory model of
Kintsch and van Dijk (1978) and
especially its leading edge strategy.
Structure mf human memory
Analogically, human memory can be
conceptualized as a three level
structure similar to the memory of most
mini and main frame computers. It
consists of a small, very fast memory
called short-term memory (STM); a
relatively larger main or operating
memory (OM): and a vast store of
general world knowledge called long-term
memory (LTM).
The total STM is only large enough
to contain 7t2 chunks of information at
any one time (Simon. 1974; Miller,
1956). The resources for STM are
dynamically allocated to one of two
uses. First, part of the STM is used to
store the incoming sentence or clause.
This is a temporary storage of the
sentence or clause before further
processing and is called the STM buffer.
The second part of STM is called the STM
cache. It Is used to hold over, from
one sentence or clause to the next, the
information necessary to provide local
and global coherence. It contains a
subset of the previous text items that
are topical and a subset of those that
are recent. Retrieval times from
short-term memory are very fast.
Conceptually, operating memory is
the subset of the world knowledge in
long-term memory which is deemed
relevant to the processing of the
current part of the text. It also
contains the growing memory structure
corresponding to the text read so far.
It contains the less topical and less
recent information from the text.
Retrieval times are much longer than for
short-term memory.

The time course of anaphora
resolution is greatly determined by the
current content of short-term memory and
of operating memory. Moroever, pronouns
and definite noun phrases are resolved
using different strategies.
Cache management. During the input
of a sentence into the buffer and the
concurrent integration of the sentence
into the oache, a subset of the semantic
units held in the STM is selected to be
held over in the cache for the next
cycle. Following Kintsch and van Dijk
(1978), the cache management strategy
selects a subset T of the most topical
items and a subset R of the most recent
items to be held over in the cache. The
selection strategy aims at maximizing
the probability that an anaphor in the
next sentence will refer to a semantic
unit held in the cache. Cache
management is applied after each
sentence or clause.
Anaphora rosmlntimm - Integmatimm.
Pronouns and definite noun phrases are
resolved using different strategies. We
will describe four cases:
1. The anaphor is a definite noun
phrase and the referent is not
in focus, that is. it is in
operating memory.
2. The anaphor is a definite noun
phrase and the referent is in
focus, that is, it is in the
cache.
3. The anaphor is a pronoun and
the referent is in the cache
(in focus).
4. The anaphor is a pronoun and
the referent is in operating
memory (not in focus).
It is hypothesized that the
explicitness of an anaphor is a signal.
used by the reader, which denotes
whether the referent is in the cache or
in operating memory.
If the anaphor is a definite noun
phrase, operating memory is searched
immediately. If the referent is in
operating memory it is then reinstated
into the cache. A topic shift has
occured.
If the anaphor is a definite noun
phrase and the referent is in focus
(i.e. in the cache). anaphora
resolution will be hindered. The reader
searches operating memory while the
referent is in short-term memory.
Correspondingly, this violates a rule of
cooperative communication: use a
definite noun phrase to refer to an
antecedent not in focus. The definite
noun phrase signals a topic shift. while
in fact, the same entity is being talked
about.
If the anaphor is a pronoun, the
cache is searched for a plausible
referent. If found. anaphora resolution
is completed. Beoause cache management
is based on topicality and recency,
pronouns can refer to the main topic of
the text even when the main topic has
not been mentioned directly for many
sentences. Unless there is a global
topic shift, the main topic in the cache
remains unchanged throughout the text.
If the anaphor is a pronoun but no
referent is found in the cache, it is
then necessary to search operating
memory. If a referent is found in
operating memory. it is reinstated into
the cache. A topic shift has occured.
Using a pronoun to refer to information
in operating memory is detrimental to
anaphora resolution. The reader first
searches the cache, then the operating
memory, and then has to reinstate the
referent into the cache.

COMPARISONS

A clear relation exists between the
notion of focusing proposed in
computational linguistics and the model
of human memory and discourse processing
proposed in cognitive psychology.
The cacte is used to store the
items in LQ2115. Given the small number
of items stored in the cache, a sketchy
anaphor such as a =mums is sufficient
to retrieve the referent. The cache
management strategy in human .memory is
aimed at maximizing the probability that
the cache contains the information
relevant to the next cycle of
computation. The cache, by containing
topical and recent items, allows to
maintain global and local coherence.
Operatizg memorv is used to store
items that are not in :0042. Because
the set of items is large, an
informative description of the item to
be searched for is needed. Della:lite
=as 2Uxasse are used to indicate to the
reader that the item is not in focus,
thus in operating memory. Other things
being equal, it will take more time to
retrieve an item from operating memory
than from the cache. The referent will
need to be reinstated into the cache.
This will produce a topic shift. The
reinstated referent is then highly
available and can be referred to by
using a pronoun.

TWO ON-LINE STUDIES OF ANAPHORA
RESOLUTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999871532258065">
The presented studies test the
notion that focus is cognitively
realized in the reader&apos;s limited
short-term memory. They also test
Grosz. Joshi, and Weinstein&apos;s claim that
definite noun phrases, and not pronouns,
should be used to refer to items no
longer in focus and that pronouns, and
not definite noun phrases, should be
used to refer to items in focus.
Moreover, if one assumes that the
content of short-term memory is
dynamically updated on the basis of
recency and topicality, one can explain
why pronouns can be used to refer to
recent items and also to topical
non-reoent items.
A new technique, called one
actlYati2n, was developed specifically
to provide the empirical data for these
studies. The on-line activation
technique can be compared to &amp;quot;closely&amp;quot;
tracing the execution of a program.
In the on-line activation
technique. passages are presented using
rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP),
one word at a time. In addition to
reading each text, the participants were
also given the task to recognize whether
some specially marked words, presented
surreptitiously within the text, had
appeared before in the text or not.
Some of these special words were
presented before in the text and others
were not.. We will call these specially
marked words test words. This task is
called an old-new recognition task.
The passages contained anaphors
referring to antecedents which were
either in focus or not in focus. An
antecedent was removed from focus by
introducing a topic shift, with the
restriction that the antecedent was not
the main topic of the discourse. An
example text is presented in table 1.
Note that only one of the alternative
sentences 5a, 513. or 5c was presented
for each text to the participants of the
study.
In each text, one of the test words
was the referent of the anaphor. At
some point before or after the anaphor
was presented on the CRT. its referent
was presented for old-new recognition
and recognition times and errors were
collected. The delay between the onset
of the anaphor and the onset of the test
word is called the stimulus onset
asynohrony (SOA). The anaphor is acting
as a prime, which should activate the
referent. The old-new recognition time
for the referent test word indicates

the expected reading.
5b- A broken instrument was not giving
the expected reading.
Sc- The computer terminal was not giving
the expected reading.
In addition, there were three types
of primes, as shown in sentences 5a, 5b,
and 5o in Table 1. The prime could be
either semantically related and
referential (S+R+) as in 5a,
semantically related and not referential
(S+R-) as in 5b, or semantically
unrelated and not referential (S-R-) as
in Sc. In the S+R+ condition, the prime
is the anaphor. The two conditions S+R-
and S-R- were control conditions to
separate the effect of semantic priming,
due to semantic association between the
anaphor and the referent, on the old-new
recognition for referents.
A schema of the procedure is shown
in Table 2. The words surrounded by
stars are the test words.

terms of the experimental
conditions, there should be a

2 The use of a definite noun

antecedent in the cache (i.e.

Method
participants There were 36
participants in this study.
Materials- There were 36
experimental texts. They contained as a
referent an instance of a class (e.g.
thermometer) to be used later as a test
word, and as an anaphor the class name
(e.g. instrument). In this study, the
anaphor was a definite noun phrase. An

the left, for new test words. The texts
were presented using RSVP. with each
word presented in the center of the
screen for 300 msec. The participants
were asked to recognize whether the test
words were old or new, as fast as
possible but without making mistakes.
Design There were 36 experimental
texts and 18 experimental conditions.
The first manipulation was the focusing
of the referent: in focus or not in
focus. The second manipulation was the
SOA: immediately before the prime, 350
msec after, 1250 msec after. The third
manipulation was priming: S+R+. S+R-,
S-R-. The design was completely
within-subject, with two texts randomly
assigned to each experimental condition
using two randomly sampled 18 by 18
Latin Squares. Each participant was
randomly assigned to a row of the Latin
Squares.

In another study (Guindon. 1982),
using the same on-line activation
technique, the activation of an
antecedent by a pronoun was traced. In
this study, it was found that referring
to an antecedent not in focus by using a
pronoun was detrimental to anaphora
resolution. The delay between reading
the anaphor and reinstating the
antecedent was as long as 2400 msec.
The activation of an antecedent not in
focus by a pronoun takes a long time
because the reader is induced: 1) to
search the cache unsuccesfully: 2) to
search operating memory with a &amp;quot;sketchy&amp;quot;
pronoun: 3) to reinstate the referent
into the cache. Activation was
immediate for the antecedents in focus.
As opposed to the previous study where
referring to a focused referent using a
definite noun phrase hindered anaphora
resolution, no such effect was observed
when using a pronoun. This is expected
since pronouns signal that the referent
is in the cache.

SUMMARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999852926829268">
The notion of focusing and the
notion that the form of the anaphor
signals whether the referent is in focus
or not have cognitive support. Items in
focus are items in the cache which is
dynamically updated to contain the T
most topical and the R most recent items
in the text. Because the cache contains
few items, pronouns should be used to
refer to items in focus. Other things
being equal. anaphora resolution will be
easier if the antecedent is in focus,
because the retrieval times from the
cache are much faster than those from
the operating memory. Antecedents not
in focus are in operating memory. Items
not in focus are in operating memory. A
definite noun phrase, because it is more
descriptive than a pronoun, should be
used to retrieve the antecedent from the
large set of items in operating memory.
However, because the retrieval time is
slow in operating memory, anaphora
resolution is more difficult for items
that are not in focus. The
reinstatement of an antecedent into the
cache effects a topic shift.
The on-line activation technique
was developed specifically to provide
empirical data on the notion of focus.
The advantage of this technique over
conventional memory experiments is that
one can test precisely the temporal
properties of various analyses and
processes occurring during sentence and
text comprehension. This technique can
be used to distinguish between different
models of anaphora resolution when these
models are not easily distinguished on
the basis of discourse or dialogue
analysis.

<abstract confidence="0.998798772727273">Anaphora resolution is the prooess of determining the referent of anaphors. noun phrases and pronouns, in a discourse. Computational linguists, in modeling the process of anaphora resolution, have proposed the notion of focusing. Focusing is the process. engaged in by a reader, of selecting a subset of the discourse items and making them highly available for further computations. This paper provides a cognitive basis for anaphora resolution and focusing. Human memory is divided into a short-term, an operating, and a long-term memory. Short-term memory can only contain a number of meaning units and is fast. Short-term memory is divided into a cache and a buffer. The cache contains a subset of meaning units expressed in the previous sentences and the buffer holds a of the sentence. Focusing is realized in the cache that contains a subset of the most topical units and a subset of the most recent units in the text. The information stored in the cache is used to integrate the incoming sentence with the preceding discourse. Pronouns should be used to refer to units in focus. Operating memory contains a very large number of units but its retrieval time is slow. It contains the previous text units that are not in the cache. It comprises the text units not in focus. Definite noun phrases should be used to refer to units not in focus. Two empirical studies are described that demonstrate the cognitive focusing, the use of definite noun phrases to refer to antecedents not in focus, and the use of pronouns to refer to antecedents in focus.</abstract>

The assumption behind using this technique is that eye movements are closely related to higher level cognitive activities such as comprehension.

Once a text entity is not in short-term, the number of intervening sentences does not affect the speed of anaphora resolution. Lesgold, Roth, and Curtis (1979), who related the linguistic notion of foregrounding (Chafe. 1972) to the psychological notion of short-term memory, performed a series of experiments similar to those of Clark and Sengul (1979). using more varied ways to produce topic shifts, and replicated the above findings. MoKoon and Ratoliff (1980) used an activation prooedure based on Chang (1980). A desoription of the basic paradigm and its underlying logic follows. When one reads a text, only a small part of the text information is stored in short-term memory and most of the information is stored in long-term memory. This is due to the very small storage capacity of short-term memory (7 t2 chunks- Miller, 1956). Given that retrieval time in short-term memory is much faster than retrieval time in long-term memory, it will take longer to remember something from the text if the memory is stored in long-term memory than in short-term memory.

MoKoon and Ratoliff (1980) used an activation prooedure based on Chang (1980). A desoription of the basic paradigm and its underlying logic follows. When one reads a text, only a small part of the text information is stored in short-term memory and most of the information is stored in long-term memory. This is due to the very small storage capacity of short-term memory (7 t2 chunks- Miller, 1956). Given that retrieval time in short-term memory is much faster than retrieval time in long-term memory, it will take longer to remember something from the text if the memory is stored in long-term memory than in short-term memory. In their study, subjects read a paragraph sentence by sentenoe. Immediately after the last sentence, the subjects were presented with a single word and the subjects had to remember whether the word had appeared previously in the text or not (an old-new recognition). If the tested word was still in short-term memory, the old-new recognition time should be faster than</context>

Structure mf human memory Analogically, human memory can be conceptualized as a three level structure similar to the memory of most mini and main frame computers. It consists of a small, very fast memory called short-term memory (STM); a relatively larger main or operating memory (OM): and a vast store of general world knowledge called long-term memory (LTM). The total STM is only large enough to contain 7t2 chunks of information at any one time (Simon. 1974; Miller, 1956). The resources for STM are dynamically allocated to one of two uses. First, part of the STM is used to store the incoming sentence or clause. This is a temporary storage of the sentence or clause before further processing and is called the STM buffer. The second part of STM is called the STM cache. It Is used to hold over, from one sentence or clause to the next, the information necessary to provide local and global coherence. It contains a subset of the previous text items that are topical and a subset of those that are recent. Retrieval times from short-term memory are very fast. Conceptual</context>
