This paper attempts to explore the interrelation
between philosophical accounts of language
and respective technological developments in
the field of human language technologies. In
doing so, it focuses on the interaction between
analytical philosophy and machine translation
development, trying to draw the emerging
methodological analogies.

<bodyText confidence="0.99942196969697">
Philosophical accounts of science and respective
technological development bear a tight interrela-
tion and continuous interplay. Likewise, philo-
sophical investigations of language bear their
own implications on how technology processing
language, in monolingual or multilingual set-
tings, evolves.
In the multilingual setting, machine translation
feasibility, its presuppositions and implications,
brings forth a range of questions, applicable to
human translation as well, including, but not lim-
ited to, linguistic and ontological relativity, inde-
terminacy of translation, inscrutability of refer-
ence, representational function of language, the
problem of meaning.
Bar Hillel’s claims on the infeasibility of ma-
chine translation and the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
with the linguistic determinism and relativity
principles, partly backed up by Quine’s ontologi-
cal relativity and later Wittgenstein’s private lan-
guage and variability of language games have
haunted the way of thinking in machine transla-
tion development. Indeterminacy, relativity, and
the consequent abolition of the one gold transla-
tion idea, however, as well as the necessity for
frameworks integrating pragmatic and be-
havioural data in translation have played their
role in advancing machine translation design
paving the way for observed paradigm shifts at
all stages of development.
In broadly dividing machine translation history
in the rule-based and corpus-based eras, in the
50’s and 80’s respectively, one can draw the
analogies that would rather point to a tight inter-
action between philosophical accounts and ma-
chine translation paradigms.
Early contemporary analytic philosophy, through
conceptual, reference-bound analysis and com-
positionality principles, provided the foundation
for representational, rule and knowledge-based
approaches of early machine translation, from
50’s through the 80’s. The turn, in analytic phi-
losophy, to an understanding of meaning though
use, to pragmatics and behaviourism, may be
paired and seen as laying the foundation for the
machine translation paradigm shift observed in
the 80’s. In this pairing, it is the use of the much
required parallel (or comparable) translation data
that could be seen as constituting the behavioural
data base, with each alignment function being
conceived of as the result of a radical translation
process, where a source language sentence pro-
vides the sensory data and a target language sen-
tence provides the linguistic observation. In such
a framework, this aligned data source does pro-
vide the “translation manual”, which after a se-
ries of inductive operations does converge to a
potentially usable set of translation relations.
Along this line, we will discuss, in this talk, the
continuous relations between analytic philoso-
phy, linguistic science and human language tech-
nologies. Such relations, direct or indirect, can be
bi-directional and can possibly work towards bet-
ter understanding and facilitating the virtuous cy-
cle between language technology and its theoreti-
cal underpinnings.
