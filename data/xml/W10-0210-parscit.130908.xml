Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.997241727272727">
The automatic analysis and classification of
text using fine-grained attitude labels is the
main task we address in our research. The de-
veloped @AM system relies on compositio-
nality principle and a novel approach based on
the rules elaborated for semantically distinct
verb classes. The evaluation of our method on
1000 sentences, that describe personal expe-
riences, showed promising results: average
accuracy on fine-grained level was 62%, on
middle level – 71%, and on top level – 88%.

<bodyText confidence="0.999137529411765">
With rapidly growing online sources aimed at en-
couraging and stimulating people’s discussions
concerning personal, public or social issues (news,
blogs, discussion forums, etc.), there is a great
need in development of a computational tool for
the analysis of people’s attitudes. According to the
Appraisal Theory (Martin and White, 2005), atti-
tude types define the specifics of appraisal being
expressed: affect (personal emotional state), judg-
ment (social or ethical appraisal of other’s behav-
iour), and appreciation (evaluation of phenomena).
To analyse contextual sentiment (polarity) of a
phrase or a sentence, rule-based approaches (Na-
sukawa and Yi, 2003; Mulder et al., 2004; Moila-
nen and Pulman, 2007; Subrahmanian and
Reforgiato, 2008), a machine-learning method us-
ing not only lexical but also syntactic features

(Wilson et al., 2005), and a model of integration of
machine learning approach with compositional
semantics (Choi and Cardie, 2008) were proposed.
With the aim to recognize fine-grained emotions
from text on the level of distinct sentences, re-
searchers have employed a keyword spotting tech-
nique (Olveres et al., 1998; Chuang and Wu, 2004;
Strapparava et al., 2007), a technique calculating
emotion scores using Pointwise Mutual Informa-
tion (PMI) (Kozareva et al., 2007), an approach
inspired by common-sense knowledge (Liu et al.,
2003), rule-based linguistic approaches (Boucou-
valas, 2003; Chaumartin, 2007), machine-learning
methods (Alm, 2008; Aman and Szpakowicz,
2008; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008), and an
ensemble based multi-label classification technique
(Bhowmick et al., 2009).
Early attempts to focus on distinct attitude types
in the task of attitude analysis were made by Ta-
boada and Grieve (2004), who determined a poten-
tial value of adjectives for affect, judgement and
appreciation by calculating the PMI with the pro-
noun-copular pairs ‘I was (affect)’, ‘He was
(judgement)’, and ‘It was (appreciation)’, and
Whitelaw et al. (2005), who used machine learning
technique (SVM) with fine-grained semantic dis-
tinctions in features (attitude type, orientation) in
combination with “bag of words” to classify movie
reviews. However, the concentration only on ad-
jectives, that express appraisal, and their modifiers,
greatly narrows the potential of the Whitelaw et
al.’s (2005) approach.

labels (nine affect categories (Izard, 1971): ‘anger’,
‘disgust’, ‘fear’, ‘guilt’, ‘interest’, ‘joy’, ‘sadness’,
‘shame’, ‘surprise’; four polarity labels for judg-
ment and appreciation: ‘POS jud’, ‘NEG jud’,
‘POS app’, ‘NEG app’; and ‘neutral’); (2) assigns
the strength of the attitude; and (3) determines the
level of confidence, with which the attitude is ex-
pressed. @AM relies on compositionality principle

2 Lexicon for Attitide Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.946313333333333">
We built the lexicon for attitude analysis that in-
cludes: (1) attitude-conveying terms; (2) modifiers;
(3) “functional” words; and (4) modal operators.

2.1 The Core of Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999722842105263">
As a core of lexicon for attitude analysis, we em-
ploy Affect database and extended version of Sen-
tiFul database developed by Neviarouskaya et al.
(2009). The affective features of each emotion-
related word are encoded using nine emotion labels
(‘anger’, ‘disgust’, ‘fear’, ‘guilt’, ‘interest’, ‘joy’,
‘sadness’, ‘shame’, and ‘surprise’) and correspond-
ing emotion intensities that range from 0.0 to 1.0.
The original version of SentiFul database, which
contains sentiment-conveying adjectives, adverbs,
nouns, and verbs annotated by sentiment polarity,
polarity scores and weights, was manually ex-
tended using attitude labels. Some examples of
annotated attitude-conveying words are listed in
Table 1. It is important to note here that some
words could express different attitude types (affect,
judgment, appreciation) depending on context;
such lexical entries were annotated by all possible
categories.

2.2 Modifiers and Functional Words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984275">
The robust attitude analysis method should rely not
only on attitude-conveying terms, but also on mod-
ifiers and contextual valence shifters (term intro-
duced by Polanyi and Zaenen (2004)), which are
integral parts of our lexicon.
We collected 138 modifiers that have an impact
on contextual attitude features of related words,
phrases, or clauses. They include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988308461538462">
1. Adverbs of degree (e.g., ‘significantly’,
‘slightly’ etc.) and adverbs of affirmation (e.g.,
‘absolutely’, ‘seemingly’) that have an influence on
the strength of attitude of the related words.
2. Negation words (e.g., ‘never’, ‘nothing’
etc.) that reverse the polarity of related statement.
3. Adverbs of doubt (e.g., ‘scarcely’, ‘hardly’
etc.) and adverbs of falseness (e.g., ‘wrongly’ etc.)
that reverse the polarity of related statement.
4. Prepositions (e.g., ‘without’, ‘despite’ etc.)
that neutralize the attitude of related words.
5. Condition operators (e.g., ‘if’, ‘even though’
etc.) that neutralize the attitude of related words.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.955546888888889">
Adverbs of degree and adverbs of affirmation af-
fect on related verbs, adjectives, or another adverb.
Two annotators gave coefficients for intensity de-
gree strengthening or weakening (from 0.0 to 2.0)
to each of 112 collected adverbs, and the result was
averaged (e.g., coeff(‘perfectly’) = 1.9,
coeff(‘slightly’) = 0.2).
We distinguish two types of “functional” words
that influence contextual attitude and its strength:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.983272125">
1. Intensifying adjectives (e.g., ‘rising’, ‘rap-
idly-growing’), nouns (e.g., ‘increase’, ‘up-tick’),
and verbs (e.g., ‘to grow’, ‘to rocket’), which in-
crease the strength of attitude of related words.
2. Reversing adjectives (e.g., ‘reduced’), nouns
(e.g., ‘termination’, ‘reduction’), and verbs (e.g.,
‘to decrease’, ‘to limit’, ‘to diminish’), which re-
verse the prior polarity of related words.

2.3 Modal Operators

<bodyText confidence="0.999855625">
Consideration of the modal operators in the tasks
of opinion mining and attitude analysis is very im-
portant, as they indicate a degree of person’s belief
in the truth of the proposition, which is subjective
in nature. Modal expressions point to likelihood
and clearly involve the speaker’s judgment (Hoye,
1997). Modals are distinguished by the confidence
level.

3 Compositionality Principle
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999582395061729">
Words in a sentence are interrelated and, hence,
each of them can influence the overall meaning
and attitudinal bias of a statement. The algorithm
for the attitude classification is designed based on
the compositionality principle, according to which
we determine the attitudinal meaning of a sentence
by composing the pieces that correspond to lexical
units or other linguistic constituent types governed
by the rules of polarity reversal, aggregation (fu-
sion), propagation, domination, neutralization, and
intensification, at various grammatical levels.
Polarity reversal means that phrase or statement
containing attitude-conveying term/phrase with
prior positive polarity becomes negative, and vice
versa. The rule of polarity reversal is applied in
three cases: (1) negation word-modifier in relation
with attitude-conveying statement (e.g., ‘never’ &amp;
POS(‘succeed’) =&gt; NEG(‘never succeed’)); (2)
adverb of doubt in relation with attitude-conveying
statement (e.g., ‘scarcely’ &amp; POS(‘relax’) =&gt;
NEG(‘scarcely relax’)); (3) functional word of
reversing type in relation with attitude-conveying
statement (e.g., adjective ‘reduced’ &amp;
POS(‘enthusiasm’) =&gt; NEG(‘reduced enthusi-
asm’)). In the case of judgment and appreciation,
the use of polarity reversal rule is straightforward
(‘POS jud’ &lt;=&gt; ‘NEG jud’, ‘POS app’ &lt;=&gt; ’NEG
app’). However, it is not trivial to find pairs of op-
posite emotions in the case of a fine-grained classi-
fication, except for ‘joy’ and ‘sadness’. Therefore,
we assume that (1) opposite emotion for three posi-
tive emotions, such as ‘interest’, ‘joy’, and ‘sur-
prise’, is ‘sadness’ (‘POS aff’ =&gt; ‘sadness’); and
(2) opposite emotion for six negative emotions,
such as ‘anger’, ‘disgust’, ‘fear’, ‘guilt’, ‘sadness’,
and ‘shame’, is ‘joy’ (‘NEG aff’ =&gt; ‘joy’).
The rules of aggregation (fusion) are as follows:
(1) if polarities of attitude-conveying terms in ad-
jective-noun, noun-noun, adverb-adjective, adverb-
verb phrases have opposite directions, mixed po-
larity with dominant polarity of a descriptive term
is assigned to the phrase (e.g., POS(‘beautiful’) &amp;
NEG(‘fight’) =&gt; POS-neg(‘beautiful fight’);
NEG(‘shamelessly’) &amp; POS(‘celebrate’) =&gt; NEG-
pos(‘shamelessly celebrate’)); otherwise (2) the
resulting polarity is based on the equal polarities of
terms, and the strength of attitude is measured as a
maximum between polarity scores (intensities) of
terms (max(score1,score2)).
The rule of propagation is useful, as proposed in
(Nasukawa and Yi, 2003), for the task of detection
of local sentiments for given subjects. “Propaga-
tion” verbs propagate the sentiment towards the
arguments; “transfer” verbs transmit sentiments
among the arguments. The rule of propagation is
applied when verb of “propagation” or “transfer”
type is used in a phrase/clause and sentiment of an
argument that has prior neutral polarity needs to be
investigated (e.g., PROP-POS(‘to admire’) &amp; ‘his
behaviour’ =&gt; POS(‘his behaviour’); ‘Mr. X’ &amp;
TRANS(‘supports’) &amp; NEG(‘crime business’) =&gt;
NEG(‘Mr. X’)).
The rules of domination are as follows: (1) if po-
larities of verb (this rule is applied only for certain
classes of verbs) and object in a clause have oppo-
site directions, the polarity of verb is prevailing
(e.g., NEG(‘to deceive’) &amp; POS(‘hopes’) =&gt;
NEG(‘to deceive hopes’)); (2) if compound sen-
tence joints clauses using coordinate connector
‘but’, the attitude features of a clause following
after the connector are dominant (e.g., ‘NEG(It
was hard to climb a mountain all night long), but
POS(a magnificent view rewarded the traveler at
the morning).’ =&gt; POS(whole sentence)).
The rule of neutralization is applied when
preposition-modifier or condition operator relate to
the attitude-conveying statement (e.g., ‘despite’ &amp;
NEG(‘worries’) =&gt; NEUT(‘despite worries’)).
The rule of intensification means strengthening
or weakening of the polarity score (intensity), and
is applied when:

<listItem confidence="0.993548833333333">
1. adverb of degree or affirmation relates to at-
titude-conveying term (e.g., Pos_score(‘extremely
happy’) &gt; Pos_score(‘happy’));
2. adjective or adverb is used in a comparative
or superlative form (e.g., Neg_score(‘sad’) &lt;
Neg_score(‘sadder’) &lt; Neg_score (‘saddest’)).

Our method is capable of processing sentences of
different complexity, including simple, compound,
complex (with complement and relative clauses),
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992311">

<bodyText confidence="0.99997658974359">
and complex-compound sentences. To understand
how words and concepts relate to each other in a
sentence, we employ Connexor Machinese Syntax
parser (http://www.connexor.eu/) that
returns lemmas, parts of speech, dependency func-
tions, syntactic function tags, and morphological
tags. When handling the parser output, we repre-
sent the sentence as a set of primitive clauses. Each
clause might include Subject formation, Verb for-
mation and Object formation, each of which may
consist of a main element (subject, verb, or object)
and its attributives and complements. For the
processing of complex or compound sentences, we
build a so-called “relation matrix”, which contains
information about dependences (e.g., coordination,
subordination, condition, contingency, etc.) be-
tween different clauses in a sentence.
The annotations of words are taken from our at-
titude-conveying lexicon. The decision on most
appropriate label, in case of words with multiple
annotations (e.g., word ‘unfriendly’ in Table 1), is
made based on (1) the analysis of morphological
tags of nominal heads and their premodifiers in the
sentence (e.g., first person pronoun, third person
pronoun, demonstrative pronoun, nominative or
genitive noun, etc.); (2) the analysis of the se-
quence of hypernymic semantic relations of a par-
ticular noun in WordNet (Miller, 1990), which
allows to determine its conceptual domain (e.g.,
“person, human being”, “artifact”, “event”, etc.).
For ex., ‘I feel highly unfriendly attitude towards
me’ conveys ‘NEG aff’ (‘sadness’), while ‘Shop
assistant’s behavior was really unfriendly’ and
‘Plastic bags are environment unfriendly’ express
‘NEG jud’ and ‘NEG app’, correspondingly.
While applying the compositionality principle,
we consecutively assign attitude features to words,
phrases, formations, clauses, and finally, to the
whole sentence.

4 Consideration of the Semantics of Verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999366">
All sentences must include a verb, because the
verb tells us what action the subject is performing
and object is receiving. In order to elaborate rules
for attitude analysis based on the semantics of
verbs, we investigated VerbNet (Kipper et al.,
2007), the largest on-line verb lexicon that is orga-
nized into verb classes characterized by syntactic
and semantic coherence among members of a
class. Based on the thorough analysis of 270 first-
level classes of VerbNet and their members, 73
verb classes (1) were found useful for the task of
attitude analysis, and (2) were further classified
into 22 classes differentiated by the role that mem-
bers play in attitude analysis and by rules applied
to them. Our classification is shown in Table 2.

age to the body”, “Preservation”, and others. The
attitude features of phrases, which involve posi-
tively or negatively charged verbs from such
classes, are context-sensitive, and are defined by
means of rules designed for each of the class.
As an example, below we provide short descrip-
tion and rules elaborated for the subclass “Object-
centered (oriented) emotional state”.
Features: subject experiences emotions towards
some stimulus; verb prior polarity: positive or neg-
ative; context-sensitive.
Verb-Object rules (subject is ignored):

<listItem confidence="0.8630381875">
3. In case of neutral object =&gt; attitude type and
prior polarity of verb, verb score (V_score).
Verb-PP (prepositional phrase) rules:
1. In case of negatively charged verb and PP start-
ing with ‘from’ =&gt; verb valence dominance:
S &amp; V-(‘suffers’) &amp; PP-(‘from illness’) =&gt; inte-
rior: ‘NEG aff’; exterior: ‘NEG jud’.
S &amp; V-(‘suffers’) &amp; PP+ (‘from love’) =&gt; inte-
rior: ‘NEG aff’; exterior: ‘NEG jud’.
2. In case of positively charged verb and PP start-
ing with ‘in’/‘for’, treat PP same as object (see
above):
S &amp; V+(‘believes’) &amp; PP-(‘in evil’) =&gt; interior:
‘POS aff’; exterior: ‘NEG jud’.
S &amp; V+(‘believes’) &amp; PP+(‘in kindness’) =&gt; in-
terior: ‘POS aff’; exterior: ‘POS jud’.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986724545454546">
In the majority of rules the strength of attitude is
measured as a maximum between attitude scores of
a verb and an object (max(V_score,O_score)), be-
cause strength of overall attitude depends on both
scores. For example, attitude conveyed by ‘to suf-
fer from grave illness’ is stronger than that of ‘to
suffer from slight illness’.
In contrast to the rules of “Object-centered
(oriented) emotional state” subclass, which ignore
attitude features of a subject in a sentence, the rules
elaborated for the “Subject-driven change in emo-
tional state (trans.)” disregard the attitude features
of object, as in sentences involving members of
this subclass object experiences emotion, and sub-
ject causes the emotional state. For example (due
to limitation of space, here and below we provide
only some cases):
S(‘Classical music’) &amp; V+(‘calmed’) &amp; O-
(‘disobedient child’) =&gt; interior: ‘POS aff’; exte-
rior: ‘POS app’.
S-(‘Fatal consequences of GM food intake’) &amp;
V-(‘frighten’) &amp; O(‘me’) =&gt; interior: ‘NEG aff’;
exterior: ‘NEG app’.
The Verb-Object rules for the subclasses “Positive
judgment” and “Negative judgment” (verbs from
“Judgment” class relate to a judgment or opinion
that someone may have in reaction to something)
are very close to those defined for the subclass
“Object-centered (oriented) emotional state”.
However, Verb-PP rules have some specifics: for
both positive and negative judgment verbs, we
treat PP starting with ‘for’/‘of’/‘as’ same as object
in Verb-Object rules. For example:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8199675">
S(‘He’) &amp; V-(‘blamed’) &amp; O+(‘innocent per-
son’) =&gt; interior: ‘NEG jud’; exterior: ‘NEG jud’.

(‘for his misdeed’) =&gt; interior: ‘NEG jud’; exte-
</equation>
<listItem confidence="0.342058583333333">
rior: ‘POS jud’.
Verbs from classes “Favorable attitude” and “Ad-
verse (unfavorable) attitude” have prior neutral
polarity and positive or negative reinforcement,
correspondingly, that means that they only impact
on the polarity and strength of non-neutral phrase
(object in a sentence written in active voice, or
subject in a sentence written in passive voice, or
PP in case of some verbs).
Rules:
1. If verb belongs to the “Favorable attitude” class
and the polarity of phrase is not neutral, then the
</listItem>

<bodyText confidence="0.992208333333333">
attitude score of the phrase is intensified (we use
symbol ‘^’ to indicate intensification):
S(‘They’) &amp; [V pos. reinforcement](‘elected’) &amp;
O+(‘fair judge’) _&gt; ‘POS app’; O_score^.
S(‘They’) &amp; [V pos. reinforcement](‘elected’) &amp;
O-(‘corrupt candidate’) _&gt; ‘NEG app’; O_score^.
2. If verb belongs to the “Adverse (unfavorable)

“Verbs of removing with negative charge”:
S(‘Manager’) &amp; [V neg. rem.](‘fired’) &amp; O-

O(‘children’) &amp; PP-(‘from dangerous place’) _&gt;
‘POS app’; max(V_score,PP_score).
Along with modal verbs and modal adverbs, mem-
bers of the “Communication indica-
tor/reinforcement of attitude” verb class also
indicate the confidence level or degree of certainty
concerning given opinion.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.731945346153846">
Features: subject (communicator) expresses state-
ment with/without attitude; statement is PP starting
with ‘of’, ‘on’, ‘against’, ‘about’, ‘concerning’,
‘regarding’, ‘that’, ‘how’ etc.; ground: positive or
negative; reinforcement: positive or negative.
Rules:
1. If the polarity of expressed statement is neutral,
then the attitude is neutral:
S(‘Professor’) &amp; [V pos. ground, pos. rein-
forcement, confidence:0.83](‘dwelled’) &amp; PP-
neutral(‘on a question’) _&gt; neutral.
2. If the polarity of expressed statement is not neu-
tral and the reinforcement is positive, then the po-
larity score of the statement (PP) is intensified:
S(‘Jane’) &amp; [V neg. ground, pos. reinforcement,
confidence:0.8](‘is complaining’) &amp; PP-(‘of a
headache again’) _&gt; ‘NEG app’; PP_score^; con-
fidence:0.8.
3. If the polarity of expressed statement is not neu-
tral and reinforcement is negative, then the polarity
of the statement (PP) is reversed and score is inten-
sified:
S(‘Max’) &amp; [V neg. ground, neg. reinforcement,
confidence:0.2](‘doubt’) &amp; PP-{‘that’ S+(‘his
good fortune’) &amp; [V termination](‘will ever end’)}
_&gt; ‘POS app’; PP_score^; confidence:0.2.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999685">
In the last example, to measure the sentiment of
PP, we apply rule for the verb ‘end’ from the
“Termination of activity” class, which reverses the
non-neutral polarity of subject (in intransitive use
of verb) or object (in transitive use of verb). For
example, the polarity of the following sentence
with positive PP is negative: ‘They discontinued
helping children’.

site represents an interactive platform that allows
people to share personal experiences, thoughts,

We considered three hierarchical levels of atti-
tude labels in our experiment (see Figure 1). Three
independent annotators labeled the sentences with
one of 14 categories from ALL level and a corres-
ponding score (the strength or intensity value).
These annotations were further interpreted using
labels from MID and TOP levels. Fleiss’ Kappa
coefficient was used as a measure of reliability of
human raters’ annotations. The agreement coeffi-
cient on 1000 sentences was 0.53 on ALL level,
0.57 on MID level, and 0.73 on TOP level.
Only those sentences, on which at least two out
of three human raters completely agreed, were in-
cluded in the “gold standard” for our experiment.
Three “gold standards” were created according to
the hierarchy of attitude labels. Fleiss’ Kappa coef-
ficients are 0.62, 0.63, and 0.74 on ALL, MID, and
TOP levels, correspondingly. Table 3 shows the

After processing each sentence from the data set by

ALL, MID, and TOP levels. The results are shown
in Table 4. The ratio of the most frequent attitude
label in the “gold standard” was considered as the
baseline. As seen from the obtained results, our
algorithm performed with high accuracy signifi-
cantly surpassing the baselines on all levels of atti-
tude hierarchy (except ‘neutral’ category on the
TOP level, which is probably due to the unbal-
anced distribution of labels in the “gold standard”,
where ‘neutral’ sentences constitute less than 9%).

rithm performed with the worst results in
recognition of ‘NEG app’ and ‘neutral’.
The analysis of a confusion matrix for the ALL
level revealed the following top confusions of our
system (see Table 5): (1) ‘anger’, ‘fear’, ‘guilt’,
‘shame’, ‘NEG jud’, ‘NEG app’ and ‘neutral’ were
predominantly incorrectly predicted as ‘sadness’
(for ex., @AM resulted in ‘sadness’ for the sen-
tence ‘I know we have several months left before
the election, but I am already sick and tired of see-
ing the ads on TV’, while human annotations were
‘anger’/‘anger’/‘disgust’); (2) ‘interest’, ‘POS jud’
and ‘POS app’ were mostly confused with ‘joy’ by
our algorithm (e.g., @AM classified the sentence
‘It’s one of those life changing artifacts that we
must have in order to have happier, healthier lives’
as ‘joy’(-ful), while human annotations were ‘POS
app’/‘POS app’/‘interest’).

Our system achieved high precision for all cate-
gories on the MID level (Table 4), with the excep-
tion of ‘NEG app’ and ‘neutral’, although high
recall was obtained only in the case of categories
related to affect (‘POS aff’, ‘NEG aff’). These re-
sults indicate that affect sensing is easier than rec-
ognition of judgment or appreciation from text.
TOP level results (Table 4) show that our algo-
rithm classifies sentences that convey positive or
negative sentiment with high accuracy (92% and
91%, correspondingly). On the other hand, ‘neu-
tral’ sentences still pose a challenge.
The analysis of errors revealed that system re-
quires common sense or additional context to deal
with sentences like ‘All through my life I’ve felt
like I’m second fiddle’ (“gold standard”: ‘sadness’;
@AM: ‘neutral’) or ‘For me every minute on my
horse is alike an hour in heaven!’ (“gold stan-
dard”: ‘joy’; @AM: ‘neutral’).
We also evaluated the system performance with
regard to attitude intensity estimation. The percen-
tage of attitude-conveying sentences (not consider-
ing neutral ones), on which the result of our system
conformed to the fine-grained “gold standard”
(ALL level), according to the measured distance
between intensities given by human raters (aver-
aged values) and those obtained by our system is
shown in Table 6. As seen from the table, our sys-
tem achieved satisfactory results in estimation of
the strength of attitude expressed through text.

<bodyText confidence="0.998848307692308">
In this paper we introduced @AM, which is so far,
to the best of our knowledge, the only system clas-
sifying sentences using fine-grained attitude types,
and extensively dealing with the semantics of
verbs in attitude analysis. Our composition ap-
proach broadens the coverage of sentences with
complex contextual attitude. The evaluation results
indicate that @AM achieved reliable results in the
task of textual attitude analysis. The limitations
include dependency on lexicon and on accuracy of
the parser. The primary objective for the future
research is to use the results of named-entity rec-
ognition software in our algorithm.

Reversing adjectives (e.g., ‘reduced’), nouns (e.g., ‘termination’, ‘reduction’), and verbs (e.g., ‘to decrease’, ‘to limit’, ‘to diminish’), which reverse the prior polarity of related words. 2.3 Modal Operators Consideration of the modal operators in the tasks of opinion mining and attitude analysis is very important, as they indicate a degree of person’s belief in the truth of the proposition, which is subjective in nature. Modal expressions point to likelihood and clearly involve the speaker’s judgment (Hoye, 1997). Modals are distinguished by the confidence level. 81 We collected modal operators of two categories: 1. Modal verbs (13 verbs). 2. Modal adverbs (61 adverbs). Three human annotators assigned the confidence level, which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, to each modal verb and adverb; these ratings were averaged (e.g., conf(‘vaguely’) = 0.17, conf(‘may’) = 0.27, conf(‘arguably’) = 0.63, conf(‘would’) = 0.8, conf(‘veritably’) = 1.0). 3 Compositionality Principle Words in a sentence are interrelated and, hence, each of them can influence the overall meaning and attitudinal bias of a statement.

While applying the compositionality principle, we consecutively assign attitude features to words, phrases, formations, clauses, and finally, to the whole sentence. 4 Consideration of the Semantics of Verbs All sentences must include a verb, because the verb tells us what action the subject is performing and object is receiving. In order to elaborate rules for attitude analysis based on the semantics of verbs, we investigated VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2007), the largest on-line verb lexicon that is organized into verb classes characterized by syntactic and semantic coherence among members of a class. Based on the thorough analysis of 270 firstlevel classes of VerbNet and their members, 73 verb classes (1) were found useful for the task of attitude analysis, and (2) were further classified into 22 classes differentiated by the role that members play in attitude analysis and by rules applied to them.

The annotations of words are taken from our attitude-conveying lexicon. The decision on most appropriate label, in case of words with multiple annotations (e.g., word ‘unfriendly’ in Table 1), is made based on (1) the analysis of morphological tags of nominal heads and their premodifiers in the sentence (e.g., first person pronoun, third person pronoun, demonstrative pronoun, nominative or genitive noun, etc.); (2) the analysis of the sequence of hypernymic semantic relations of a particular noun in WordNet (Miller, 1990), which allows to determine its conceptual domain (e.g., “person, human being”, “artifact”, “event”, etc.). For ex., ‘I feel highly unfriendly attitude towards me’ conveys ‘NEG aff’ (‘sadness’), while ‘Shop assistant’s behavior was really unfriendly’ and ‘Plastic bags are environment unfriendly’ express ‘NEG jud’ and ‘NEG app’, correspondingly.

The rule of propagation is applied when verb of “propagation” or “transfer” type is used in a phrase/clause and sentiment of an argument that has prior neutral polarity needs to be investigated (e.g., PROP-POS(‘to admire’) &amp; ‘his behaviour’ =&gt; POS(‘his behaviour’); ‘Mr. X’ &amp; TRANS(‘supports’) &amp; NEG(‘crime business’) =&gt; NEG(‘Mr. X’)).

(2009). The affective features of each emotionrelated word are encoded using nine emotion labels (‘anger’, ‘disgust’, ‘fear’, ‘guilt’, ‘interest’, ‘joy’, ‘sadness’, ‘shame’, and ‘surprise’) and corresponding emotion intensities that range from 0.0 to 1.0. The original version of SentiFul database, which contains sentiment-conveying adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs annotated by sentiment polarity, polarity scores and weights, was manually extended using attitude labels. Some examples of annotated attitude-conveying words are listed in Table 1. It is important to note here that some words could e</context>

We collected 138 modifiers that have an impact on contextual attitude features of related words, phrases, or clauses. They include: 1. Adverbs of degree (e.g., ‘significantly’, ‘slightly’ etc.) and adverbs of affirmation (e.g., ‘absolutely’, ‘seemingly’) that have an influence on the strength of attitude of the related words. 2. Negation words (e.g., ‘never’, ‘nothing’ etc.) that reverse the polarity of related statement. 3.
