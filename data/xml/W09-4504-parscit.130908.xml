The Quantitative Kidney DataBase (QKDB) is
a relational database that was created in or-
der to centralize kidney-related experimental re-
sults. Each result is characterized by different
attributes and the scientific paper from which
it was extracted. Currently, this database is
populated by hand by experts of the domain.
We present a corpus study of some papers that
have already been analyzed in order to exhibit
the specificities and difficulties of the extraction
process; then we propose a first solution to ex-
tract automatically the desired knowledge from
papers.

The goal of the Quantitative Kidney DataBase
(QKDB) project, as described on the web site&apos;, is to
make kidney-related physiological data easily available
to the scientific community. The emphasis is on exper-
imental results relevant to quantitative renal physiol-
ogy, with a particular focus on data relevant for eval-
uation of parameters in mathematical models of renal
function. The vast collection of heterogeneous experi-
mental data is necessary not only for evaluation of the
many parameter values but also for experimental and
clinical validation of the simulation results.
QKDB thus contains experimental results extracted
from scientific articles in renal physiology. Currently,
these experimental results are manually introduced in
the database. Each result is described by several at-
tributes, whose values are found in the text. Thus,
the manual process consists in finding all the relevant
results and their characteristics in a paper, by high-
lighting them in the analyzed paper, and then entering
them in the database. Table 1 presents QKDB records
for the following experimental results:
Mean arterial blood pressure of the anesthetized mice
was 99.315.4 mmHg in wild-type, 90.512.9 mmHg
in heterozygous, and 79.515.9 mmHg in homozygous
mice.
In addition, a curator, that is an expert of the do-
main, has to verify the validity and the coherence of

the data. In particular, the different values given to
features must be chosen at the right level of granu-
larity and must not be present with different forms
(synonyms or acronyms for example).
This process is a heavy task, and currently only 300
papers have been processed, although there are thou-
sands of relevant articles.
Our project aims at providing a tool that will help
the expert when processing a text [4, 2]. Even if there
are many works in information extraction, few of them
are dedicated to designing an assistant tool. This pur-
pose leads us to always keep a link between the in-
formation extracted and the source text, in order to
navigate easily from database to text and conversely
from text to database.
Our tool will propose the curator expert each result
given in the paper, with its contextual description, and
either the expert will validate the data, or he will enter
other values. Thus, the problem can be decomposed
into two tasks:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.910476">
• selecting relevant results;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975646592592593">
• highlighting the including passages and the values
of the descriptors for a selected result.
The information we look for can be modelled by a
template that represents the description of an exper-
imentation in kidney studies. Even if many systems
apply IE techniques to scientific papers, they are gen-
erally dedicated to the domain of molecular biology
and they often look for specific entities and some re-
lations between these entities and not for a complex
template. We can find such a problem in systems (see
for example [3]) issued from MUC evaluations [6], in
which most entities were named entities such as per-
son, organization or location names, that can be rec-
ognized using gazetteers and rules relying on linguistic
features. In our case, if the result value corresponds to
a named entity, other descriptors are domain-specific
terms, whose recognition would require to refer to an
ontology dedicated to this domain that does not exist
currently. Furthermore, it also requires the modelling
of the relations between an experimentation and each
of its descriptors.
Most systems only use abstracts for the extraction
task; only few of them analyse full-length papers [2, 5].
One of the reasons is that corpora are difficult to con-
vert into usable plain text format. However, the sys-
tems analyzing full-length papers obtain better results
than by using only the abstract. This is confirmed by

Shah’s results [8]. The authors made some measures
of keywords in papers according to the section they
belong to. They show that although the abstract con-
tains many keywords, other sections of the papers are
better sources of biologically relevant data. Neverthe-
less, these sytems look for singular relations, described
by patterns, and do not aim at filling complex tem-
plates. So, they do not have to gather the right in-
formation from the whole text. In our case, abstracts
cannot be used at all, because they do not convey re-
sults, and we must search for them in the whole text.
Thus the realization of an assistant for extracting
information that combines search in full length pa-
pers and the filling of complex templates appears to be
a complex task that presents several difficulties such
as the recognition of the relevant terminology, the re-
trieval of pieces of information in the whole text, and,
given that papers describe several experimentations
that share common descriptors and differ with other
ones, the selection of the relevant information accord-
ing to a specific result.
So, we first conducted a corpus study in order to
specify the extraction task and pinpoint its specifici-
ties and its difficulties. We developed our corpus study
based on the existence of the QKDB database (see sec-
tion 2). As we possessed the data in the database on
one hand, and the papers from which they were ex-
tracted on the other hand, we developed a tool that
automatically projects the data into the texts, i.e. that
retrieves and annotates QKDB values linked to each
experimental result. This first step allowed us to real-
ize a study concerning the ambiguities of the terms and
their variations between the database and the texts
either by visualizing the data or by computing quan-
titative criteria we have defined for characterizing the
task (see section 3). This projection was developed on
a subset of the database papers.
The second step consisted in developing a first ex-
traction system with extraction rules, based on the
projection tool and our study. This extraction pro-
cess was evaluated on another subset of papers of the
QKDB database, and this provides us a baseline for
evaluating further developments (see section 4).

2.1 Database
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999008111111111">
QKDB contains around 300 scientific articles concern-
ing kidney-related physiology from several journals
(such as the American Journal of Physiology - Renal
Physiology or the Journal of Clinical Investigation).
More than 8000 experimental results were manually
extracted from these articles by biologists. Each re-
sult is described by several parameters: quantitative
value, species, organ... In QKDB, four main tables
represent these results :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8574087">
• the table source represents an article with its au-
thors, title, publication year...
• each result is stored as a tuple of the table record,
which contains the result value, the unit, experi-
mental conditions...
• table field type contains the link between a
field type number and its description: for exam-
ple, species correspond to field type 1, while or-
gans correspond to field type 2.
• the other parameters describing the result are

<bodyText confidence="0.993368">
stored in the field table: mouse is an instance of a
field with field type 1 (species), as well as arterial
plasma, with its acronym AP, and its field type 7
corresponding to a region. Several fields are asso-
ciated to each result to describe the experimental
conditions in which it was obtained.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99661">
2.2 Articles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982194">
The articles are stored in a PDF format in QKDB.
Each article is generally composed of several sections:
title, authors, abstract, methods, results, discussion
and references. The results can be given either in the
body of the article, or in tables. For our study, we
needed to process the articles in a plain-text format,
while keeping their logical structure that we represent
with an XML structure. The conversion of PDF ar-
ticles to an XML format is being studied, but some
elements are difficult to extract from PDF, such as
tables or special characters (for instance, 1). Thus,
XHTML versions of articles in QKDB were retrieved
from the web, which is possible for some of the most
recent articles. This sub-corpus is presently composed
of 20 articles.
The articles were transformed into an XML for-
mat, which contains the following tags: title, authors,
body of the article, paragraphs, tables (with rows and
columns), and footnotes. This corpus contains about
933 QKDB records.

These are all attributes of the table record in QKDB;
they do not have predetermined values. The following

• the solute, which indicates what was measured
(for example HCO3- if its concentration was mea-

<bodyText confidence="0.998494095238096">
All these characteristics form slots of a complex tem-
plate for an experiment. They may not be filled in for
some records; only the result value is mandatory.
Here is an example of a sentence containing results:
(..) serum osmolality increased to 517 mOsm com-
pared with 311-325 mOsm in wild-type and heterozy-
gous mice.
It can be noticed that some of the information en-
tered in QKDB comes from the sentence itself (value,
parameter), but some of it is also inferred from the
rest of the article (species, organ...).
The objective of our project is to be able to au-
tomatically annotate such an experiment result in the
texts, that is to extract fillers for each slot of the exper-
iment template. Yet, a first step consisted in studying
the type of information to annotate and its expression
in the articles. Since the links between the records
and their expression in the texts was lost when the
database was populated, we had to recreate them by
projecting QKDB records into the texts (see Fig. 1) in
order to create an annotated corpus.

As was shown before, a QKDB record is composed of
a result value, and several other slots which describe
this value: species, organ, parameter... The values
of these slots can be far from the result value in the
article. The objective here was thus to project QKDB

records values in the articles and to annotate the words
expressing them, in order to study the way results are
expressed and the way their description is given. The
value of the result is often expressed the same way in
the article and in the database, since numerical values
present few variations. Yet, there might be ambiguities
when projecting the numerical value on its own to the
text: a figure such as 2 might have several occurrences
in the text, aside from being a result value. Thus,
some filters have been applied and the measurement
unit has to be found to disambiguate such numerical
values. However, these units are not always present
next to the experimental result, for example in tables,
where the unit can be expressed in a column title, and
the value in the same column, but a different row.
The projection script first detects result values from
QKDB records in the text bodies. Then, it retrieves
the values of the attributes associated to them, with
QKDB fields that act as gazetteers and we only take
into account variations in number. The following ex-
ample shows an excerpt of annotated text:

ple=”3” type=”unit”&gt; mOsm &lt;/results&gt; compared

<bodyText confidence="0.99956025">
With this basic projection, several studies have been
conducted by projecting either attribute values linked
to one measure at a time in an article, or the whole
database values in the article. The goals were to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96391275">
• show the type of information which was consid-
ered relevant for the specialists who populated the
database (in which sections are the results and
their descriptors found?);
• detect the records that were not projected into the
article because a different form was used (silence),
and conversely the records that were wrongly rec-
ognized (ambiguities);
• indicate the position of the records describing a
result with respect to the value of the result (in
the same sentence, the same paragraph or in the
rest of the text);

The study has been conducted on 5 papers, that rep-
resent 95 templates. The results of the projection were
studied quantitatively, based on the XML formats.
In order to make manual and qualitative studies, an
easily-readable format was also constructed: the XML
formats were translated into XHTML formats, with a
CSS stylesheet and an XSLT processor. The result is a
XHTML file which highlights the results and their de-
scriptors, with different colors depending on the type
of descriptor, as Fig. 2 shows.

<bodyText confidence="0.999902125">
In order to make systematic studies, we also devel-
oped an evaluation script. A reference corpus was cre-
ated (based on a first version of the articles annotated
by the projection tool), in which all QKDB records are
annotated in the texts. A script then evaluates the dif-
ference between the results obtained by the projection
(or later the extraction) and the corpus in which all
records are annotated.

3.2 Results of the projection
3.2.1 Location of relevant information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988384615385">
We expected the results to be mostly in the Results
or Discussion sections, and indeed, 94% of the results
are. The content of the comment slot is usually in the
Methods section. This will help detect the relevant
information, by giving priorities to the parts of the
article that should be annotated.
Another issue was the part of QKDB records com-
ing from tables: tables are a kind of structured infor-
mation but, since the presentation of results in tables
varies, they are difficult to process automatically. 60%
of QKDB records come from tables. This proportion
being quite high, special processes will have to be con-
ceived for extracting results in tables.

with the term urinary.
Many abbreviations were also found: mOsm is
generally used for milliosmole, but only one form is
present in QKDB.
Even for numerical values, small variations can be
observed: 0.1 can also be entered in the database as
0.10, or as 10-1. Finally, solute names can be written
in many different ways: water can also be written H20,
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, H 2 0...
All these variations have to be considered to be able
to retrieve QKDB values into texts. Another reason
for silence is that some QKDB records are erroneous;
eventually, some numerical values are the average of
two values of the text, in which case it is difficult to
find the source of the QKDB value in the text.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.577088">
3.2.3 Ambiguity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999783">
We also wanted to study ambiguities: for each mea-
sure, are there several different instances of a slot in
the same sentence or paragraph (which would make
the detection of the right instance harder)? See for in-
stance the following sentence in which there are three
values for the field tube segment: In controls ver-
sus PAN rats, Na+/K+ATPase activities were (pmol
ATP/mm/h): proximal convoluted tubule, 2954±369
vs 2769±230; thick ascending limb, 5352±711 vs
5239±803; and cortical collecting duct, 363±96 vs
848±194 (P&lt;0.01), respectively. These values will
have to be desambiguated to be associated to their
own result. In this case, either punctuation or prox-
imity to the result would constitute good criteria.
Table 2 presents results for some slots with their
degrees of correctness, ambiguity and silence, in the
context of a sentence (S) and of a paragraph (P). The
last column precises the number of records in the ref-
erence corpus for each slot. We can see that even in a
single sentence, ambiguity remains high enough.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.554402">
3.2.4 Position of the slot instances
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987888888889">
One of the goals was to study which slot instances
could generally be found close to the result value, and
when they were remote, where they could be found.
For the parameter slot, for 65% of the measures, the
parameter name is in the same sentence as the value,
which makes it easier to detect. For the solute slot,
its name appears in the same sentence as the value
in 90% of the cases. On the contrary, information
given in the comment slot, which gives details about

the experiment that could not be inserted into other
slots, such as additional information about the studied
species, is in the same sentence as the value for only
35% of the records.
As the domain is renal physiology, the organ slot
value is quite always kidney, but some articles refer to
experiments for other organs, which are always given
right before the result.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.486778">
3.2.5 Noise
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998671">
Finally, all QKDB records were considered, and pro-
jected in each article, in order to evaluate the quantity
of noise in each article, i.e. the number of QKDB val-
ues that were in an article, but were not related to an
experimental result (and thus not entered in a QKDB
record associated to this article). On 5 articles, only
one case of noise was found: an article refers to a pH
measure that is not linked to a result. That means
that most QKDB values that will be detected in the
texts should be connected to an experimental result.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998144">
3.3 Synthesis by slot
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999820956521739">
This projection enabled us to determine the most fre-
quent kinds of expressions of QKDB values in the
texts. These observations were later used to develop
an automatic annotation tool.
Numerical slots (result value, precision of the value,
and number of animals) required writting rules. The
result value is a number, which can contain exponents,
in which case the exponents are after the possible pre-
cision (9.37 1 0.77 e−4).
The precision is an integer or decimal number always
preceded by 1.
The number of animals can be preceded by n=, or
followed by a name of species.
The unit is composed of one or several base units
(such as g, m, mol), which can be preceded by prefixes
from the International System of Units (such as m, d,
h, µ). The units are joined with dots, slashs or spaces,
and can be followed by the exponent -1. They can
immediately follow the result, or be given with the
parameter studied as in Apical membrane Pf averaged
(in cm/s) 9.37 1 0.77 e−4
Parameters have predefined values in the database,
which should be completed when new articles will be
processed. Their proximity to the result value will be
a criterion to help to detect them.
Species also have predefined values in QKDB, and
their list can be easily enlarged with lexicons for ex-
ample. In 90% of the articles, only one species is men-
tioned in the article, which helps detecting the species
of an experiment, and its occurrence number is rather
high.
The comment slot contains additional information
about the species, about their treatments... The re-
sult value and the comments associated are often in a
different part of the article, since the comments usu-
ally are in the Methods section. The values of this slot
vary, so their automatic detection may be harder than
for the other slots.
For the organ slot, when it is not kidney, the organ
is specified before the result.
For other slots (such as tube segment or cell type),
the terms entered in the database are not necessar-
ily those of the texts: in articles, the terms can be
more specific or on the contrary more generic than
in QKDB. For example, proximal tubule segments be-
comes Proximal Straight Tubule in the database.

4.1 Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996296875">
In a first step, result values have to be detected in the
texts.
A numerical value was considered as a result value if
it is in the Results or Discussion sections, and is either
followed by a 1 character and another numerical value,
or followed by a unit, or in a table.
Then, each result value has to be linked to the terms
describing it. To do this, we have to explore the con-
texts of the results.
For each slot describing an experiment, a strategy
was developed. Patterns expressing the context of a
value were written. A result value can for example be
searched with the following pattern: [numerical value]
1 [numerical value] [unit] meaning that the result will
be followed its precision and unit.
To detect the units, we look for base units (such as
m, g or mol), with potential prefixes (such as k, n or
d) and postfixes (such as -1), and separated by dots,
slashs, or spaces.
The number of animal studied in the experiment can
usually be found after the phrase n=.
These are the slots with no predefined values in the
database. For other QKDB slots, we look for instances
of them in the sentence containing the result value, or
the previous one, except for the species, which can
be found with a simple strategy: the most frequent
species (or even word) can be selected, unless another
species was mentioned right before.
The objective was to build an evaluation framework,
with a first extraction system that will constitute a
baseline, before introducing variations and more com-
plex selection strategies.

<bodyText confidence="0.999985111111111">
The study was made on the rest of the corpus, thus
15 articles containing around 840 measures. First, the
result values were annotated, then the other slot in-
stances were selected either in the same sentence as
the result value, or in the same sentence and the pre-
vious one, or in the same paragraph. For tables, these
3 contexts are identical. Precision and recall values
are shown in Table 3. The precision corresponds to
the number of slots correctly annotated divided by
the number of slots annotated. The recall corresponds
to the number of slots correctly annotated divided by
the number of slots that should be annotated (those
in QKDB). When results that have not been inserted
in QKDB are annotated, their describing slots are
counted as erroneous. Thus, in order to give a more
precise idea of the extraction results for these slots,
the table also shows precision values only calculated
for slots linked to a result value of QKDB.

Recall of result values is 1: all the results are an-
notated; yet precision is around 0.5 so twice the right
number of results are annotated. Some of the erro-
neous templates do not refer to an experiment result,
while other correspond to results of experimentations
even if they have not been inserted in QKDB: either
the user has simply omitted it or he has judged it un-
interesting, because it was known by the community.
We have previously said that some descriptors were
extracted by rules. In the paragraph context of the ref-
erence corpus, 43% of attributes have to be extracted
by rules. The extraction system extracts 70% of them.
For descriptors whose extraction is based on QKDB
lists (57%), 28% of them are extracted.

Some results are wrongly annotated, as in the follow-
ing sentence:
In these studies, apical membrane vesicles were
enriched 10.5 1 0.5-fold for the luminal marker-
glutamyltransferase
The pattern [numerical value] 1 [numerical value] is
recognized, but here it is not the value of a result.
Other fields are not annotated, mostly due to vari-
ations of terms. Several types of variations were de-
tected in the projection phase: inflections, derivations,
acronyms, typographic variations. Lists are being con-
structed to detect them in the texts, and link them to
QKDB values, mostly automatically, for example with
WordNet (for some inflections and derivations). The
different variations of a term will thus be normalized
to a standard form.
Besides recognizing the terms of the domain, we will
have to work on the selection of relevant results, so
that an annotator who will use our assistant tool will
not have too erroneous propositions to discard. We
will have to define with experts where to draw the line
between recall over precision.

Template based IE systems were developped during
the MUC conferences (see [1] for MUC-7 definition
task and [7] for MUC-7 results). In MUC7, the Tem-
plate Relation Task was dedicated to extract relational
information on employee of, manufacture of, and loca-
tion of relations as the Scenario Template Task con-
sisted in extracting prespecified event information and
relating the event information to particular organiza-
tions, persons, or artifact entities involved in the event.
Some of these systems as LaSIE [6] have been
adapted to extract biological information, designing
PASTA [3]. PASTA aim at extracting information
about the roles of residues in protein molecules. The
extraction task consists of filling a template defined
by three template elements and two template relations
from MEDLINE abstracts. It makes use of syntactic
and semantic processing based on a domain model that
consists of a concept hierarchy (an ontology).
The BioRAT system [2] was designed to extract in-
formation from full-length papers, when they are avail-
able and can be converted from PDF to TEXT for-
mat. The kind of information extracted is designed
by patterns represented by regular expressions that
link words related to protein expression and interac-
tion found in gazetteers and protein names. The ex-
tracted information is located inside a sentence.
Pharmspresso [5] is also a tool for extracting infor-
mation from full texts. Like BioRAT, it searches for
relations between categories of biological entities rep-
resented by patterns that can be found in a sentence.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987375">
This paper presents a corpus study on scientific arti-
cles in renal physiology. The goal of the project is to
automatically annotate experimental results in these
articles to populate a database. These results can be
represented as a template, with slots for the descrip-
tion of the measure and the experiment fields (unit of
measurement, species, organ...).
In a first step, a tool was constructed to project
QKDB records towards articles, in order to annotate
a corpus of reference and to study the repartition and
expression of the results in the articles.
Then, a baseline information extraction tool was
created, which will now have to be completed to take
into accounts term variations, complex relationship
expressions, and qualitative information (such as the
qualitative data and comment slots).
