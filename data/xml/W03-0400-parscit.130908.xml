This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the 2003 conference on
Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2003), a SIGNLL meeting held in Edmonton,
Canada, May 31 and June 1 in conjunction with the HLT-NAACL Conference.
CoNLL-2003 is the seventh in a series of meetings organized by SIGNLL&apos;, the ACL special
interest group on natural language learning. The CoNLL meeting is intended to address all aspects
of computational natural language learning.
This year, we have a special theme on semi-supervised learning; the development of techniques
for making use of the massively available unannotated text data in order to increase accuracy of
trained language processing systems. Our keynote speaker, Steven Abney, fits this theme with a
presentation about the Yarowsky algorithm.
As in the previous three editions of CoNLL, we have a shared task session, coordinated by
Erik Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. This year the task is named-entity recognition. For
this session, training and test data were made available, and researchers were invited to apply their
learning system to this task. Seventeen systems have participated. You will find descriptions of
these systems and their results in these proceedings.
Of the 35 full papers submitted, the programme committee selected 17 papers, representative
of the state of the art in computational language learning today. We are very grateful to our
program committee and additional reviewers for the effort they put in reviewing the papers. We
are also grateful to the HLT-NAACL-2003 conference organizers on whom we could rely for
the local organization. Finally, we most gratefully acknowledge the support of our sponsor, the
Computational Linguistics in Flanders research community (CLIF) for sponsoring the invited
speaker.
