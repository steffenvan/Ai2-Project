<bodyText confidence="0.999953727272727">
In Chinese, zero anaphors occur frequently. This talk discusses
several issues in identification of zero anaphors. Syntactic tagging of
words in a running text for detection of anaphora requires specification
of argument structure for verbal elements. Verbs requiring a subject or
an object can be used to locate the position of zero anaphors. Typical
argument structures for verbs, however, often do not take into account
the expansion of the structure in discourse such as placing the instru-
ment in object position. Once the place of a zero anaphor is located,
the discourse processor will attempt to recover the entity. There may
be more than one entity in the previous context that can fit in the
argument structure of the verb. It has been discussed in the literature
that the recovery of zero anaphors requires extra-linguistic knowledge.
However, I will discuss two recovery principles that utilize linguistic
information as given in the text. The opening statement of a topic
continuity normally provides the element for ellipsis in the statements
that follow. So the first principle is to return to the opening statement
for recovery. Perceptive verbs, on the other hand, often trigger the
search of anaphors in the most recent element. This recency principle
can be broken by certain adverbial expressions that mark the turn of
the event. These principles apply within a topic continuity. The size
of a topic continuity is empirically determined to be about 50 words
with some variation.
