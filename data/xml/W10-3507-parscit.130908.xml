Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999932769230769">
The blogosphere is a huge collaboratively
constructed resource containing diverse
and rich information. This diversity and
richness presents a significant research
challenge to the Information Retrieval
community. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a method for
identification of “topic clusters” within
the blogosphere where topic clusters
represent the concept of grouping togeth-
er blogs sharing a common interest i.e.
topic, the algorithm takes into account
both the hyperlinked social network of
blogs along with the content in the blog
posts. Additionally we use various forms
and parts-of-speech of the topic to pro-
vide a broader coverage of the blogos-
phere. The next step of the method is to
assign topic-specific ranks to each blog
in the cluster using a metric called “Topic
Discussion Rank,” that helps in identify-
ing the most influential blog for a specif-
ic topic. We also perform an experimen-
tal evaluation of our method on real blog
data and show that the proposed method
reaches a high level of accuracy.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999882837837838">
With a proliferation of Web 2.0 services and ap-
plications there has been a major paradigm shift
in the way we envision the World Wide Web
(Anderson, 2007; O’Reilly, 2005). Previously the
Web was considered as a medium to access in-
formation in a read-only fashion. Weblogs or
blogs is one such application that has played an
effective role in making the Web a social gather-
ing point for masses. The most appealing aspect
of blogs is the empowerment they provide to
people on the World Wide Web by enabling
them to publish their own opinions, ideas, and
thoughts on many diverse topics of their own
interest generally falling into politics, economics,
sports, technology etc. A blog is usually like a
personal diary (Sorapure, 2003) with the differ-
ence that it&apos;s now online and accessible to remote
people, it consists of posts arranged chronologi-
cally by date and it can be updated on a regular
basis by the author of the blog known as blogger.
Moreover bloggers have the option to link to
other blogs thereby creating a social network
within the world of blogs called the blogos-
phere – in short the blogosphere is a collabora-
tively constructed resource with rich information
on a wide spectrum of topics having characteris-
tics very different from the traditional Web.
However with these differing characteristics of
blogs arise many research challenges and this is
in particular the case for the Information Retriev-
al domain. One important problem that arises
within this huge blogosphere (Sifry, 2009) is
with respect to identification of topic clusters.
Such a task involves identification of the key
blog clusters that share a common interest point
(i.e., topic) reflected quite frequently through
their blog posts. This is a special type of cluster-

ing problem with useful applications in the do-
main of blog search as Mishne and de Rijke
(2006) point out in their study of blog search
about the concept queries submitted by users of
blog search systems.
Moreover ranking these bloggers with respect
to their interest in the topic is also a crucial task
in order to recognize the most influential blogger
for that specific topic. However the blog ranking
problem has a completely different nature than
the web page ranking problem and link populari-
ty based algorithms cannot be applied for ranking
blogs. The reasons for why link based methods
cannot be used for blog ranking are as follows:
Blogs have very few links when com-
pared to web pages; Leskovec et al.
report that average number of links
per blog post is only 1.6 links (2007).
This small number of links per blog
results in formation of very sparse
network especially when trying to find
blogs relevant to a particular topic.
Blog posts are associated with a time-
stamp and they need some time for
getting in-links. In most of the cases
when they receive the links the topics
which they talk about die out.
When link based ranking techniques are
used for blogs, bloggers at times as-
sume the role of spammers and try to
exploit the system to boost rank of
their blogs.
In this paper we propose a solution for identifi-
cation of topic clusters from within the blogos-
phere for any topic of interest. We also devise a
way to assign topic-specific ranks for each iden-
tified blog within the topic cluster. The cluster is
identified by the calculation of a metric called
“Topic Discussion Isolation Rank (TDIR).” Each
blog in the cluster is also assigned a topic rank
by further calculation of another metric “Topic
Discussion Rank (TDR).” The first metric
&amp;quot;TDIR&amp;quot; is applied to a blog in isolation for the
topic under consideration and the second metric
&amp;quot;TDR&amp;quot; takes into account the blog’s role in its
neighborhood for that specific topic. Our work
differs from past approaches (Kumar et al., 2003;
Gruhl et al., 2004; Chi et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009)
in that it takes into consideration both the links
between the blogs as well as the content in the
blog posts whereas a majority of the past me-
thods follow only link structure. Furthermore we
make use of some natural language processing
techniques to ensure better coverage of our clus-
ter-finding and ranking methodology. We also
perform an experimental evaluation of our pro-
posed solution and release the resultant data of
blog clusters and the ranks as an XML corpus.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 presents a brief summary of
related work in this dimension and explains how
our proposed methodology differs from these
works. Section 3 explains the concept of “topic
clusters” in detail along with a description of our
solution for clustering and ranking blogs on basis
of topics. Section 4 explains our experimental
methodology and presents our experimental
evaluations on a corpus of 50,471 blog posts ga-
thered from 102 blogs. Section 5 concludes the
paper with a discussion of future work in this
direction.

2 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999841518518519">
Given the vast amount of useful information in
the blogosphere there have been many research
efforts for mining and analysis of the
blogosphere. This section reviews some of the
works that are relevant to our study.
There have been several works with respect to
community detection in the blogosphere: one of
the oldest works in this dimension is by Kumar
et al. who studied the bursty nature of the
blogosphere by extracting communities using the
hyperlinks between the blogs (2003). Gruhl et al.
proposed a transmission graph to study the flow
of information in the blogosphere and the
proposed model is based on disease-propagation
model in epidemic studies (2004). Chi et al.
studied the evolution of blog communities over
time and introduced the concept of community
factorization (2007). A fairly recent work is by
Li et al. that studies the information propagation
pattern in the blogosphere through cascade
affinity which is an inclination of a blogger to
join a particular blog community (2009). Apart
from detection of communities within the
blogosphere another related study which has
recently attracted much interest is of identifying
influentials within a “blog community”
(Nakajima et al., 2005; Agarwal et al., 2008). All
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973333333333">
these works base their analysis on link structure
of the blogosphere whereas our analytical model
differs from these works in that it assigns topic
based ranks to the blogs by taking into account
both links and blog post’s contents.
Along with the community detection problem
in the blogosphere there has also been an increas-
ing interest in ranking blogs. Fujimura et al.
point out the weak nature of hyperlinks in the
web blogs and due to that nature they devise a
ranking algorithm for blog entries that uses the
structural characteristic of blogs; the algorithm
enables a new blog entry or other entries that
have no in-links to be rated according to the past
performance of the blogger (2005). There is a
fairly recent work closely related to ours per-
formed by Hassan et al (2009) and this work
identifies the list of particularly important blogs
with recurring interest in a specific topic; their
approach is based on lexical similarity and ran-
dom walks.

3 Cluster Finding and Ranking Metho-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979777777778">
In this section we explain the concept of “topic
clusters” in detail and go into the details of why
we deviate from the traditional term of “blog
community” in the literature. After this signifi-
cant discussion we then move on to explain our
proposed method for identification and ranking
of the “topic clusters” in the blogosphere: two
metrics “topic discussion isolation rank” and
“topic discussion rank” are used for this purpose.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997495">
3.1 Topic Clusters
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967611111111">
As explained in section 2 the problem of group-
ing together blogs has been referred to as the
“community detection problem” in the literature.
However an aspect ignored by most of these
works is the contents of the blogs. Additionally
most of the works in this dimension find a blog
community by following blog threads’ discus-
sions/conversations (Nakajima et al., 2005;
Agarwal et al., 2008) which may not always be
the case as blogs linking to each other are not
necessarily part of communications or threads.
With the advent of micro blogging tools such
as Twitter (Honeycutt and Herring, 2009) the
role of blogs as a conversational medium has
diminished and bloggers link to each other as a
socially networked cluster by linking to their
most favorite blogs on their home page as is
shown in the snapshot of a blog in Figure 1:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.997">
Figure 1: Blog Showing the List of Blogs it Follows
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999488">
Normally those bloggers link to each other
that have similar interests and importantly talk
about same topics. Hence the idea of topic cluster
is used to extract those clusters from the blogos-
phere that have strong interest in some specific
topics which they mention frequently in their
blog posts and additionally they form a linked
cluster of blogs. As pointed out by Hassan et al.
the “task of providing users with a list of particu-
larly important blogs with a recurring interest in
a specific topic is a problem that is very signifi-
cant in the Information Retrieval domain”
(2009). For the purpose of solving this problem
we propose the notion of “topic clusters.” The
task is much different from traditional communi-

ty detection in the blogosphere as it utilizes both
content and link based analysis. The process of
finding topic clusters is carried out by calculating
a metric “Topic Discussion Isolation Rank”
which we explain in detail in section 3.3.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994033">
3.2 Rank Assignment to Topic Clusters
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999599">
As we explained in section 1, due to the unique
nature of the blogosphere, traditional link-based
methods such as PageRank (Page et al., 1998)
may not be appropriate for the ranking task in
blogs. This is the main reason that we use the
content of blog posts and lexical similarity in
blog posts along with links for the rank assign-
ment function that we propose. Furthermore we
take a blog as aggregate of all its posts for the
retrieval task.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961046">
3.3 Topic Discussion Isolation Rank
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999294833333333">
Topic Discussion Isolation Rank is a metric that
is used to find the cluster of blogs for a specific
topic. It takes each blog in isolation and analyses
the contents of its posts to discover its interest in
a queried topic. We consider a blog along three
dimensions as Figure 2 shows:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.973334">
Figure 2: Blog TDIR Dimensions
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.981603466666667">
As mentioned in section 1 of this paper we
utilize some natural language processing tech-
niques to ensure better coverage of our cluster-
finding and ranking methodology: those tech-
niques are applied along the part of speech di-
mension shown in Figure 1, for a given topic we
analyze blog post contents not only for that par-
ticular topic but also for its associated adjectives
and adverbs i.e. the topic itself is treated as a
noun and its adjectives and adverbs are also used.
For example if the topic of interest is “democra-
cy” we will also analyze the blog post contents
for adjective “democratic” and adverb “demo-
cratically.” Furthermore, a weight in descending
order is assigned to the noun (denoted as wn),
adjective (denoted as wadj) and adverb (denoted
as wadv) of the queried topic where wn&gt;wadj&gt;wadv.
This approach guarantees better coverage of the
blogosphere and the chances of missing out blogs
that have interest in the queried topic are minim-
al. The blog post number denotes the number of
the post in which the word is found and occur-
rence is a true/false parameter denoting whether
or not the word exists in the blog post. Based on
these three dimensions we formulated the TDIR
metric as follows:
1+ (nnounx wn)+(nadjective x wadj)+(nadverbx wadv)
Number of total posts
Here wn, wadj and wadv are as explained pre-
viously in this section and nnoun denotes the num-
ber of times nouns are found in all the blog posts,
nadjective denotes the number of times adjectives
are found in all the blog posts and nadverb denotes
the number of times adverbs are found in all the
blog posts. This metric is calculated for each
blog in isolation and the blogs that have TDIR
value of greater than 1 are considered part of the
topic cluster.
Additionally we also use various forms of the
queried topic in the calculation of TDIR as this
also ensures better coverage during the cluster
detection process. In the world of the blogos-
phere, bloggers have all the freedom to use what-
ever terms they want to use for a particular topic
and it is this freedom which adds to the difficulty
of the Information Retrieval community. Within
the TDIR metric we propose use of alternate
terms/spellings/phrases for a given topic – an
example being the use of “Obama” by some
bloggers and “United States first Black Presi-
dent” or “United States’ Black President” by oth-
ers. Such ambiguity with respect to posts talking
about same topic but using different phras-
es/spellings/terms can be resolved by using a
corpus-based approach with listing of alternate
phrases and terms for the broad topics. Moreover
the weights used for each of the part of speech
“noun”, “adjective” and “adverb” in the TDIR
metric can be adjusted differently for different
topics with some topics having a stronger indica-

tion of discussion of that topic through occur-
rence of noun and some through occurrence of
adjective or adverb. Some examples of these var-
ious measures are shown in our experimental
evaluations that are explained in section 4.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.872373">
3.4 Topic Discussion Rank
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999621764705882">
After the cluster-finding phase we perform the
ranking step by means of Topic Discussion Rank.
It is in this phase that the socially networked and
linked blogs play a role in boosting each other’s
ranks. It is reasonable to assign a higher topic
rank to a blog that has interest in the specific top-
ic and is also a follower of many blogs with simi-
lar topic discussions than one that mentions the
topic under consideration but does not link to
other similar blogs: Topic Discussion Rank does
that by taking into account both link structure
and TDIR explained in previous section. This has
the advantage of taking into account both factors:
the content of the blog posts and the link struc-
ture of its neighborhood.
The following piecewise function shows how
the metric Topic Discussion Rank is calculated:
damp. Note that summation of TDIR is used in
the first iteration only, in the other iterations it is
replaced by TDR of the blogs.
Furthermore it is important to note that the
process of TDR computation is an iterative one
similar to PageRank (Page et al., 1998) computa-
tion, however the termination condition is unlike
PageRank in that PageRank terminates when
rank values are normalized whereas our approach
uses the blog depth as a termination condition
which is an adjustable parameter. Due to the
changed termination condition the role of spam
blogs is minimized.
The damping factor damp is introduced to mi-
nimize biasness as is explained below. Consider
the two blogs as shown with the link structure
represented by arrows:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.9963">
Figure 3: Example for Damping Factor Explanation

Explanation of notations used:
b - blog
o : (o,b) – outlinks from blog b
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.997476130434783">
The TDR is same as the TDIR in case of the
blog having zero outlinks as such a blog exists in
isolation and does not have a strong participation
within the social network of the blogosphere. In
the case of a blog having one or more outlinks to
other blogs we add its own TDIR to the factor
.
Here matching links represent blogs that are
part of topic cluster for a given topic (i.e. those
having TDIR greater than 1 as explained in sec-
tion 3.3) and each matching link’s TDIR is
summed up and multiplied by a factor called
In this case let’s assume the TDIR of blog A is
2 and the TDIR of blog B is 1. Using the formu-
lation for TDR without the damping factor we
would have 2+(1/1x1)=3 for blog A and
1+(1/1x2)=3 for blog B which is not the true ref-
lection of their topic discussion ranks. However
when we use the damping factor the resultant
TDR’s are 2+(1/1x1x0.9)=2.9 for blog A and
1+(1/1x2x0.9)=2.8 for blog B and this more cor-
rectly represents the topic discussion ranks of
both the blogs.

4 Experimental Evaluations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999095375">
This section presents details of our experiments
on real blog data. We use precision and recall to
measure the effectiveness of our approach of
cluster-finding. The experimental data is released
as an XML corpus which can be downloaded

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.966499">
4.1 Data and Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995589">
The data used in the experiments was gathered
from 102 blog sites which comprised of 50,471
blog posts. Currently we have restricted the data
set to only the blogspot domain (blogger.com
service by Google).We used four blog sites as
seeds and from them the link structure of the
blogs was extracted after which the crawl (Qure-
shi et al., 2010) was performed using the XML
feeds of the blogs to retrieve all the posts in each
blog. Each blog had an average of 494 posts.
The topics for which we perform the experi-
ments of finding TDIR and TDR were taken to
be “compute”, “democracy”, “secularism”,
“bioinformatics”, “haiti” and “obama.”
The measures that we use to assess the accura-
cy of our method are precision and recall which
are widely used statistical classification measures
for the Information Retrieval domain. The two
measures are calculated using equations 4.1 and
4.2:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.91592875">
Precision = |Ct nCa |(4.1)
|Ca|
Recall = |Ct nCa |(4.2)
|Ct|
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999744294117647">
Here Ca represents the topic cluster set found
using our algorithm i.e. the set of blogs that have
interest in the queried topic, in other words it is
the set of the blogs that have TDIR greater than 1.
Ct represents the true topic cluster set meaning
the set of those blogs that not just mention the
topic but are really interested in it. The reason for
distinguishing between true cluster set Ct and
algorithmic cluster set Ca is that our method just
searches for the given keyword i.e. topic in all
the posts and since natural language is so rich
that just mentioning the topic does not represent
the fact that the blog is a part of that topic cluster.
Hence we use a human annotator/labeler for
identification of the true cluster set from the set
of the 102 blogs for each of the 6 topics that we
used in our experiments.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.581361">
4.2 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997986666666667">
We plot the precision and recall graphs for the
topics chosen. Figure 4 shows the graph for pre-
cision:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.995379">
Figure 4: Precision Graph for Chosen Topics
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.980329136363636">
The average precision was found to be 0.87
which reflects the accurate relevance of our me-
thod. As can be seen from the graph in figure 4
the precision falls below the 0.8 mark only for
the topics compute and secularism – the reason
for this is that for these two topics a higher pro-
portion of false positives were discovered. Not
all the posts having the word “compute” were
actually related to computing as found by human
annotator. Same was the case for the word secu-
larism – since our method searches for adjective
secular and adverb secularly in case of secular-
ism not being found hence there were some blogs
in which secular was used but the blog’s focus
was not in secularism as an idea. On the other
hand precision measures for the topics “democ-
racy”, “obama”, “haiti” and “bioinformatics”
were quite good because these words are likely
to be found in the blogs that actually focus on
them as a topic hence reducing the chances of
false positives.
Figure 5 shows the graph for recall:

<figureCaption confidence="0.977395">

mostly close to 1 for the chosen topics. This high
coverage is attributed to the part of speech di-
mension as discussed in section 3.3; this tech-
nique rules out the chances of false negatives and
hence we obtain a high recall for our method.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999643">
4.3 Additional Experiments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99964468">
In addition to experiments on the six coarse-
grained topics mentioned above we performed
some additional experiments on two fine-grained
topics and also repeated the experiment per-
formed on topic “Obama” with an additional
term “Democrats.” On formulating the cluster
with these two terms the precision increased
from 0.907 to 0.95 which clearly shows that in-
corporation of extra linguistic features into the
TDIR formulation ensures better results. Moreo-
ver the ranks of some blogs were found to be
higher than the ranks obtained previously and
this increase in rank was due to the fact that
many posts had subject theme “Obama” but they
used the term “Democrats” – when we used this
alternate term the ranks i.e. TDR more correctly
represented the role of the blogs in the cluster.
The two fine grained topics for which we re-
peated our experiments were: healthcare bill and
avatar. Additional terms were also included in
the TDIR and TDR computation process which
were as follows:
healthcare bill – obamacare
avatar- sky people, jake sully
These alternate terms were chosen as these are
the commonly associated terms when these top-
ics are discussed. At this point we provided them
as query topics but for future work our plan is to
use a machine learning approach for learning
these alternate phrases for each topic, and know-
ledge bases such as Wikipedia may also be used
to gather the alternate terms for different topics.
The precision for the topic healthcare bill was
found to be 0.857 which had a negligible effect
on excluding “obamacare”; however recall suf-
fered more on exclusion of alternate term “ob-
amacare” as it fell from 1 to 0.667. Results for
the topic “avatar” however were quite different
with a precision of 0.47 and a recall of 1; this
was due to the large number of false positives
that were retrieved for the term avatar and we
found reason for this to be that our approach does
not take into consideration case-sensitivity at this
point hence it failed to distinguish between the
term “avatar” and movie “Avatar”. Also in the
case of topic “avatar” the alternate phrases did
not have any effect and hence there is a need to
refine the approach for fine-grained topics such
as this one – we present future directions for re-
finement of our approach in section 5.

5 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999561034482759">
In this paper we proposed the concept of “topic
clusters” to solve the blog categorization task for
the Information Retrieval domain. The proposed
method offers a new dimension in blog commu-
nity detection and blog ranking by taking into
account both link structure and contents of blog
posts. Furthermore the natural language
processing techniques we use provide a higher
coverage thereby leading to a high average recall
value of 0.971 in the experiments we performed.
At the same time we achieved a good accuracy as
was reflected by an average precision of 0.87.
For future work we aim to combine our pro-
posed solution into a framework for auto genera-
tion of useful content on a variety of topics such
as “blogopedia”; the content can be obtained au-
tomatically from the blog posts and in this way
manual effort may be saved. We also plan to re-
fine our approach by taking into account the
temporal aspects of blog posts such as time in-
terval between blog posts, start post date and
time, end post data and time into our formulation
for “Topic Discussion Isolation Rank” and “Top-
ic Discussion Rank”. Moreover as future direc-
tions of this work we plan to incorporate a ma-
chine learning framework for the assignment of
the weights corresponding to each topic and for
the additional phrases to use for each of the top-

<abstract confidence="0.948537866666667">of Business Administration ntouheed@iba.edu.pk Abstract The blogosphere is a huge collaboratively constructed resource containing diverse and rich information. This diversity and richness presents a significant research challenge to the Information Retrieval community. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a method for identification of “topic clusters” within the blogosphere where topic clusters represent the concept of grouping together blogs sharing a common interest i.e. topic, the algorithm takes into account both the hyperlinked social network of blogs along with the content in the blog posts. Additionally we use various forms and parts-of-speech of the topic to provide a broader coverage of the blogosphere. The next step of the method is to assign topic-specific ranks to each blog in the cluster using a metric called “Topic Discussion Rank,” that helps in identifying the most influential blog for a specific topic. We also perform an experimental evaluation of our method on real blog data and show that the proposed method reaches a high level of accuracy.</abstract>

Previously the Web was considered as a medium to access information in a read-only fashion. Weblogs or blogs is one such application that has played an effective role in making the Web a social gathering point for masses. The most appealing aspect of blogs is the empowerment they provide to people on the World Wide Web by enabling them to publish their own opinions, ideas, and thoughts on many diverse topics of their own interest generally falling into politics, economics, sports, technology etc. A blog is usually like a personal diary (Sorapure, 2003) with the difference th</context>

Fujimura et al. point out the weak nature of hyperlinks in the web blogs and due to that nature they devise a ranking algorithm for blog entries that uses the structural characteristic of blogs; the algorithm enables a new blog entry or other entries that have no in-links to be rated according to the past performance of the blogger (2005). There is a fairly recent work closely related to ours performed by Hassan et al (2009) and this work identifies the list of particularly important blogs with recurring interest in a specific topic; their approach is based on lexical similarity and random walks. 3 Cluster Finding and Ranking Methodology In this section we explain the concept of “topic clusters” in detail and go into the details of why we deviate from the traditional term of “blog community” in the literature.

We use precision and recall to measure the effectiveness of our approach of cluster-finding. The experimental data is released as an XML corpus which can be downloaded from: http://unhp.com.pk/blogosphereResearch/data.tar .gz. 59 4.1 Data and Methodology The data used in the experiments was gathered from 102 blog sites which comprised of 50,471 blog posts. Currently we have restricted the data set to only the blogspot domain (blogger.com service by Google).We used four blog sites as seeds and from them the link structure of the blogs was extracted after which the crawl (Qureshi et al., 2010) was performed using the XML feeds of the blogs to retrieve all the posts in each blog. Each blog had an average of 494 posts. The topics for which we perform the experiments of finding TDIR and TDR were taken to be “compute”, “democracy”, “secularism”, “bioinformatics”, “haiti” and “obama.” The measures that we use to assess the accuracy of our method are precision and recall which are widely used statistical classification measures for the Information Retrieval domain. The two measures are calculated using equations 4.1 and 4.2: Precision = |Ct nCa |(4.1) |Ca| Recall = |Ct nCa |(4.2) |Ct| He</context>

Moreover bloggers have the option to link to other blogs thereby creating a social network within the world of blogs called the blogosphere – in short the blogosphere is a collaboratively constructed resource with rich information on a wide spectrum of topics having characteristics very different from the traditional Web. However with these differing characteristics of blogs arise many research challenges and this is in particular the case for the Information Retrieval domain. One important problem that arises within this huge blogosphere (Sifry, 2009) is with respect to identification of topic clusters. Such a task involves identification of the key blog clusters that share a common interest point (i.e., topic) reflected quite frequently through their blog posts. This is a special type of cluster55 Beijing, August 2010 Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on “Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources”, Coling 2010, pages 55–62, ing problem with useful applications in the domain of blog search as Mishne and de Rijke (2006) point out in their study of blog search about the concept queries submitted by users of blog search systems.

Previously the Web was considered as a medium to access information in a read-only fashion. Weblogs or blogs is one such application that has played an effective role in making the Web a social gathering point for masses. The most appealing aspect of blogs is the empowerment they provide to people on the World Wide Web by enabling them to publish their own opinions, ideas, and thoughts on many diverse topics of their own interest generally falling into politics, economics, sports, technology etc. A blog is usually like a personal diary (Sorapure, 2003) with the difference that it&apos;s now online and accessible to remote people, it consists of posts arranged chronologically by date and it can be updated on a regular basis by the author of the blog known as blogger. Moreover bloggers have the option to link to other blogs thereby creating a social network within the world of blogs called the blogosphere – in short the blogosphere is a collaboratively constructed resource with rich information on a wide spectrum of topics having characteristics very different from the traditional Web.
