<bodyText confidence="0.999881859375">
Setswana, a Bantu language in the Sotho
group, is one of the eleven official languages
of South Africa. The language is character-
ised by a disjunctive orthography, mainly af-
fecting the important word category of verbs.
In particular, verbal prefixal morphemes are
usually written disjunctively, while suffixal
morphemes follow a conjunctive writing
style. Therefore, Setswana tokenisation can-
not be based solely on whitespace, as is the
case in many alphabetic, segmented lan-
guages, including the conjunctively written
Nguni group of South African Bantu lan-
guages. This paper shows how a combination
of two tokeniser transducers and a finite-state
(rule-based) morphological analyser may be
combined to effectively solve the Setswana
tokenisation problem. The approach has the
important advantage of bringing the process-
ing of Setswana beyond the morphological
analysis level in line with what is appropriate
for the Nguni languages. This means that the
challenge of the disjunctive orthography is
met at the tokenisation/morphological analy-
sis level and does not in principle propagate
to subsequent levels of analysis such as POS
tagging and shallow parsing, etc. Indeed, the
approach ensures that an aspect such as or-
thography does not obfuscate sound linguis-
tics and, ultimately, proper semantic analysis,
which remains the ultimate aim of linguistic
analysis and therefore also computational lin-
guistic analysis.
Words, syntactic groups, clauses, sentences,
paragraphs, etc. usually form the basis of the
analysis and processing of natural language text.
However, texts in electronic form are just se-
quences of characters, including letters of the
alphabet, numbers, punctuation, special symbols,
whitespace, etc. The identification of word and
sentence boundaries is therefore essential for any
further processing of an electronic text. Tokeni-
sation or word segmentation may be defined as
the process of breaking up the sequence of char-
acters in a text at the word boundaries (see, for
example, Palmer, 2000). Tokenisation may there-
fore be regarded as a core technology in natural
language processing.
Since disjunctive orthography is our focus, we
distinguish between an orthographic word, that is
a unit of text bounded by whitespace, but not
containing whitespace, and a linguistic word, that
is a sequence of orthographic words that together
functions as a member of a word category such
as, for example, nouns, pronouns, verbs and ad-
verbs (Kosch, 2006). Therefore, tokenisation
may also be described as the process of identify-
ing linguistic words, henceforth referred to as
tokens.
While the Bantu languages are all agglutina-
tive and exhibit significant inherent structural
similarity, they differ substantially in terms of
their orthography. The reasons for this difference
are both historical and phonological. A detailed

discussion of this aspect falls outside the scope
of this article, but the interested reader is referred
to Cole (1955), Van Wyk (1958 &amp; 1967) and
Krüger (2006).
Setswana, Northern Sotho and Southern Sotho
form the Sotho group belonging to the South-
Eastern zone of Bantu languages. These lan-
guages are characterised by a disjunctive (also
referred to as semi-conjunctive) orthography,
affecting mainly the word category of verbs
(Krüger, 2006:12-28). In particular, verbal pre-
fixal morphemes are usually written disjunc-
tively, while suffixal morphemes follow a con-
junctive writing style. For this reason Setswana
tokenisation cannot be based solely on
whitespace, as is the case in many alphabetic,
segmented languages, including the conjunc-
tively written Nguni group of South African
Bantu languages, which includes Zulu, Xhosa,
Swati and Ndebele.
The following research question arises: Can
the development and application of a precise to-
keniser and morphological analyser for Setswana
resolve the issue of disjunctive orthography? If
so, subsequent levels of processing could exploit
the inherent structural similarities between the
Bantu languages (Dixon and Aikhenvald,
2002:8) and allow a uniform approach.
The structure of the paper is as follows: The
introduction states and contextualises the re-
search question. The following section discusses
tokenisation in the context of the South African
Bantu languages. Since the morphological struc-
ture of the Setswana verb is central to the tokeni-
sation problem, the next section comprises a
brief exposition thereof. The paper then proceeds
to discuss the finite-state computational approach
that is followed. This entails the combination of
two tokeniser transducers and a finite-state (rule-
based) morphological analyser. The penultimate
section concerns a discussion of the computa-
tional results and insights gained. Possibilities
for future work conclude the paper.

2 Tokenisation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998424953125">
Tokenisation for alphabetic, segmented lan-
guages such as English is considered a relatively
simple process where linguistic words are usu-
ally delimited by whitespace and punctuation.
This task is effectively handled by means of
regular expression scripts. Mikeev (2003) how-
ever warns that “errors made at such an early
stage are very likely to induce more errors at
later stages of text processing and are therefore
very dangerous.” The importance of accurate
tokenisation is also emphasised by Forst and
Kaplan (2006). While Setswana is also an alpha-
betic segmented language, its disjunctive orthog-
raphy causes token internal whitespace in a
number of constructions of which the verb is the
most important and widely occurring. Since the
standard tokenisation issues of languages such as
English have been extensively discussed (Far-
ghaly, 2003; Mikeev, 2003; Palmer, 2000), our
focus is on the challenge of Setswana verb to-
kenisation specifically. We illustrate this by
means of two examples:
Example 1: In the English sentence “I shall buy
meat” the four tokens (separated by “/”) are I /
shall / buy / meat. However, in the Setswana
sentence Ke tla reka nama (I shall buy meat) the
two tokens are Ke tla reka / nama.
Example 2: Improper tokenisation may distort
corpus linguistic conclusions and statistics. In a
study on corpus design for Setswana lexicogra-
phy Otlogetswe (2007) claims that a is the most
frequent “word” in his 1.3 million “words”
Setswana corpus (Otlogetswe, 2007:125). In re-
ality, the orthographic word a in Setswana could
be any of several linguistic words or morphemes.
Compare the following:
A/ o itse/ rre/ yo/? (Do you know this gentle-
man?) Interrogative particle;
Re bone/ makau/ a/ maabane/. (We saw these
young men yesterday.) Demonstrative pronoun;
Metsi/ a/ bollo/. (The water is hot.) Descriptive
copulative;
Madi/ a/ rona/ a/ mo/ bankeng/. (Our money
(the money of us) is in the bank.) Possessive
particle and descriptive copulative;
Mosadi/ a ba bitsa/. (The woman (then) called
them.) Subject agreement morpheme;
Dintswa/ ga di a re bona/. (The dogs did not see
us.) Negative morpheme, which is concomitant
with the negative morpheme ga when the nega-
tive of the perfect is indicated, thus an example
of a separated dependency.
In the six occurrences of a above only four
represent orthographic words that should form
part of a word frequency count for a.
The above examples emphasise the impor-
tance of correct tokenisation of corpora, particu-
larly in the light of the increased exploitation of
electronic corpora for linguistic and lexico-
graphic research. In particular, the correct to-
kenisation of verbs in disjunctively written lan-
guages is crucial for all reliable and accurate
corpus-based research. Hurskeinen et al.
(2005:450) confirm this by stating that “a care-

in Setswana
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994755">
A complete exposition of Setswana verb mor-
phology falls outside the scope of this article (see
Krüger, 2006). Main aspects of interest are
briefly introduced and illustrated by means of
examples.
The most basic form of the verb in Setswana
consists of an infinitive prefix + a root + a verb-
final suffix, for example, go bona (to see) con-
sists of the infinitive prefix go, the root bon- and
the verb-final suffix -a.
While verbs in Setswana may also include
various other prefixes and suffixes, the root al-
ways forms the lexical core of a word. Krüger
(2006:36) describes the root as “a lexical mor-
pheme [that] can be defined as that part of a
word which does not include a grammatical
morpheme; cannot occur independently as in the
case with words; constitutes the lexical meaning
of a word and belongs quantitatively to an open
class”.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999137">
3.1 Prefixes of the Setswana verb
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999463">
The verbal root can be preceded by several pre-
fixes (cf. Krüger (2006:171-183):
Subject agreement morphemes: The subject
agreement morphemes, written disjunctively,
include non-consecutive subject agreement mor-
phemes and consecutive subject agreement mor-
phemes. This is the only modal distinction that
influences the form of the subject morpheme.
The same subject agreement morpheme therefore
has a consecutive as well as a non-consecutive
form. For example, the non-consecutive subject
agreement morpheme for class 5 is le as in lekau
le a tshega (the young man is laughing), while
the consecutive subject agreement morpheme for
class 5 is la as in lekau la tshega (the young man
then laughed).
Object agreement morphemes: The object
agreement morpheme is written disjunctively in
most instances, for example ba di bona (they see
it).
The reflexive morpheme: The reflexive mor-
pheme i- (-self) is always written conjunctively
to the root, for example o ipona (he sees him-
self).
The aspectual morphemes: The aspectual
morphemes are written disjunctively and include
the present tense morpheme a, the progressive
morpheme sa (still) and the potential morpheme
ka (can). Examples are o a araba (he answers),
ba sa ithuta (they are still learning) and ba ka
ithuta (they can learn).
The temporal morpheme: The temporal
morpheme tla (indicating the future tense) is
written disjunctively, for example ba tla ithuta
(they shall learn).
The negative morphemes ga, sa and se: The
negative morphemes ga, sa and se are written
disjunctively. Examples are ga ba ithute (they
do not learn), re sa mo thuse (we do not help
him), o se mo rome (do not send him).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999873">
3.2 Suffixes of the Setswana verb
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999436875">
Various morphemes may be suffixed to the
verbal root and follow the conjunctive writing
style:
Verb-final morphemes: Verbal-final suffixes
a, e, the relative -ng and the imperative –ng, for
example, ga ba ithute (they are not learning).
The causative suffix -is-: Example, o rekisa
(he sells (he causes to buy)).
The applicative suffix -el-: Example, o balela
(she reads for).
The reciprocal suffix -an-: Example, re a
thusana (we help each other).
The perfect suffix -il-: Example, ba utlwile
(they heard).
The passive suffix -w-: Example, o romiwa
(he is sent).

3.3 Auxiliary verbs and copulatives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959176470588">
Krüger (2006:273) states that “Syntactically an
auxiliary verb is a verb which must be followed
by a complementary predicate, which can be a
verb or verbal group or a copulative group or an
auxiliary verbal group, because it cannot func-
tion in isolation”. Consider the following exam-
ple of the auxiliary verb tlhola: re tlhola/ re ba
thusa/ (we always help them). For a more de-
tailed discussion of auxiliary verbs in Setswana
refer to Pretorius (1997).
Copulatives function as introductory members
to non-verbal complements. The morphological
forms of copula are determined by the copulative
relation and the type of modal category in which
they occur. These factors give rise to a large va-
riety of morphological forms (Krüger, 2006:
275-281).

3.4 Formation of verbs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999730333333333">
The formation of Setswana verbs is governed by
a set of linguistic rules according to which the
various prefixes and suffixes may be sequenced
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996703">
68
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997928952380952">
to form valid verb forms (so-called morhotactics)
and by a set of morphophonological alternation
rules that model the sound changes that occur at
morpheme boundaries. These formation rules
constitute a model of Setswana morphology that
forms the basis of the finite-state morphological
analyser, discussed in subsequent sections.
This model, supported by a complete set of
known, attested Setswana roots, may be used to
recognise valid words, including verbs. It will
not recognise either incorrectly formed or partial
strings as words. The significance of this for to-
kenisation specifically is that, in principle, the
model and therefore also the morphological ana-
lyser based on it can and should recognise only
(valid) tokens.
Morphotactics: While verbs may be analysed
linearly or hierarchically, our computational
analysis follows the former approach, for exam-
ple:
ba a kwala (they write)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.630442375">
Verb(INDmode),(PREStense,Pos):AgrSubj-
Cl2+AspPre + [kwal]+Term
o tla reka (he will buy)
Verb(INDmode),(FUTtense,Pos):AgrSubj-
Cl1+TmpPre+[rek]+Term
ke dirile (I have worked)
Verb(INDmode),(PERFtense,Pos):AgrSubj-
1P-Sg+[dir]+Perf+Term
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998915390243902">
The above analyses indicate the part-of-speech
(verb), the mode ( indicative) and the tense (pre-
sent, future or perfect), followed by a ‘:’ and then
the morphological analyses. The tags are chosen
to be self-explanatory and the verb root appears
in square brackets. For example the first analysis
is ba: subject agreement class 2; a: aspectual
prefix; kwal: verb root; a: verb terminative (verb-
final suffix). The notation used in the presenta-
tion of the morphological analyses is user-
defined.
In linear analyses the prefixes and suffixes
have a specific sequencing with regard to the
verbal root. We illustrate this by means of a
number of examples. A detailed exposition of the
rules governing the order and valid combinations
of the various prefixes and suffixes may be found
in Krüger (2006).
Object agreement morphemes and the reflex-
ive morpheme always appear directly in front of
the verbal root, for example le a di reka (he buys
it). No other prefix can be placed between the
object agreement morpheme and the verbal root
or between the reflexive morpheme and the ver-
bal root.
The position of the negative morpheme ga is
always directly in front of the subject agreement
morpheme, for example, ga ke di bône. (I do not
see it/them).
The negative morpheme sa follows the subject
agreement morpheme, for example, (fa) le sa
dire ((while) he is not working).
The negative morpheme se also follows the
subject agreement morpheme, for example,
(gore) re se di je ((so that) we do not eat it).
However, if the verb is in the imperative mood
the negative morpheme se is used before the ver-
bal root, for example, Se kwale! (Do not write!).
The aspectual morphemes always follow the
subject agreement morpheme, for example, ba sa
dira (they are still working).
The temporal morpheme also follows the sub-
ject agreement morpheme, for example, ba tla
dira (they shall work).
Due to the agglutinating nature of the lan-
guage and the presence of long distance depend-
encies, the combinatorial complexity of possible
morpheme combinations makes the identification
of the underlying verb rather difficult. Examples
of rules that assist in limiting possible combina-
tions are as follows:
The object agreement morpheme is a prefix
that can be used simultaneously with the other
prefixes in the verb, for example, ba a di bona
(they see it/them).
The aspectual morphemes and the temporal
morpheme cannot be used simultaneously, for
example, le ka ithuta (he can learn) and le tla
ithuta (he will learn).
Since (combinations of) suffixes are written
conjunctively, they do not add to the complexity
of the disjunctive writing style prevalent in verb
tokenisation.
Morphophonological alternation rules:
Sound changes can occur when morphemes are
affixed to the verbal root.
The prefixes: The object agreement mor-
pheme of the first person singular ni/n in combi-
nation with the root causes a sound change and
this combination is written conjunctively, for
example ba ni-bon-a &gt; ba mpona (they see me).
In some instances the object agreement mor-
pheme of the third person singular and class 1
causes sound changes when used with verbal
roots beginning with b-. They are then written
conjunctively, for example, ba mo-bon-a &gt; ba
mmona (they see him).
When the subject agreement morpheme ke
(the first person singular) and the progressive
morpheme ka are used in the same verb, the
sound change ke ka &gt; nka appears, for example,
ke ka opela &gt; nka opela (I can sing).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996823">
69
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908909090909">
The suffixes: Sound changes also occur under
certain circumstances, but do not affect the con-
junctive writing style.
Summarising, the processing of electronic
Setswana text requires precise tokenisation; the
disjunctive writing style followed for verb con-
structions renders tokenisation on whitespace
inappropriate; morphological structure is crucial
in identifying valid verbs in text; due to the
regularity of word formation, linguistic rules
(morphotactics and morphophonological alterna-
tion rules) suggest a rule-based model of
Setswana morphology that may form the basis of
a tokeniser transducer, and together with an ex-
tensive word root lexicon, also the basis for a
rule-based morphological analyser. Since the
Bantu languages exhibit similar linguistic struc-
ture, differences in orthography should be ad-
dressed at tokenisation / morphological analysis
level so that subsequent levels of computational
(syntactic and semantic) analysis may benefit
optimally from prevalent structural similarities.

4 Facing the Computational Challenge
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925846153846">
Apart from tokenisation, computational morpho-
logical analysis is regarded as central to the
processing of the (agglutinating) South African
Bantu languages (Bosch &amp; Pretorius, 2002, Pre-
torius &amp; Bosch, 2003). Moreover, standards and
standardisation are pertinent to the development
of appropriate software tools and language re-
sources (Van Rooy &amp; Pretorius, 2003), particu-
larly for languages that are similar in structure.
While such standardisation is an ideal worth
striving for, it remains difficult to attain. Indeed,
the non-standard writing styles pose a definite
challenge.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.981168">
4.1 Other approaches to Bantu tokenisation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953045454545">
Taljard and Bosch (2005) advocate an ap-
proach to word class identification that makes no
mention of tokenisation as a central issue in the
processing of Northern Sotho and Zulu text. For
Northern Sotho they propose a hybrid system
(consisting of a tagger, a morphological analyser
and a grammar) “containing information on both
morphological and syntactic aspects, although
biased towards morphology. This approach is
dictated at least in part, by the disjunctive
method of writing.” In contrast, Hurskainen et al.
(2005) in their work on the computational de-
scription of verbs of Kwanjama and Northern
Sotho, concludes that “a carefully designed to-
keniser is a prerequisite for identifying verb
structures in text”. Anderson and Kotzé (2006)
concur that in their development of a Northern
Sotho morphological analyser “it became obvi-
ous that tokenisation was a problem that needed
to be overcome for the Northern Sotho language
as distinct from the ongoing morphological and
morpho-phonological analysis”.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997705">
4.2 Our approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998836333333333">
Our underlying assumption is that the Bantu lan-
guages are structurally very closely related. Our
contention is that precise tokenisation will result
in comparable morphological analyses, and that
the similarities and structural agreement between
Setswana and languages such as Zulu will pre-
vail at subsequent levels of syntactic analysis,
which could and should then also be computa-
tionally exploited.
Our approach is based on the novel combina-
tion of two tokeniser transducers and a morpho-
logical analyser for Setswana.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999939">
4.3 Morphological analyser
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999402545454545">
The finite-state morphological analyser prototype
for Setswana, developed with the Xerox finite
state toolkit (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003), im-
plements Setswana morpheme sequencing (mor-
photactics) by means of a lexc script containing
cascades of so-called lexicons, each of
which represents a specific type of prefix, suffix
or root. Sound changes at morpheme boundaries
(morphophonological alternation rules) are im-
plemented by means of xfst regular expressions.
These lexc and xfst scripts are then compiled and
subsequently composed into a single finite state
transducer, constituting the morphological ana-
lyser (Pretorius et al., 2005 and 2008). While the
implementation of the morphotactics and alterna-
tion rules is, in principle, complete, the word root
lexicons still need to be extended to include all
known and valid Setswana roots. The verb mor-
phology is based on the assumption that valid
verb structures are disjunctively written. For ex-
ample, the verb token re tla dula (we will
sit/stay) is analysed as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.6730444">

Both modes, indicative and participial, consti-
tute valid analyses. The occurrence of multiple

4.4 Tokeniser
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982615384615">
Since the focus is on verb constructions, the
Setswana tokeniser prototype makes provision
for punctuation and alphabetic text, but not yet
for the usual non-alphabetic tokens such as dates,
numbers, hyphenation, abbreviations, etc. A
grammar for linguistically valid verb construc-
tions is implemented with xfst regular expres-
sions. By way of illustration we show a fragment
thereof, where SP represents a single blank char-
acter, WS is general whitespace and SYMBOL is
punctuation. In the fragment of xfst below ‘...’
indicates that other options have been removed
for conciseness and is not strict xfst syntax :

ing];

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.985016333333333">
Finally, whitespace is normalised to a single
blank character and the right-arrow, right-to-left,
longest match rule for verb tokens is built on the
template
A -&gt;@ B  ||L _ R;
where A, B, L and R are regular expressions de-
noting languages, and L and R are optional
(Beesley and Karttunen, 2003:174).
We note that (i) it may happen that a longest
match does not constitute a valid verb construct;
(ii) the right-to-left strategy is appropriate since
the verb root and suffixes are written conjunc-
tively and therefore should not be individually
identified at the tokenisation stage while disjunc-
tively written prefixes need to be recognised.
The two aspects that need further clarification
are (i) How do we determine whether a mor-
pheme sequence is valid? (ii) How do we recog-
nise disjunctively written prefixes? Both these
questions are discussed in the subsequent sec-
tion.

4.5 Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999490636363636">
Our methodology is based on a combination of
a comprehensive and reliable morphological ana-
lyser for Setswana catering for disjunctively
written verb constructions (see section 5.3), a
verb tokeniser transducer (see section 5.4) and a
tokeniser transducer that tokenises on
whitespace. The process is illustrated in Figure 1.
Central to our approach is the assumption that
only analysed tokens are valid tokens and strings
that could not be analysed are not valid linguistic
words.

Step 1: Normalise test data (running text) by re-

“tokens” from step 2;
Step 4: Separate the tokens that were successfully
analysed in step 3 from those that could not be ana-
lysed;
Step 5: Tokenise all unanalysed “tokens” from step
4 on whitespace;

between the hand-tokenised tokens (hand-tokens)
and the tokens obtained by computational means
(auto-tokens) is necessary in order to assess the
reliability of the described tokenisation approach.
The test data: Since the purpose was to estab-
lish the validity of the tokenisation approach, we
made use of a short Setswana text of 547 ortho-
graphic words, containing a variety of verb con-
structions (see Table 1). The text was tokenised
by hand and checked by a linguist in order to
provide a means to measure the success of the
tokenisation approach. Furthermore, the text was
normalised not to contain capitalisation and
punctuation. All word roots occurring in the text
were added to the root lexicon of the morpho-
logical analyser to ensure that limitations in the
analyser would not influence the tokenisation
experiment.

Table 1 shows that 111 of the 409 tokens in

95 are correctly tokenised. Moreover, it suggests
that the tokenisation improves with the length of

The F-score of 0.93 in Table 2 may be consid-
ered a promising result, given that it was ob-
tained on the most challenging aspect of
Setswana tokenisation. The approach scales well
and may form the basis for a full scale, broad
coverage tokeniser for Setswana. A limiting fac-
tor is the as yet incomplete root lexicon of the
morphological analyser. However, this may be
addressed by making use of a guesser variant of
the morphological analyser that contains conso-
nant/vowel patterns for phonologically possible
roots to cater for absent roots.
It should be noted that the procedure presented
in this paper yields correctly tokenised and mor-
phologically analysed linguistic words, ready for
subsequent levels of parsing.
We identify two issues that warrant future in-
vestigation:
• Longest matches that allow morphologi-
cal analysis, but do not constitute tokens.
Examples are ba ba neng, e e siameng and
o o fetileng. In these instances the tokenis-
er did not recognise the qualificative par-
ticle. The tokenisation should have been
ba/ ba neng, e/ e siameng and o/ o fetileng.

phological analysis and are directly split
up into single orthographic words instead
of allowing verb constructions of interme-
diate length. An example is e le monna,
which was finally tokenised as e/ le/ mon-
na instead of e le/ monna.
Finally, perfect tokenisation is context sensi-
tive. The string ke tsala should have been toke-
nised as ke/ tsala (noun), and not as the verb
construction ke tsala. In another context it can
however be a verb with tsal- as the verb root.
In conclusion, we have successfully demon-
strated that the novel combination of a precise

For Northern Sotho they propose a hybrid system (consisting of a tagger, a morphological analyser and a grammar) “containing information on both morphological and syntactic aspects, although biased towards morphology. This approach is dictated at least in part, by the disjunctive method of writing.” In contrast, Hurskainen et al. (2005) in their work on the computational description of verbs of Kwanjama and Northern Sotho, concludes that “a carefully designed tokeniser is a prerequisite for identifying verb structures in text”. Anderson and Kotzé (2006) concur that in their development of a Northern Sotho morphological analyser “it became obvious that tokenisation was a problem that needed to be overcome for the Northern Sotho language as distinct from the ongoing morphological and morpho-phonological analysis”. 4.2 Our approach Our underlying assumption is that the Bantu languages are structurally very closely related.

Since the Bantu languages exhibit similar linguistic structure, differences in orthography should be addressed at tokenisation / morphological analysis level so that subsequent levels of computational (syntactic and semantic) analysis may benefit optimally from prevalent structural similarities. 4 Facing the Computational Challenge Apart from tokenisation, computational morphological analysis is regarded as central to the processing of the (agglutinating) South African Bantu languages (Bosch &amp; Pretorius, 2002, Pretorius &amp; Bosch, 2003). Moreover, standards and standardisation are pertinent to the development of appropriate software tools and language resources (Van Rooy &amp; Pretorius, 2003), particularly for languages that are similar in structure. While such standardisation is an ideal worth striving for, it remains difficult to attain. Indeed, the non-standard writing styles pose a definite challenge. 4.1 Other approaches to Bantu tokenisation Taljard and Bosch (2005) advocate an approach to word class identification that makes no mention of tokenisation as a central issue in the processing of Nort</context>

The following research question arises: Can the development and application of a precise tokeniser and morphological analyser for Setswana resolve the issue of disjunctive orthography? If so, subsequent levels of processing could exploit the inherent structural similarities between the Bantu languages (Dixon and Aikhenvald, 2002:8) and allow a uniform approach.

Possibilities for future work conclude the paper. 2 Tokenisation Tokenisation for alphabetic, segmented languages such as English is considered a relatively simple process where linguistic words are usually delimited by whitespace and punctuation. This task is effectively handled by means of regular expression scripts. Mikeev (2003) however warns that “errors made at such an early stage are very likely to induce more errors at later stages of text processing and are therefore very dangerous.” The importance of accurate tokenisation is also emphasised by Forst and Kaplan (2006). While Setswana is also an alphabetic segmented language, its disjunctive orthography causes token internal whitespace in a number of constructions of which the verb is the most important and widely occurring. Since the standard tokenisation issues of languages such as English have been extensively discussed (Farghaly, 2003; Mikeev, 2003; Palmer, 2000), our focus is on the challenge of Setswana verb tokenisation specifically. We illustrate this by means of two examples: Example 1: In the English sentence “I shall buy meat” the four tokens (separated by “/”) are I / shall / buy / meat. However</context>

The passive suffix -w-: Example, o romiwa (he is sent). 3.3 Auxiliary verbs and copulatives Krüger (2006:273) states that “Syntactically an auxiliary verb is a verb which must be followed by a complementary predicate, which can be a verb or verbal group or a copulative group or an auxiliary verbal group, because it cannot function in isolation”. Consider the following example of the auxiliary verb tlhola: re tlhola/ re ba thusa/ (we always help them). For a more detailed discussion of auxiliary verbs in Setswana refer to Pretorius (1997). Copulatives function as introductory members to non-verbal complements. The morphological forms of copula are determined by the copulative relation and the typ</context>

For example the first analysis is ba: subject agreement class 2; a: aspectual prefix; kwal: verb root; a: verb terminative (verbfinal suffix). The notation used in the presentation of the morphological analyses is userdefined. In linear analyses the prefixes and suffixes have a specific sequencing with regard to the verbal root. We illustrate this by means of a number of examples. A detailed exposition of the rules governing the order and valid combinations of the various prefixes and suffixes may be found in Krüger (2006). Object agreement morphemes and the reflexive morpheme always appear directly in front of the verbal root, for example le a di reka (he buys it). No other prefix can be placed between the object agreement morpheme and the verbal root or between the reflexive morpheme and the verbal root. The position of the negative morpheme ga is always directly in front of the subject agreement morpheme, for example, ga ke di bône. (I do not see it/them). The negative morpheme sa follows the subject agreement morpheme, for example, (fa) le sa dire ((while) he is not working). The negative morpheme se also f</context>

Words, syntactic groups, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, etc. usually form the basis of the analysis and processing of natural language text. However, texts in electronic form are just sequences of characters, including letters of the alphabet, numbers, punctuation, special symbols, whitespace, etc. The identification of word and sentence boundaries is therefore essential for any further processing of an electronic text. Tokenisation or word segmentation may be defined as the process of breaking up the sequence of characters in a text at the word boundaries (see, for example, Palmer, 2000). Tokenisation may therefore be regarded as a core technology in natural language processing. Since disjunctive orthography is our focus, we distinguish between an orthographic word, that is a unit of text bounded by whitespace, but not containing whitespace, and a linguistic word, that is a sequence of orthographic words that together functions as a member of a word category such as, for example, nouns, pronouns, verbs and adverbs (Kosch, 2006). Therefore, tokenisation may also be described as the process of identifying linguistic words, henceforth referred to as tokens. While the Bantu langu</context>

While Setswana is also an alphabetic segmented language, its disjunctive orthography causes token internal whitespace in a number of constructions of which the verb is the most important and widely occurring. Since the standard tokenisation issues of languages such as English have been extensively discussed (Farghaly, 2003; Mikeev, 2003; Palmer, 2000), our focus is on the challenge of Setswana verb tokenisation specifically. We illustrate this by means of two examples: Example 1: In the English sentence “I shall buy meat” the four tokens (separated by “/”) are I / shall / buy / meat.

These factors give rise to a large variety of morphological forms (Krüger, 2006: 275-281). 3.4 Formation of verbs The formation of Setswana verbs is governed by a set of linguistic rules according to which the various prefixes and suffixes may be sequenced 68 to form valid verb forms (so-called morhotactics) and by a set of morphophonological alternation rules that model the sound changes that o</context>

Since the Bantu languages exhibit similar linguistic structure, differences in orthography should be addressed at tokenisation / morphological analysis level so that subsequent levels of computational (syntactic and semantic) analysis may benefit optimally from prevalent structural similarities. 4 Facing the Computational Challenge Apart from tokenisation, computational morphological analysis is regarded as central to the processing of the (agglutinating) South African Bantu languages (Bosch &amp; Pretorius, 2002, Pretorius &amp; Bosch, 2003). Moreover, standards and standardisation are pertinent to the development of appropriate software tools and language resources (Van Rooy &amp; Pretorius, 2003), particularly for languages that are similar in structure. While such standardisation is an ideal worth striving for, it remains difficult to attain. Indeed, the non-standard writing styles pose a definite challenge. 4.1 Other approaches to Bantu tokenisation Taljard and Bosch (2005) advocate an approach to word class identification that makes no mention of tokenisation as a central issue in the processing of Northern Sotho and Zulu text. </context>

Sound changes at morpheme boundaries (morphophonological alternation rules) are implemented by means of xfst regular expressions. These lexc and xfst scripts are then compiled and subsequently composed into a single finite state transducer, constituting the morphological analyser (Pretorius et al., 2005 and 2008). While the implementation of the morphotactics and alternation rules is, in principle, complete, the word root lexicons still need to be extended to include all known and valid Setswana roots. The verb morphology is based on the assumption that valid verb structures are disjunctively written. For example, the verb token re tla dula (we will sit/stay) is analysed as follows: Verb(INDmode),(FUTtense,Pos): AgrSubj1p-Pl+TmpPre+[dul]+Term or Verb(PARmode),(FUTtense,Pos): AgrSubj1p-Pl+TmpPre+[dul]+Term Both modes, indicative and participial, constitute valid analyses.
