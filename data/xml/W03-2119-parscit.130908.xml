This paper reports an investigation of the
turn-taking functions of drawings in
graphical communication. Based on the
examination of dialogue data collected that
involve collaborative drawing interactions,
as well as spoken dialogue interactions, in a
joint problem solving task, we found that
‘drawing turns,’ in which the drawer
presents a piece of information to her
partner through drawing, had almost the
same turn-keeping effects as ‘speech turns.’

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950411764706">
Dialogue is characterized by taking turns, that is,
who should talk next and when should they talk.
Studies on turn-taking in dialogues have mostly
focused on phenomena and processes of dialogue
participants taking turns in spoken conversations.
But speech is not the only means of interaction.
We draw maps to give directions. We draw plans
to discuss floor plans. We make diagrams to solve
problems. It is crucial to take account of these
non-speech modes to obtain a comprehensible
model of taking turns as the basic mechanisms of
human interactions. It is crucial to elucidate the
nature of turn-taking in multi-modal setting, as
communication tools become increasingly
multi-modal to include such modes as free
drawings, photographs, web page references and
other visual information presentations.
Several researchers have looked at roles of
non-verbal cues, e.g., eye gaze, gestures and other
bodily movements, in coordinating turn-taking in
spoken utterances. Non-verbal cues were regarded
as ancillary to speech by providing additional
signals to support orderly turn-takings in speech
domain. In contrast, when we expand the scope of
dialogues to include multi-modal interactions, we
need to consider the possibilities of non-speech
turns, such as drawing turns, and cross-modal turn
changes, such as those between drawings and
speech.
Based on graphical communication data we
collected, we conducted a preliminary analysis on
the existence and the functions of drawing turns.
We found that drawing turns have almost the same
turn-keeping power as speech turns.

turn-taking and grounding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982799730769231">
Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson (1974) noted
surprisingly orderly nature of taking turns in our
ordinary conversations, and proposed a set of rules
to characterize the underlying mechanisms for the
turn-taking structures in dialogues.
We conduct dialogues with turn-takings
governed by the following rules.
At each transition-relevance place1 of each turn:
-If during this turn the current speaker has
selected A as the next speaker, then A must
speak next.
-If the current speaker does not select the next
speaker, any other speaker may take the next
turn.
-If no one else takes the next turn, the current
speaker may take the next turn.
In this notion of taking turns, the current
speaker presents a piece of information to the
partner in a turn. When a turn consists of clauses, it
presents a series of information. Even when a turn
consists of a single word, it also presents a piece of
information. To take a turn, the partner needs to
1 Transition-relevance place is where the structure of the
language allows speaker shifts to occur.
issue an utterance that is more than a particular
signal of acceptance of the information presented
by the current speaker.
From a different perspective, Clark (1996)
developed the notion of grounding to capture
processes with which conversants establish a set of
information as a shared common ground for
on-going (and possibly subsequent) dialogue. In a
grounding process, a conversant presents a piece of
information verbally or non-verbally, and the
partner issues a particular public signal to show the
receipt, understanding, or acceptance of that
information.
On the basis of Clark’s work, Traum (1994)
substantiated the process of grounding in a
finite-state transition model. The model specifies
what contributions individual utterance in a
dialogue make to a grounding process and how
individual contributions combine themselves to
make a sequence that completes the grounding. In
Traum’s terms, such contributions are grounding
acts, the units of utterance that can perform
grounding acts are utterance units or
UUs—according to their contribution to a
grounding process, the sequences of utterance units
that complete the grounding are discourse units or
DUs. Table 1 shows the seven categories of
grounding acts and their definitions.
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.967307">
Table 1. Seven categories of grounding acts
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.985515466666667">
Initiate An initial utterance component of a
(init) discourse unit.
Continue A continuation of a previous act
(cont) performed by the same speaker.
Acknowledgement An acknowledgement claiming or
(ack) demonstrating understanding of a
previous utterance. It may be either a
repetition or paraphrase of all or part of
the utterance, an explicit signal of
comprehension such as “ok” or “uh
huh”, or an implicit signaling of
understanding.
Repair Changes the content of the current DU.
(repair)
ReqRepair A request for a repair by the other
(reqRepair) party.
ReqAck Attempt to get the other agent to
(reqAck) acknowledge the previous utterance.
Cancel Closes off the current DU as
(cancel) ungrounded.
Now, we can define a turn as a constituent of
one or more DUs that initiate a piece of
information. The following figure schematically
shows speech turns consisting of DUs that are
made of annotated UUs.
In graphical communication, especially in
settings where one speaker gives information to a
partner, communicator not only speak but also
draw to present a piece of information. Thus, using
the definition of speech turns mentioned above,
natural questions arise as to ‘drawing turns’,
namely, turns that have analogical characteristics
attributed to speech turns.
This paper investigates this question in
dialogues in which one is instructed to inform
one’s floor plans to a partner. Do drawing turns
have similar turn-taking rules to speech turns?
How do drawing turns keep their turns?
To address these questions, we collected a
spoken dialogue data with drawings. However,
since participants used only one pen at a time, no
such phenomena as taking turns with a pen were
observed2. Under this setting, our purpose in this
study is to account for the effect of keeping turns
when participants are taking drawing turns.

3.1 Data

<bodyText confidence="0.999983">
Our data consist of 2 dialogues. Both dyads were
familiar with each other: in one case they were
close friends and in the other they were mother and
son. The objective of each dialogue is to inform
each other of their floor plans. We prepared a pen
and papers for the first dyad and two pens and
papers for the second. However, the second dyad
seldom drew at the same time. A video camera was
used to videotape dyads and drawing surfaces from
above. They participated on a voluntary basis.

dialogues in total. According to the objective of
each dialogue, a person in each dyad first
represented their plans with a drawing, and then
they communicated by pointing or adding
drawings for further explanation. Then the other
person in each dialogue did the same. Therefore,
we had four drawers in two dialogues. Hereafter,
we refer to a drawer as X and the other party as Y.
We took one representative portion from each
drawer. The length of the transcriptions varied
from one minute and 35 seconds to 5 minutes and
42 seconds. All audible words and word fragments
were transcribed, including overlapping speech,
nonlexical fillers (such as “uh”), and other
vocalizations (such as laughter and harrumph).
Silences of more than 100 milliseconds were also
written down and the time recorded.
After audible transcriptions, we added
segmented drawings in transcriptions, at which
point of the utterance the drawing segment starts
and ends. We defined the starting point as the time
the drawer begins to draw with a pen and the
ending point as the time the drawer changes grip,
does not move the pen on the shortest track, or
takes their hand off of the drawing surface.

On the basis of Traum’s finite-state transition
model of grounding, we divided all speech in our
dialogue data into utterance units (UUs), namely,
“continuous speech by the same speaker,
punctuated by prosodic boundaries (including
pauses of significant length and boundary tones)”
(Traum, 1994). One of the authors then classified
each utterance unit into one of the seven categories
of grounding acts.

<bodyText confidence="0.998924866666667">
In this section, we show a summary of the statistics
of speech and drawing data. First, we counted the
number of drawing segments and divided them into
two groups. One group of drawings were started
during X’s utterance, followed by X’s utterances or
X’s utterances followed the drawings. Another
group of drawings were started during Y’s
utterance or between Y’s utterances. We call the
former X-drawings and the latter Y-drawings.
There were 149 X-drawings and 8 Y-drawings. We
found four drawing segments by Y with Y’s finger
but we excluded these from this summary.
Second, we counted the number of utterances.

In this setting of dialogues, only X informed Y
by drawing. However, X initiated 2.7 times more
DUs than Y did. The objective of the dialogues was
for one party to inform their floor plan to the other
party. These summary data showed that
information flowed from X to Y not only by
drawings but also by utterances.

The average time of silences during drawing
was 667ms and that of during not drawing was
519ms.
The data indicates that silences during drawing
tend to be longer than those during not drawing.
This suggests that drawings function as
independent turns. An occurrence of a drawing
turn can keep the next speech turns from starting,
despite no speech is uttered at the time.

<bodyText confidence="0.999265111111111">
If drawing turns work similarly to speech turns in
terms of their turn-keeping functions, interruptions
by overlapping speech should occur about the same
amount toward drawing turns and speech turns.
Case 1 in Figure 3 schematically shows a regular
speech turn change structure, whereas Case 2 and
Case 3, respectively, show a speech turn and a
drawing turn interrupted by following speech
turns.

Table 3 shows the relative amount of speech

to indicate that drawing turns are more amenable to

Close examination of Case 3, in which drawing
turns are interrupted by the following speech turns,
revealed that some of the overlapping speech turns
were actually responses, either acknowledgments
or request for repairs, directed toward drawing
contents. An example of an acknowledgment in
the drawing context is found in the excerpt below.
act UU Utterance
init26 41.1 X: kou kocchino houni [mizumawariga ari]
(like here there is a sink)
ack26 init27 42.1 Y: [uraomote na]
(it is located back to back)
Here, X was drawing a line between two houses
she already drew before, and directing Y’s
attention toward the location of kitchen sinks in
them. Y could recognize the location of the kitchen
sinks in the two houses from the drawing, and Y’s
subsequent short utterance “uraomote na” verbally
confirmed the relative locations of them. Such
utterances were directed toward drawings and
worked to give acknowledgments toward their
contents. These types of utterances might appear
as instances of initiation acts if we only look at
speech domain, but, actually, they do not constitute
independent initiation acts if we admit grounding
acts that work across different modalities.
Table 5 shows the result of recounting speech
overlaps by excluding cross modal responses. The
result shows that drawing turns and speech turns
are exactly the same (Z0=0.26, p=0.32 two-tailed)

Generally, when it is one’s turn to speak, the other
party is less likely to cut into the turn. They try to
present their information clearly to avoid
overlapping. In other words, the present speaker’s
speech turn is some form of resistance to the other
party’s interruptions. On the other hand, during
one’s drawing turn, even though part of the
drawing period is filled with silence and during
that silence the other party could easily utter ‘init’
utterances, the data on periods silence showed that
longer silent periods were allowed during drawing.
We suppose that drawing turns has some form of
resistance to keep the other party from interrupting
their to speak.
In this study, the percentage of overlapped X’s
speech turns was 11.1%. That is to say, X’s speech
turns had 89.9% of resistance to keep turns. In the
same way, X’s drawing turns was interrupted by
Y’s ‘init’ or ‘ack init’ utterances at 12.8%, which
showed almost the same extent of resistance,
87.2%. Thus, our comparison suggests that the
turn-keeping resistance of X’s drawing turns is
almost equivalent to that of X’s speech turns.
The equivalence of the extent of resistance of
speech and drawing turns also suggests that silence
during drawing tended to be longer not because the
other party could not speak while drawing but
because he/she did not want to speak while
drawing. In other words, drawing could make an
excuse for not speaking while preserving the
smoothness of turn-taking interactions.
Finally, within the data we analyzed, all the
cases in which a speech turn overlaps a preceding
drawing turns were accompanied by co-temporal
speech by the drawer. This is schematically shown
in Case 3 of Figure 3. In more than half of these
cases, the following speech makes an overlaps to
the preceding speech as well as to the drawing
(Case 4 in Figure 4). In contrast, although
theoretically possible, we did not find any cases in
which bare drawing turns, e.g., without
accompanying speech by the drawer, were
interrupted by the following speech turns (Case 5
in Figure 4).

We conducted a preliminary study on the drawing
turns in graphical communication. Based on
collected dialogue data that involve graphical as
well as spoken interactions, we conducted an
analysis of both speech and drawing turns. We
found that drawing turns have almost the same

investigations are necessary on both semantic and
grounding contributions of drawings to develop
fuller account of graphical interactions.

From a different perspective, Clark (1996) developed the notion of grounding to capture processes with which conversants establish a set of information as a shared common ground for on-going (and possibly subsequent) dialogue. In a grounding process, a conversant presents a piece of information verbally or non-verbally, and the partner issues a particular public signal to show the receipt, understanding, or acceptance of that information. On the basis of Clark’s work, Traum (1994) substantiated the process of grounding in a finite-state transition model. The model specifies what contributions individual utterance in a dialogue make to a grounding process and how individual contributions combine themselves to make a sequence that completes the grounding. In Traum’s terms, such contributions are grounding acts, the units of utterance that can perform grounding acts are utterance units or UUs—according to their contribution to a grounding process, the sequences of utterance units that complete the grounding are discourse units or DUs.

We defined the starting point as the time the drawer begins to draw with a pen and the ending point as the time the drawer changes grip, does not move the pen on the shortest track, or takes their hand off of the drawing surface. 3.3 Coding On the basis of Traum’s finite-state transition model of grounding, we divided all speech in our dialogue data into utterance units (UUs), namely, “continuous speech by the same speaker, punctuated by prosodic boundaries (including pauses of significant length and boundary tones)” (Traum, 1994). One of the authors then classified each utterance unit into one of the seven categories of grounding acts. 4 Results 4.1 Summary of statistics In this section, we show a summary of the statistics of speech and drawing data. First, we counted the number of drawing segments and divided them into two groups. One group of drawings were started during X’s utterance, followed by X’s utterances or X’s utterances followed the drawings. Another group of drawings were started during Y’s utterance or between Y’s utterances. We call the former X-drawings and the latter Y-drawings. There were 149 X-drawi</context>
