Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars
can be used for Machine Translation. How-
ever, translating a free order language such
as Korean to English is complicated. I
present a mechanism to translate scram-
bled Korean sentences into English by com-
bining the concepts of Multi-Component
TAGs (MC-TAGs) and Synchronous TAGs
(STAG s) .
by looking in the transfer lexicon. And finally, the
target sentence is generated from the target deriva-
tion tree obtained in the previous step.
The transfer lexicon consists of pairs of trees, one
from the source language and the other from the
target language. Within the pair of trees, nodes may
be linked. Whenever adjunction or substitution is
performed on a linked node in a source tree, the
corresponding operation applies to the linked node
in the target tree.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999446533333333">
Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) were first devel-
oped by Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi (Joshi et al.,
1975). There are other variants of TAGs such as
STAGs (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), and MC-TAGs
(Weir, 1988). STAGs in particular can be used for
machine translation and were applied to Korean-
English machine translation in a military message
domain (Palmer et al., 1995).
Park (Park, 1995) suggested a way of handling
Korean scrambling using MC-TAGs together with a
priority concept. However, as scrambled argument
structures in Korean were represented as sets using
MC-TAGs, a mechanism to combine MC-TAGs and
STAGs was necessary to translate Korean scrambled
sentences into English.

Translation Using STAGs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903916666667">
STAGs are a variant of TAGs introduced to charac-
terize correspondences between tree adjoining lan-
guages. They can be used to relate TAGs for two dif-
ferent languages for machine translation (Abeille et
al., 1990). The translation process consists of three
steps. The source sentence is parsed according to the
source grammar. Each elementary tree in the deriva-
tion is considered with the features given from the
derivation through unification. Second, the source
derivation tree is transferred to a target derivation.
This step maps each elementary tree in the source
derivation tree to a tree in the target derivation tree

Canonical ordering of the arguments of transitive
verbs in Korean is SOV. Whereas the case marker
in English is implicit in the word, case markers are
explicit in Korean. This is reflected in the transfer
lexicon of Figure 1. So, the pair a in Figure 1 shows
that Korean has an explicit subject case marker i,
and the pair shows that Korean has an explicit ob-
ject case marker lul. Also, the pair 7 shows the links
between SOV structure of Korean to SVO structure
of English.

To translate sentence (1), we start with the pair -y
in Figure 1, and we substitute the pair a on the link
from the Korean node SP to the English node NP.
Then, pair 13 is substituted into the NP-OP pairs in
-y, thus correctly transferring sentence (1).

TAGs and related formalisms, due to the extended
domain of locality, can combine a lexical head and all
of its arguments in a single elementary structure of
the grammar. However, Becker and Rambow show
that TAGs that obey the co-occurrence constraint
cannot handle the full range of scrambled sentences
(Becker and Rambow, 1990). As a result, non-local
MC-TAG-DL (Multi-Component TAG with Dom-
inance Link) was proposed as a way of handling
scrambling&apos;. Later, by adding a priority concept
to MC-TAG-DL, Park (Park, 1995) suggested a way
of handling scrambling in Korean.

Tom, No:
For handling scrambling, the multi-adjunction
concept in MC-TAGs can be used for combining a
scrambled argument and its landing site. For exam-
ple, a subject (e.g., Tom) would have two Korean
structures as above. For notational convenience,
call the two structures, aAR.gsr and /3.ATegsp, re-
spectively. In general, aARg represents a canonical
NP structure and #ARg represents a scrambled NP
structure. PATZgsT, shows a pair of structures for
representing the scrambled subject argument. Call
the left structure of PARgsv, P.A.R.gr, and the
right structure, f3A/Z.g:Rs.p. flAR.g.fp represents a
scrambled subject, and 13Al2.07, is used for repre-
senting the place where the subject would have been
in the canonical sentence. Similarly, 13.117Zgo7 de-
notes a pair of structures for representing a scram-
bled object argument.
The basic idea is that whenever an argument is
not in a scrambled position, it should be substituted
into an available empty slot using the crA72,g struc-
ture. The sA.R.g structure will be used only when
the argument is in a scrambled position so that the
aATeg structure cannot be used.

For mapping Korean to English, the simple object
(NP) structure of English (e.g., the right structure of
pair in Figure 1) can be mapped to two structures,
i.e., aA7Z.g0p and /3A/Zg0p, thus generating two
possible lexical pairs.

For translating sentence (1), the crAR.Gor—NP
pair is used for Jerry (similar to the pair in Figure
1). However, in sentence (2), the OAR.gop—NP pair
should be used instead for translating the scrambled
argument Jerry (i.e., Figure 4(a)). Thus, it is nec-
essary that a Korean PAR,g structure (MC-TAG)
be mapped to an English NP structure (TAG) to
transfer a scrambled argument in Korean. I assume
that there is one head structure for each MC-TAG
structure, and that the PA7?,G71 (place holder struc-
ture) is the head structure for each 13A1 struc-
ture. The root node of the head structure is al-
ways mapped to the root node of the target (English)
structure.
Usually, the nodes in the source language should
be linked to each relevant node in the target lan-
guage, and vice versa (in STAGs). However, in the
case that it is a multi-component structure (e.g.,
0,472,g), an adjunction node need not necessarily
be linked to any node. If it is not linked to any
node of the target language, the structure can be
freely adjoined onto any available node of the par-
tially derived tree of the source language, which is
approximately what scrambling is about. However,
substitution nodes will always be linked (the differ-
ence between a substitution node and an adjunction
node is that an adjunction node does not introduce
a new structure to the partially derived tree whereas
a substitution node always does).

In Figure 4(a), the root node NP of an English
TAG is mapped to the OP node of f3A&apos;R.ggp of
a Korean TAG which is a head structure. All
the other nodes are mapped to each relevant node
except S. As it is not linked, f3A7,g8p can be
adjoined onto any available node in the partially
derived Korean tree. Actually, the restriction on
whether OAR.Ggp can be adjoined onto a certain
node does not come from the formalism of Syn-
chronous TAGs, but purely from the grammar of
Korean TAGs. Figure 4(b) shows the final derived
trees for both Korean and English after applying
4(a) to the partially derived trees.
