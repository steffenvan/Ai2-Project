<bodyText confidence="0.999670647058824">
Word segmentation is a process to divide a
sentence into meaningful units called “word
unit” [ISO/DIS 24614-1]. What is a word
unit is judged by principles for its internal in-
tegrity and external use constraints. A word
unit’s internal structure is bound by prin-
ciples of lexical integrity, unpredictability
and so on in order to represent one syntacti-
cally meaningful unit. Principles for external
use include language economy and frequency
such that word units could be registered in a
lexicon or any other storage for practical re-
duction of processing complexity for the fur-
ther syntactic processing after word segmen-
tation. Such principles for word segmentation
are applied for Chinese, Japanese and Korean,
and impacts of the standard are discussed.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929666666667">
Word segmentation is the process of dividing of
sentence into meaningful units. For example,
“the White House” consists of three words but
designates one concept for the President’s resi-
dence in USA. “Pork” in English is translated
into two words “pig meat” in Chinese, Korean
and Japanese. In Japanese and Korean, because
an auxiliary verb must be followed by main verb,
they will compose one word unit like “tabetai”
and “meoggo sipda” (want to eat). So the word
unit is defined by a meaningful unit that could be
a candidate of lexicon or of any other type of
storage (or expanded derived lexicon) that is use-
ful for the further syntactic processing. A word
unit is more or less fixed and there is no syntactic
interference in the inside of the word unit. In the
practical sense, it is useful for the further syntac-
tic parsing because it is not decomposable by
syntactic processing and also frequently occurred
in corpora.
There are a series of linguistic annotation
standards in ISO: MAF (morpho-syntactic anno-
tation framework), SynAF (syntactic annotation
framework), and others in ISO/TC37/SC41.
These standards describe annotation methods but
not for the meaningful units of word segmenta-
tion. In this aspect, MAF and SynAF are to anno-
tate each linguistic layer horizontally in a stan-
dardized way for the further interoperability.
Word segmentation standard would like to rec-
ommend what word units should be candidates to
be registered in some storage or lexicon, and
what type of word sequences called “word unit”
should be recognized before syntactic processing.
In section 2, principles of word segmentation
will be introduced based on ISO/CD 24614-1.
Section 3 will describe the problems in word
segmentation and what should be word units in
each language of Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
The conclusion will include what could be
shared among three languages for word segmen-
tation.

2 Word Segmentation: Framework and
Principles
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988105">
Word unit is a layered pre-syntactical unit. That
means that a word unit consists of the smaller
word units. But the maximal word unit is fre-
quently occurred in corpora under the constraints
that the syntactic processing will not refer the
internal structure of the word unit
Basic atoms of word unit are word form, mor-
pheme including bound morpheme, and non-
lexical items like punctuation mark, numeric
string, foreign character string and others as
shown in Figure 1. Usually we say that “word” is
lemma or word form. Word form is a form that a
lexeme takes when used in a sentence. For ex-
ample, strings “have”, “has”, and “having” are
word forms of the lexeme HAVE, generally dis-
tinguished by the use of capital letters. [ISO/CD
24614-1] Lemma is a conventional form used to
represent a lexeme, and lexeme is an abstract
unit generally associated with a set of word
forms sharing a common meaning.

BNF of word unit is as follows:
&lt;word unit&gt; ::= &lt;word form&gt;  |&lt;morpheme&gt; |
&lt;non lexical items&gt;  |&lt;word unit&gt;,
where &lt;word unit&gt; is recursively defined be-
cause a longer word unit contains smaller word
units.
Bunsetsu in Japanese is the longest word unit,
which is an example of layered maximized pre-
syntactical unit. Eojeol in Korean is a spacing
unit that consists of one content word (noun,
verb, adjective or adverb) plus a sequence of
functional elements. Such language-specific
word units will be described in section 3.
Principles for word segmentation will set the
criteria to validate each word unit, to recognize
its internal structure and non-lexical word unit, to
be a candidate of lexicon, and other consistency
to be necessitated by practical applications for
any text in any language. The meta model of
word segmentation will be explained in the
processing point of view, and then their prin-
ciples of word units in the following subsections.

2.1 Metamodel of Word Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988810846153846">
A word unit has a practical unit that will be later
used for syntactic processing. While the word
segmentation is a process to identify the longest
word unit and its internal structure such that the
word unit is not the object to interfere any syn-
tactic operation, “chunking” is to identify the
constituents but does not specify their internal
structure. Syntactic constituent has a syntactic
role, but the word unit is a subset of syntactic
constituent. For example, “blue sky” could be a
syntactic constituent but not a word unit. Figure
2 shows the meta model of word segmentation.

2.2 Principles of Word Unit Validation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998528928571428">
Principles for validating a word unit can be ex-
plained by two perspectives: one is linguistic one
and the other is processing-oriented practical
perspective.
In ISO 24614-1, principles from a linguistic
perspective, there are five principles: principles
of (1) bound morpheme, (2) lexical integrity, (3)
unpredictability, (4) idiomatization, and (5) un-
productivity.
First, bound morpheme is something like “in”
of “inefficient”. The principle of bound mor-
pheme says that each bound morpheme plus
word will make another word. Second, principle
of lexical integrity means that any syntactic
processing cannot refer the internal structure of
word (or word unit). From the principle, we can
say that the longest word unit is the maximal
meaningful unit before syntactic processing.
Third, another criterion to recognize a word is
the principle of unpredictability. If we cannot
infer the real fact from the word, we consider it
as a word unit. For example, we cannot image
what is the colour of blackboard because some is
green, not black. [ISO 24614-1] The fourth prin-
ciple is that the idiom should be one word, which
could be a subsidiary principle that follows the
principle of unpredictability. In the last principle,
unproductivity is a stronger definition of word;
there is no pattern to be copied to generate an-
other word from this word formation. For exam-
ple, in “0 ” (white vegetable) in Chinese,
there is no other coloured vegetable like “blue
vegetable.”
Another set of principles is derived from the
practical perspective. There are four principles:
frequency, Gestalt, prototype and language
economy. Two principles of frequency and lan-
guage economy are to recognize the frequent
occurrence in corpora. Gestalt and prototype
principles are the terms in cognitive science
about what are in our mental lexicon, and what
are perceivable words.
Principle of language economy is to say about
very practical processing efficiency: “if the in-
clusion of a word (unit) candidate into the lex-
icon can decrease the difficulty of linguistic
analysis for it, then it is likely to be a word
(unit).”
Gestalt principle is to perceive as a whole. “It
supports some perceivable phrasal compounds
into the lexicon even though they seem to be free
combinations of their perceivable constituent
parts,” [ISO/CD 24614-1] where the phrasal
compound is frequently used linguistic unit and
its meaning is predictable from its constituent
elements. Similarly, principle of prototype pro-

<bodyText confidence="0.99985">
vides a rationale for including some phrasal
compounds into lexicon, and phrasal compounds
serve as prototypes in a productive word forma-
tion pattern, like “apple pie” with the pattern
“fruit + pie” into the lexicon.

2.3 Principles for Word Unit Formation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992875">
As a result of word segmentation of sentence, we
will get word units. These principles will de-
scribe the internal structure of word unit. They
have four principles: granularity, scope maximi-
zation of affixations, scope maximization of
compounding, and segmentation for other strings.
In the principle of granularity, a word unit has its
internal structure, if necessary for various appli-
cation of word segmentation.
Principles of scope maximization of affixa-
tions and compounding are to recognize the
longest word unit as one word unit even if it is
composed of stem + affixes or compound of
word units. For example, “unhappy” or “happy”
is one word unit respectively. “Next generation
Internet” is one word unit. The principle of seg-
mentation for other strings is to recognize non-
lexical strings as one word unit if it carries some
syntactic function, for example, 2009 in “Now
this year is 2009.”

3 Word Segmentation for Chinese, Jap-
anese and Korean
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994818181818">
If the word is derived from Chinese characters,
three languages have common characteristics. If
their word in noun consists of two or three Chi-
nese characters, they will be one word unit if
they are “tightly combined and steadily used.”
Even if it is longer length, it will be a word unit
if it is fixed expression or idiom. But if the first
character is productive with the following num-
eral, unit word or measure word, it will be seg-
mented. If the last character is productive in a
limited manner, it forms a word unit with the
preceding word, for example, “東京Q” (Tokyo
Metropolis), “8 A” (August) or “f1HAW (acce-
lerator). But if it is a productive suffix like plural
suffix and noun for locality, it is segmented in-
dependently in Chinese word segmentation rule,
for example, “AlA|40” (friends), “ikU|I�kA L”
(north of the Yangtzi River ) or “A`f|-h” (on
the table) in Chinese. They may have different
phenomena in each language.
Negation character of verb and adjective is
segmented independently in Chinese, but they
form one word unit in Japanese. For example,
“yasashikunai” (優LくALN, not kind) is one
word unit in Japanese, but “T,|�” (not to write),
“T, |Re&amp;quot;” (cannot), “&apos;&amp;|W5V (did not research)
and “A� |_&apos;)ICA” (not completed) will be seg-
mented independently in Chinese. In Korean,
“chinjeolhaji anhta” (친절하지 않다, not kind)
has one space inserted between two eojeols but it
could be one word unit. “ji anhta” makes nega-
tion of adjectival stem “chinjeolha”.
We will carefully investigate what principles
of word units will be applied and what kind of
conflicts exists. Because the motivation of word
segmentation standard is to recommend what
word units should be registered in a type of lex-
icon (where it is not the lexicon in linguistics but
any kind of practical indexed container for word
units), it has two possibly conflicting principles.
For example, principles of unproductivity, fre-
quency, and granularity could cause conflicts
because they have different perspectives to de-
fine a word unit.

appears at the end of a phrase or a sentence.
Auxiliary particles represent a mood and a

Particles should not be segmented from a word.
A particle is always used with a word like a noun,
a verb, or an adjective, and they are considered
as one segmentation unit.

Auxiliary verbs represent various semantic func-

aspect and so on. An auxiliary verb appears at
the end of a phrase or a sentence. Some linguist
consider “ff” (da), which is Japanese copura, as
a specific category such as At�(hanteishi).
An auxiliary verb should not be segmented
from a word. An auxiliary verb is always used
with a word like a noun, a verb, or an adjective,
and is considered as one segmentation unit.
3.2.11 Idiom and proverb
Proverbs, mottos, etc. should be segmented if
their original meanings are not violated after

3.3 Word Segmentation for Korean
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989210526316">
For convenience of description, the specification
in this section follows the convention that classi-
fies words into 12 types: noun, verb, adjective,
pronoun, numeral, adnominal, adverb, exclama-
tion, particle, auxiliary verb, auxiliary adjective,
and copula. The basic parts of speech can be di-
vided into more detailed classes in terms of
grammatical function. Classification in this paper
is in accord with the top level of MAF.
In addition, we treat some multi-Eojeol units
as the word unit for practical purpose. Korean
Eojeol is a spacing unit that consists of one con-
tent word (like noun, verb) and series of func-
tional elements (particles, word endings). Func-
tional elements are not indispensable. Eojeol is
similar with Bunsetsu from some points, but an
Eojeol is recognized by white space in order to
enhance the readability that enables to use only
Hangul alphabet in the usual writing.

3.3.1 Noun
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999580583333333">
When a noun is a member constituting a sentence,
it is usually followed by a particle. (e.g.
“AI-X}_7}” (saja ga, ‘a lion is’) which is com-
posed from “Noun + a particle for subject mark-
er”). Noun subsumes common noun, proper noun,
and bound noun.
If there are two frequently concatenated Eoje-
ols that consist of modifier (an adjective or an
adnominal) and modificand (a noun), they can be
one word unit according to the principle of lan-
guage economy. Other cases of noun word unit
are as follows:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.3527515">
1) Compound noun that consists of two more
nouns can be a word unit. For example,
</footnote>

<bodyText confidence="0.996144428571428">
“손목” (son_mok, ‘wrist’) where son+mok
_ ‘hand’+‘neck’.
2) Noun phrase that denotes just one concept
can be a word unit. For example, “예술의
전당” (yesul_ui jeondang, ‘sanctuary of the
arts’ that is used for the name of concert
hall).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.595493">
3.3.2 Verb
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974714285714">
A Korean verb has over one inflectional endings.
The endings of a verb can be changed and at-
tached depending on grammatical function of
verb (e.g. “깨/뜨리/시/었/겠/군/요” (break
[+emphasis] [+polite] [+past] [+conjectural] final
ending [+polite]). Compound verb (verb+verb,
noun+verb, adverb+verb) can be a segmentation
unit by right. For example, “돌아가다” (dola-
ga-da, ‘pass away’) is literally translated into
‘go+back’ (verb+verb). “빛나다” (bin-na-da,
‘be shiny’) is derived from ‘light + come out’
(noun+verb). “바로잡다” (baro-jap-da, ‘cor-
rect’) is one word unit but it consists of
‘rightly+hold’ (adverb+verb).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.568803">
3.3.3 Adjective
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999830857142857">
A Korean adjective has inflectional endings like
verb. For example, in “예쁘/시/었/겠/군/요”
(pretty [+polite] [+past] [+conjectural] final end-
ing [+polite]), one adjective has five endings.
Compound adjective can be a segmentation unit
by right. (e.g. “검붉다” (geom-buk-da, ‘be
blackish red’))

<sectionHeader confidence="0.530182" genericHeader="method">
3.3.4 Adnominal
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995425">
An adnominal is always used as a modifier for
noun. Korean adnominal is not treated as noun
unlike Japanese one. (e.g. “새 집” (sae jip, ‘new
house’)” which consist of “adnominal + noun”).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.645278">
3.3.5 Adverb
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999245">
An adverb does not have an inflectional ending;
it is always used as a modifier of a sentence or a
verb. In Korean, adverb includes conjunction. It
is considered as one segmentation unit. Com-
pound adverb can be a segmentation unit by right.
Examples are “밤낮” (bam-nat, ‘day and night’),
and “곳곳” (gotgot, ‘everywhere’ whose literal
translation is ‘where where’).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.496269">
3.3.6 Pronoun
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999617857142857">
A pronoun is considered as one segmentation
unit. Typical examples are “나” (na, ‘I’), “너”
(neo, ‘you’), and “우리” (uri, ‘we). Suffix of
plural “들” (deul, ‘-s’) can be attached to some
of pronouns in Korean. (e.g. “너희들” (neohui-
deul, ‘you+PLURAL’), “그들” (geu-deul, ‘they’
_ ‘he/she+PLURAL’)).

<bodyText confidence="0.99721025">
A numeral is considered as one segmentation
unit: e.g. “하나” (hana, ‘one’), “첫째” (cheojjae,
‘first’). Also figures are treated as one unit like
“2009 년” (the year 2009).

3.3.9 Particle

<bodyText confidence="0.9998696">
Korean particles can not be segmented from a
word just like Japanese particles. A particle is
always used with a word like a noun, a verb, or
an adjective, but it is considered as one segmen-
tation unit.
Particles can be divided into two main types.
One is a case particle that serves as a case marker.
The other is an auxiliary particle that appears at
the end of a phrase or a sentence. Auxiliary par-
ticle represents a mood and a tense.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.512049" genericHeader="method">
3.3.10 Auxiliary verb
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999565">
A Korean auxiliary verb represents various se-
mantic functions such as a capability, a voice, a
tense, an aspect and so on.
Auxiliary verb is only used with a verb plus
endings with special word ending depending on
the auxiliary verb. For example, “보다” (boda,
‘try to’), an auxiliary verb has the same inflec-
tional endings but it should follow a main verb
with a connective ending “어” (eo) or “고” (‘go’).
Consider “try to eat” in English where “eat” is a
main verb, and “try” is an auxiliary verb with
specialized connective “to”. In this case, we need
two Korean Eojeols that corresponds to “eat +
to” and “try”. Because “to” is a functional ele-
ment that is attached after main verb “eat”, it
constitutes one Eojeol. It causes a conflict be-
tween Eojeol and word unit. That means every
Eojeol cannot be a word unit. What are the word
units and Eojeols in this case? There are two
choices: (1) “eat+to” and “try”, (2) “eat”+ “to
try”. According to the definition of Eojeol, (1) is
correct for two concatenated Eojeols. But if the
syntactic processing is preferable, (2) is more
likely to be a candidate of word units.

3.3.11 Auxiliary adjective

<bodyText confidence="0.99970075">
Unlike Japanese, there is auxiliary adjective in
Korean. Function and usage of it are very similar
to auxiliary verb. Auxiliary adjective is consi-

<bodyText confidence="0.999863142857143">
Auxiliary verb can be used with a verb or ad-
jective plus endings with special word ending
depending on the auxiliary adjective. For exam-
ple, in “T&apos;1131 a1q” (meokgo sipda, ‘want to
eat’), sipda is an auxiliary adjective whose mean-
ing is ‘want’ while meok is a main verb ‘want’
and go corresponds to ‘to’; so meokgo is ‘to eat’.

<bodyText confidence="0.999054666666667">
Ending is attached to the root of verb and adjec-

There are two endings: prefinal ending and fi-
nal ending. They are functional elements to
represent honorific, past, or future functions in
prefinal position, and declarative (-da) or con-
cessive (-na)-functions in final ending. Ending is
not a segmentation unit in Korean. It is just a unit
for inflection.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99982592">
Word segmentation standard is to recommend
what type of word sequences should be identified
as one word unit in order to process the syntactic
parsing. Principles of word segmentation want to
provide the measure of such word units. But
principles of frequency and language economy
are based on a statistical measure, which will be
decided by some practical purpose.
Word segmentation in each language is
somewhat different according to already made
word segmentation regulation, even violating one
or more principles of word segmentation. In the
future, we have to discuss the more synchronized
word unit concept because we now live in a mul-
ti-lingual environment. For example, consider
figure 3. Its English literal translation is “white
vegetable and pig meat”, where “white vegeta-
ble” (0) is an unproductive word pattern and
forms one word unit without component word
units, and “pig meat” in Chinese means one Eng-
lish word “pork”. So “pig meat” (MA) is the
longest word unit in this case. But in Japanese
and Korean, “pig meat” in Chinese characters
cannot be two word units, because each compo-
nent character is not used independently.

<bodyText confidence="0.999963652173913">
What could be shared among three languages
for word segmentation? The common things are
not so much among CJK. The Chinese character
derived nouns are sharable for its word unit
structure, but not the whole. On the other hand,
there are many common things between Korean
and Japanese. Some Korean word endings and
Japanese auxiliary verbs have the same functions.
It will be an interesting study to compare for the
processing purpose.
The future work will include the role of word
unit in machine translation. If the corresponding
word sequences have one word unit in one lan-
guage, it is one symptom to recognize one word
unit in other languages. It could be “principle of
multi-lingual alignment.”
The concept of “word unit” is to broaden the
view about what could be registered in lexicon of
natural language processing purpose, without
much linguistic representation. In the result, we
would like to promote such language resource
sharing in public, not just dictionaries of words
in usual manner but of word units.

What is a word unit is judged by principles for its internal integrity and external use constraints. A word unit’s internal structure is bound by principles of lexical integrity, unpredictability and so on in order to represent one syntactically meaningful unit. Principles for external use include language economy and frequency such that word units could be registered in a lexicon or any other storage for practical reduction of processing complexity for the further syntactic processing after word segmentation. Such principles for word segmentation are applied for Chinese, Japanese and Korean, and impacts of the standard are discussed.</abstract>
