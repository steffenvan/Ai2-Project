We describe a WordNet-based system for
the extraction of semantic relations be-
tween pairs of nominals appearing in
English texts. The system adopts a
lightweight approach, based on training
a Bayesian Network classifier using large
sets of binary features. Our features con-
sider: i) the context surrounding the an-
notated nominals, and ii) different types
of knowledge extracted from WordNet, in-
cluding direct and explicit relations be-
tween the annotated nominals, and more
general and implicit evidence (e.g. seman-
tic boundary collocations). The system
achieved a Macro-averaged F1 of 68.02%
on the “Multi-Way Classification of Se-
mantic Relations Between Pairs of Nom-
inals” task (Task #8) at SemEval-2010.

The “Multi-Way Classification of Semantic Re-
lations Between Pairs of Nominals” task at
SemEval-2010 (Hendrickx et al., 2010) consists
in: i) selecting from an inventory of nine possi-
ble relations the one that most likely holds be-
tween two annotated nominals appearing in the in-
put sentence, and ii) specifying the order of the
nominals as the arguments of the relation. In con-
trast with the semantic relations classification task
(Task #4) at SemEval-2007 (Girju et al., 2007),
which treated each semantic relation separately as
a single two-class (positive vs. negative) classifi-
cation task, this year’s edition of the challenge pre-
sented participating systems with a more difficult
and realistic multi-way setup, where the relation
Other can also be assigned if none of the nine re-
lations is suitable for a given sentence. Examples
of the possible markable relations are reported in
Table 11.
The objective of our experiments with the pro-
posed task is to develop a Relation Extraction sys-
tem based on shallow linguistic processing, taking
the most from available thesauri and ontologies.
As a first step in this direction, our submitted runs
have been obtained by processing the input sen-
tences only to lemmatize their terms, and by using
WordNet as the sole source of knowledge.
Similar to other approaches (Moldovan and
Badulescu, 2009; Beamer et al., 2009), our sys-
tem makes use of semantic boundaries extracted
from the WordNet IS-A backbone. Such bound-
aries (i.e. divisions in the WordNet hierarchy
that best generalize over the training examples)
are used to define pairs of high-level synsets with
high correlation with specific relations. For in-
stance, &lt;microorganism#1, happening#1&gt; and
&lt;writing#1, consequence#1&gt; are extracted from
the training data as valid high-level collocations
respectively for the relations Cause-Effect and
Message-Topic. Besides exploiting the Word-
Net IS-A hierarchy, the system also uses the
holo-/meronymy relations, and information de-
rived from the WordNet glosses to capture specific
relations such as Member-Collection and Product-
Producer. In addition, the context surrounding
the annotated nominals is represented as a bag-of-
words/synonyms to enhance the relation extraction
process. Several experiments have been carried
out encoding all the information as large sets of
binary features (up to ∼6200) to train a Bayesian
Network classifier available in the Weka2 toolkit.

been handled separately, and assigned to different
classes (thus obtaining 18 classes for the nine tar-
get relations, plus one for the Other relation).
The following sections overview our experi-
ments, describing the features used by the sys-
tem (Section 2), and the submitted runs with the
achieved results (Section 3). A concluding discus-
sion on the results is provided in Section 4.

2 Features used
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999768">
The system uses two types of boolean features:
WordNet features, and context features.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995065">
2.1 WordNet features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996417072727273">
WordNet features consider different types of
knowledge extracted from WordNet 3.0.
Semantic boundary collocations. Collocations
of high-level synsets featuring a high correlation
with specific relations are acquired from the train-
ing set using a bottom-up approach. Starting from
the nominals annotated in the training sentences
(&lt;e1&gt; and &lt;e2&gt;), the WordNet IS-A backbone is
climbed to collect all their ancestors. Then, all the
ancestors’ collocations occurring at least n times
for at most m relations are retained, and treated
as boolean features (set to 1 for a given sentence
if its annotated nominals appear among their hy-
ponyms). The n and m parameters are optimized
on the training set.
Holo-/meronymy relations. These boolean fea-
tures are set to 1 every time a pair of annotated
nominals in a sentence is directly connected by
holo-/meronyny relations. They are particularly
appropriate to capture the Component-Whole and
Member-Collection relations, as in the 8th exam-
ple in Table 1 (where tree#1 is an holonym of
forest#1). Due to time constraints, we did not
explore the possibility to generalize these fea-
tures considering transitive closures of the nomi-
nals’ hypo-/hypernyms. This possibility could al-
low to handle sentences like “A &lt;e1&gt;herd&lt;/e1&gt;
is a large group of &lt;e2&gt;animals&lt;/e2&gt;.” Here,
though herd#1 and animal#1 are not directly con-
nected by the meronymy relation, all the herd#1
meronyms have animal#1 as a common ancestor.
Glosses. Given a pair of annotated nominals
&lt;e1&gt;,&lt;e2&gt;, these features are set to 1 every time
either &lt;e1&gt; appears in the gloss of &lt;e2&gt;, or
vice-versa. They are intended to support the dis-
covery of relations in the case of consecutive nom-
inals (e.g. honey#1 and bee#1 in the 3rd example
in Table 1), where contextual information does not
provide sufficient clues to make a choice. In our
experiments we extracted features from both tok-
enized and lemmatized words (both nominals, and
gloss words). Also in this case, due to time con-
straints we did not explore the possibility to gener-
alize the feature considering the nominals’ hypo-
/hypernyms. This possibility could allow to handle
sentences like examples 1 and 4 in Table 1. For
instance in example 4, the gloss of “bottle” con-
tains two hypernyms of wine#1, namely drink#3
and liquid#1, that could successfully trigger the
Content-Container relation.
Synonyms. While the previous features operate
with the annotated nominals, WordNet synonyms
are used to generalize the other terms in the sen-
tence, allowing to extract different types of con-
textual features (see the next Section).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998049">
2.2 Context features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999149333333333">
Besides the annotated nominals, also specific
words (and word combinations) appearing in the
surrounding context often contribute to trigger the

target relations. Distributional evidence is cap-
tured by considering word contexts before, be-
tween, and after the annotated nominals. To this
aim, we experimented with windows of different
size, containing words that occur in the training
set a variable number of times. Both the parame-
ters (i.e. the size of the windows, and the number
of occurrences) are optimized on training data. In
our experiments we extracted contextual features
from lemmatized sentences.

Our participation to the SemEval-2010 Task
#8 consisted in four runs, with the best one
(FBK NK-RES1) achieving a Macro-averaged F1

sion, the overall training and test running times are
about 12’30” and 1’30” respectively, on an Intel
Core2 Quad 2.66GHz with 4GB RAM.
FBK NK-REST. This run has been obtained
adopting a conservative approach, trying to min-
imize the risk of overfitting the training data. The
features used can be summarized as follows:

Based on the observation of system’s behaviour on
the training data, the objectives of this run were to:
i) add more collocations as features, ii) increase
the importance of terms appearing in the left con-
text, iii) reduce the importance of terms appearing
in the right context, and iv) increase the possibil-
ity of matching the nominals with gloss terms by
considering their respective lemmas. On the train-
ing set, the classifier (trained with 2998 features)
achieves 66.92% Accuracy (5353 correctly classi-
fied instances), and a Macro F1 of 79.56%.
FBK NK-RES3. Similar to the second run, but
considering the synonyms of the most frequent
sense of the words between &lt;e1&gt; and &lt;e2&gt;.
The goal of this run was to generalize the con-
text between nominals, by considering word lem-
mas. On the training set, the classifier (trained
with 2998 features) achieves an Accuracy of
64.94% (5195 correctly classified instances), and
a Macro F1 of 77.38%.
FBK NK-RES4. Similar to the second run, but
considering semantic boundary collocations oc-
curring at least 7 times in the training set (m
param.), for at most 3 relations (n param.).
The goal of this run was to further increase the
number of collocations used as features. On the
training set, the classifier (trained with 6233 fea-
tures) achieves achieves 68.12% Accuracy (5449
correct classifications), and 82.24% Macro F1.
As regards the results on the test set, Table 2 re-
ports the scores achieved by each run using differ-
ent portions of the training set (1000, 2000, 4000,
8000 examples), while Figure 1 shows the learn-

decrease from Run2 to Run43 clearly indicates an
overfitting problem. Though suitable to model the
training data, the additional collocations were not
encountered in the test set. This caused a bias to-
wards the Other relation, which reduced the over-
all performance of the system.
Regarding our best run, Figure 1 shows dif-
ferent system’s behaviours with the different tar-
get relations. For some of them (e.g. Entity-
Destination, Cause-Effect) better results are mo-
tivated by the fact that they are often triggered
by frequent unambiguous word patterns (e.g.
“&lt;e1&gt;has been moved to a &lt;e2&gt;”, “&lt;e1&gt;
causes &lt;e2&gt;”). Such relations are effectively
handled by the context features which, in contrast,
are inadequate for those expressed with high lex-
ical variability. This is particularly evident with
the Other relation, for which the acquired context
features poorly discriminate positive from nega-
tive examples even on the training set.
For some relations additional evidence is suc-
cessfully brought by the WordNet features. For
instance, the good results for Member-Collection
demonstrate the usefulness of the holo-/meronymy
features.
As regards semantic boundary collocations, to
check their effectiveness we performed a post-hoc
analysis of those used in our best run. Such anal-
ysis was done in two ways: i) by counting the
number of collocations acquired on the training
set for each relation Ri, and ii) by calculating the
ambiguity of each Ri’s collocation on the train-

<footnote confidence="0.901453">
3The only difference between Run2 and Run4 is the addi-
tion of around 4000 semantic boundary collocations, which
lead to an overall 2.4% F1 performance decrease. The de-
crease mainly comes in terms of Recall (from 65.91% in
Run2 to 63.35% in Run4).

ing set (i.e. the average number of other relations
activated by the collocation). The analysis re-
vealed that the top performing relations (Member-
Collection, Entity-Destination, Cause-Effect, and
Content-Container) are those for which we ac-
quired lots of unambiguous collocations. These
findings also explain the poor performance on the
Instrument-Agency and the Other relation. For
Instrument-Agency we extracted the lowest num-
ber of collocations, which were also the most am-
biguous ones. For the Other relation the high am-
biguity of the collocations extracted is not com-
pensated by their huge number (around 50% of the
total collocations acquired).
In conclusion, considering i) the level of pro-
cessing required (only lemmatization), ii) the fact
that WordNet is used as the sole source of knowl-
edge, and iii) the many possible solutions left
unexplored due to time constraints, our results
demonstrate the validity of our approach, de-
spite its simplicity. Future research will focus
on a better use of semantic boundary colloca-
tions, on more refined ways to extract knowledge
from WordNet, and on integrating other knowl-
edge sources (e.g. SUMO, YAGO, Cyc).
