1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99961525">
In this paper we describe the Catalan Lexical Sam-
ple task. This task was initially devised for evalu-
ating the role of unlabeled examples in supervised
and semi-supervised learning systems for WSD and
it is the counterpart of the Spanish Lexical Sample
task. It was coordinated also with other lexical sam-
ple tasks (Basque, English, Italian, Rumanian, and
Spanish) in order to share part of the target words.
Firstly, we describe the methodology followed
for developing the specific linguistic resources nec-
essary for the task: the MiniDir-Cat lexicon and
the MiniCors-Cat corpus. Secondly, we briefly de-
scribe the seven participant systems, the results ob-
tained, and a comparative evaluation between them.
All participant teams applied only pure supervised
learning algorithms.

2 The Catalan Lexicon: MiniDir-Cat
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998696454545455">
Catalan language participates for the first time in the
Senseval evaluation exercise. Due to the time con-
straints we had to reduce the initial expectations on
providing annotated corpora for up to 45 words to
the final 27 word set treated. We preferred to re-
duce the number of words, while maintaining the
quality in the dictionary development, corpus anno-
tation process, and number of examples per word.
These words belong to three syntactic categories:
10 nouns, 5 adjectives, and 12 verbs. The selec-
tion was made by choosing a subset of the Spanish
lexical sample task and trying to share around 10 of
the target words with Basque, English, Italian, and
Rumanian lexical sample tasks. See table 1 for a
complete list of the words.
We used the MiniDir-Cat dictionary as the lexi-
cal resource for corpus tagging, which is a dictio-
nary being developed by the CLiC research group1.
MiniDir-Cat was conceived specifically as a re-
source oriented to WSD tasks: we have emphasized
low granularity in order to avoid the overlapping
of senses usually present in many lexical sources.

Regarding the polysemy of the selected words, the
average number of senses per word is 5.37, corre-
sponding to 4.30 senses for the nouns subset, 6.83

The content of MiniDir-2.1 has been checked and
refined in order to guarantee not only its consistency
and coverage but also the quality of the gold stan-
dard. Each sense in Minidir-2.1 is linked to the
corresponding synset numbers in the semantic net
EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1999) (zero, one, or more
synsets per sense) and contains syntagmatic infor-
mation as collocates and examples extracted from
corporal. Every sense is organized in the nine fol-
lowing lexical fields: LEMMA, POS, SENSE, DEF-
INITION, EXAMPLES, SYNONYMS, ANTONYMS
(only in the case of adjectives), COLLOCATIONS,
and SYNSETS. See figure 1 for an example of one

per sentence). The context considered for each ex-
ample includes the paragraph in which the target
word occurs, plus the previous and the following
paragraphs. All the examples have been extracted
from the corpus of the ACN Catalan news agency,
which includes about 110,588 news (January 2000–
December 2003). This corpus has been tagged with
POS. Following MiniDir-2.1, those examples con-
taining the current word in a multiword expression
have been discarded.
For every word, a total of 300 examples have
been manually tagged by two independent expert
human annotators, though some of them had to be
discarded due to errors in the automatic POS tag-
ging and multiword filtering. In the cases of dis-
agreement a third lexicographer defined the defini-
tive sense tags. All the annotation process has been
assisted by a graphical Perl-Tk interface specifi-
cally designed for this task (in the framework of the
Meaning European research project), and a tagging
handbook for the annotators (Artigas et al., 2003).
The inter–annotator agreement achieved was very
high: 96.5% for nouns, 88.7% for adjectives, 92.1%
for verbs, 93.16% overall.
The initial goal was to obtain, for each word, at
least 75 examples plus 15 examples per sense. How-
ever, after the labeling of the 300 examples, senses
with less than 15 occurrences were simply discarded
from the Catalan datasets. See table 1, left numbers
in column ‘#senses’, for the final ambiguity rates.
We know that this is a quite controversial decision
that leads to a simplified setting. But we preferred to
maintain the proportions of the senses naturally ap-
pearing in the ACN corpus rather than trying to ar-
tificially find examples of low frequency senses by
mixing examples from many sources or by getting
them with specific predefined patterns. Thus, sys-
tems trained on the MiniCors-Cat corpus are only
intended to discriminate between the most impor-
tant word senses appearing in a general news cor-
pus.

4 Resources Provided to Participants
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932842105263">
Participants were provided with the complete
Minidir-Cat dictionary, a training set with 2/3 of the
labeled examples, a test set with 1/3 of the exam-
ples and a complementary large set of all the avail-
able unlabeled examples in the ACN corpus (with
a maximum of 2,472 extra examples for the adjec-
tive popular). Each example is provided with a non
null list of category-labels marked according to the
newspaper section labels (politics, sports, interna-
tional, etc.)3. Aiming at helping teams with few re-
sources on the Catalan language, all corpora were
tokenized, lemmatized and POS tagged, using the
Catalan linguistic processors developed at TALP–
CLiC4, and provided to participants.
Table 1 contains information about the sizes of
the datasets and the proportion of the most-frequent
sense for each word (MFC). This baseline classifier
obtains a high accuracy of 66.36% due to the small
number of senses considered.

5 The Participant Systems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999757428571429">
Five teams took part on the Catalan Lexical Sam-
ple task, presenting a total of seven systems. We
will refer to them as: IRST, SWAT-AB, SWAT-CP,
SWAT-CA, UNED, UMD, and Duluth-CLSS. All
of them are purely supervised machine learning ap-
proaches, so, unfortunately, none of them incorpo-
rates the knowledge from the unlabeled examples.
Most of these systems participated also in the Span-
ish lexical sample task, with almost identical con-
figurations.
Regarding the supervised learning approaches
applied, we find AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, vector–
based cosine similarity, and Decision Lists (SWAT
systems), Decision Trees (Duluth-CLSS), Support

Vector Machines (IRST), and a similarity method
based on co-occurrences (UNED). Some systems
used a combination of these basic learning algo-
rithms to produce the final WSD system. For in-
stance, Duluth-CLSS applies a bagging–based en-
semble of Decision Trees. SWAT-CP performs a
majority voting of Decision Lists, the cosine–based
vector model and the Bayesian classifier. SWAT-CA
combines, again by majority voting, the previous
three classifiers with the AdaBoost based SWAT-AB
system. The Duluth-CLSS system is a replica of the
one presented at the Senseval-2 English lexical sam-
ple task.
All teams used the POS and lemmatization pro-
vided by the organization, except Duluth-CLSS,
which only used raw lexical information. A few sys-
tems used also the category labels provided with the
examples. Apparently, none of them used the ex-
tra information in MiniDir (examples, collocations,
synonyms, WordNet links, etc.), nor syntactic infor-
mation. Thus, we think that there is room for sub-
stantial improvement in the feature set design. It is
worth mentioning that the IRST system makes use
of a kernel within the SVM framework, including
semantic information. See IRST system description
paper for more information.

6 Results and System Comparison

<bodyText confidence="0.999844789473684">
Table 2 presents the global results of all participant
systems, including the MFC baseline (most frequent
sense classifier), sorted by the combined F mea-
sure. The COMB row stands for a voted combina-
tion of the best systems (see last part of the section
for a description). As in the Spanish lexical sample
task the IRST system is the best performing one. In
this case it achieves a substantial improvement with
respect to the second system (SWAT-AB)5.
All systems obtained better results than the base-
line MFC classifier, with a best overall improvement
of 18.87 points (56.09% relative error reduction)6.
For the multiple systems presented by SWAT, the
combination of learning algorithms in the SWAT-
CP and SWAT-CA did not help improving the ac-
curacy of the basic AdaBoost–based system SWAT-
AB. It is also observed that the POS and Lemma
information used by most systems is relevant, since

Detailed results by groups of words are showed
in table 3. Word groups include part–of–speech, in-
tervals of the proportion of the most frequent sense
(%MFS), and intervals of the ratio: number of ex-
amples per sense (ExS). Each cell contains preci-
sion and recall. Bold face results correspond to
the best system in terms of the F score. Last col-
umn, -error, contains the best F improvement
over the baseline: absolute difference and error re-
duction(%).
As in many other previous WSD works, verbs are
significantly more difficult (16.67 improvement and
49.3% error reduction) than nouns (23.46, 65.6%).
The improvements obtained by all methods on
words with high MFC (more than 90%) is generally
low. This is not really surprising, since statistically–
based supervised ML algorithms have difficulties
at acquiring information about non-frequent senses.
Notice, however, the remarkable 44.9% error re-
duction obtained by SWAT-AB, the best system on
this subset. On the contrary, the gain obtained on
the lowest MFC words is really good (34.2 points
and 55.3% error reduction). This is a good prop-
erty of the Catalan dataset and the participant sys-
tems, which is not always observed in other empir-
ical studies using other WSD corpora. It is worth
noting that even better results were observed in the
Spanish lexical sample task.
Systems are quite different along word groups:
IRST is globally the best but not on the words
with highest (between 80% and 100%) an lowest
(less than 50%) MFC, in which SWAT-AB is bet-
ter. UNED and UMD are also very competitive on
nouns but overall results are penalized by the lower
performance on adjectives (specially UNED) and
verbs (specially UMD). Interestingly, IRST is the
best system addressing the words with few exam-
ples per sense, suggesting that SVM is a good al-
gorithm for training on small datasets, but loses this
advantage for the words with more examples.
All, these facts, open the avenue for further im-

provements on the Catalan dataset by combining the
outputs of the best performing systems, or by per-
forming a selection of the best at word level. As a
first approach, we conducted some simple experi-
ments on system combination by considering a vot-
ing scheme, in which each system votes and the ma-
jority sense is selected (ties are decided favoring the
best method prediction). From all possible sets, the
best combination of systems turned out to be: IRST,
SWAT-AB, and UNED. The resulting F measure is
86.86, 1.63 points higher than the best single sys-
tem (see table 2). This improvement comes mainly
from the better F performance on noun and verb
categories: from 87.63 to 90.11 and from 82.63 to
85.47, respectively.
Finally, see the agreement rates and the Kappa
statistic between each pair of systems in table
4. Due to space restrictions we have indexed the
systems by numbers: 1=MFC, 2=UMD, 3=IRST,
4=UNED, 5=D-CLSS, 6=SWAT-AB, 7=SWAT-CP,
and 8=SWAT-CA. The upper diagonal contains the
agreement ratios varying from 70.13% to 96.01%,
and the lower diagonal contains the corresponding
Kappa values, ranging from 0.67 and 0.95. It is
worth noting that the system relying on the simplest
feature set (Duluth-CLSS) obtains the most simi-
lar output to the most frequent sense classifier, and
that the combination-based systems SWAT-CP and
SWAT-CA generate almost the same output.
