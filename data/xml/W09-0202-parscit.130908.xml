In the recognition of words that are typical
of a specific language variety, the classic
keyword approach performs rather poorly.
We show how this keyword analysis can be
complemented with a word space model
constructed on the basis of two corpora:
one representative of the language variety
under investigation, and a reference cor-
pus. This combined approach is able to
recognize the markers of a language va-
riety as words that not only have a sig-
nificantly higher frequency as compared
to the reference corpus, but also a differ-
ent distribution. The application of word
space models moreover makes it possible
to automatically discover the lexical alter-
native to a specific marker in the reference
corpus.

Different varieties of the same language often
come with their lexical peculiarities. Some words
may be restricted to a specific register, while other
ones may have different meanings in different re-
gions. In corpus linguistics, the most straightfor-
ward way of finding such words that are typical
of one language variety is to compile a corpus of
that variety and compare it to a reference corpus
of another variety. The most obvious comparison
takes on the form of a keyword analysis, which
looks for the words that are significantly more fre-
quent in the one corpus as compared to the other
(Dunning, 1993; Scott, 1997; Rayson et al., 2004).
For the purposes of a language-variational study,
this classic keyword approach often does not suf-
fice, however. As Kilgarriff has argued, keyword
statistics are far too sensitive to high frequencies
or topical differences to be used in the study of vo-
cabulary differences (Kilgarriff, 2001). We there-
fore put forward an approach that combines key-
word statistics with distributional models of lex-
ical semantics, or word space models (Sahlgren,
2006; Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Pad´o and Lap-
ata, 2007; Peirsman, 2008). In this way, we not
only check whether two words have significantly
different frequencies in the two relevant language
varieties, but also to what degree their distribution
varies between the corpora.
In this paper, we will focus on the lexical dif-
ferences between two regional varieties of Dutch.
Dutch is interesting because it is the official lan-
guage of two neighbouring countries, Belgium and
the Netherlands. Between these two countries,
there exists a considerable amount of lexical vari-
ation (Speelman et al., 2006). There are words
much more frequently used in one of the two va-
rieties as well as terms that have a different mean-
ing in the two regions. We will call such words
markers of a specific lect — a general term for re-
giolects, dialects, or other language varieties that
are specific to a certain region, genre, etc. By con-
structing a word space model on the basis of two
corpora instead of one, we will show how the dis-
tributional approach to lexical semantics can aid
the recognition of such lectal variation.
In the next section, we will point out the weak-
nesses of the classic keyword approach, and show
how word space models can provide a solution. In
section 3, we will discuss how our approach recog-
nizes markers of a given lect. In section 4, we will
demonstrate how it can automatically find the al-
ternatives in the other language variety. Section 5
wraps up with conclusions and an outlook for fu-
ture research.

corpus (Dunning, 1993; Scott, 1997; Rayson et al.,
2004). This keyword approach has two important
weaknesses, however. First, it has been shown that
statistically significant differences in the relative
frequencies of a word may arise from high abso-
lute frequencies rather than real lexical variation
(Kilgarriff, 2001). Second, in the explicit com-
parison of two language varieties, the keyword ap-
proach offers no way of telling what word in the
reference corpus, if any, serves as the alternative
to an identified marker. Word space models offer
a solution to both of these problems.
We will present this solution on the basis of two
corpora of Dutch. The first is the Twente Nieuws
Corpus (TwNC), a 300 million word corpus of
Netherlandic Dutch newspaper articles from be-
tween 1999 and 2002. The second is a corpus of
Belgian Dutch we compiled ourselves, with the
goal of making it as comparable to the Twente
Nieuws Corpus as possible. With newspaper arti-
cles from six major Belgian newspapers from the
years 1999 to 2005, it totals over 1 billion word
tokens. Here we will work with a subset of this
corpus of around 200 million word tokens.

2.1 Keywords
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999865434782609">
As our starting point, we calculated the keywords
of the Belgian corpus with respect to the Nether-
landic corpus, both on the basis of a chi-square test
(with Yates’ continuity correction) (Scott, 1997)
and the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993). We
considered only words with a total frequency of
at least 200 that moreover occurred at least five
times in each of the five newspapers that make up
the Belgian corpus. This last restriction was im-
posed in order to exclude idiosyncratic language
use in any of those newspapers. The top ten re-
sulting keywords, listed in Table 1, show an over-
lap of 90% between the tests. The words fall into
a number of distinct groups. Frank, Vlaams, Bel-
gisch and Antwerps (this last word appears only in
the x2 top ten) indeed typically occur in Belgian
Dutch, simply because they are so tightly con-
nected with Belgian culture. Dossier may reflect
a Belgian preference for this French loanword.
Why the words meer, veel, vrijdag, toekomst and
ziekenhuis (only in the log-likelihood top ten) are
in the lists, however, is harder to explain. There
does not appear to be a linguistically significant
difference in use between the two language va-
rieties, neither in frequency nor in sense. The
presence of foto, finally, may reflect certain pub-
lishing habits of Belgian newspapers, but again,
there is no obvious difference in use between Bel-
gium and the Netherlands. In sum, these Belgian
keywords illustrate the weakness of this approach
in the modelling of lexical differences between
two language varieties. This problem was already
noted by Kilgarriff (2001), who argues that “[t]he
LOB-Brown differences cannot in general be in-
terpreted as British-American differences”. One
of the reasons is that “for very common words,
high x2 values are associated with the sheer quan-
tity of evidence and are not necessarily associated
with a pre-theoretical notion of distinctiveness”.
One way to solve this issue is presented by Speel-
man et al. (2008). In their so-called stable lexical
markers analysis, the word frequencies in one cor-
pus are compared to those in several reference cor-
pora. The keyness of a word then corresponds to
the number of times it appears in the resulting key-
word lists of the first corpus. This repetitive test

helps filter out spurious keywords whose statistical
significance does not reflect a linguistically signif-
icant difference in frequency. Here we explore an
alternative solution, which scores candidate mark-
ers on the basis of their contextual distribution in
the two corpora, in a so-called bilectal word space.

Word space models (Sahlgren, 2006; Bullinaria
and Levy, 2007; Pad´o and Lapata, 2007; Peirsman,
2008) capture the semantic similarity between two
words on the basis of their distribution in a cor-
pus. In these models, two words are similar when
they often occur with the same context words, or
when they tend to appear in the same syntactic re-
lationships. For our purposes, we need to build a
word space on the basis of two corpora, more or
less in the vein of Rapp’s (1999) method for the
identification of translation equivalents. The main
difference is that we use two corpora of the same
language, each of which should be representative
of one of the language varieties under investiga-
tion. All other variables should be kept as constant
as possible, so that we can attribute differences in
word use between the two corpora to lexical dif-
ferences between the two lects. Next, we select
the words that occur in both corpora (or a subset
of the n most frequent words to reduce dimension-
ality) as the dimensions of the word space model.
For each target word, we then build two context
vectors, one for each corpus. These context vec-
tors contain information about the distribution of
the target word. We finally calculate the similarity
between two context vectors as the cosine of the
angle between them.
One crucial parameter in the construction of
word space models is their definition of distribu-
tion. Some models consider the syntactic relation-
ships in which a target word takes part (Pad´o and
Lapata, 2007), while other approaches look at the
collocation strength between a target and all of the
words that occur within n words to its left and
right (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007). With these last
word-based approaches, it has been shown that
small context sizes in particular lead to good mod-
els of the semantic similarity between two words
(Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Peirsman, 2008). So
far, we have therefore performed experiments with
context sizes of one, two and three words to the
left and right of the target. These all gave very sim-
ilar results. Experiments with other context sizes
and with syntactic features will be carried out in
the near future. In this paper, we report on the
results of a word-based model with context size
three.
In order to identify the markers of Belgian
Dutch, we start from the keyword lists above. For
each of the keywords, we get their context vector
from the Belgian corpus, and find the 100 most
similar context vectors from the Netherlandic cor-
pus. The words that correspond to these context
vectors are called the ‘nearest neighbours’ to the
keyword. In the construction of our word space
model, we selected from both corpora the 4,000
most frequent words, and used the cross-section
of 2,538 words as our set of dimensions or context
features. The model then calculated the point-wise
mutual information between the target and each
of the 2,538 context words that occurred at least
twice in its context. All words in the Netherlandic
Dutch corpus with a frequency of at least 200, plus
the target itself, were considered possible nearest
neighbours to the target.
Generally, where there are no major differences
in the use of a keyword between the two lects,
it will have itself as its nearest neighbour. If
this is not the case, this may identify the key-
word as a marker of Belgian Dutch. For exam-
ple, six words from the lists above have them-
selves as their nearest neighbour: meer, foto, veel,
vrijdag, toekomst and ziekenhuis. These are in-
deed the keywords that made little sense from a
language-variational perspective. Dossier is its
own second nearest neighbour, which indicates
that there is slightly less of a match between its
Belgian and Netherlandic use. Finally, the words
linked to Belgian culture —frank, Vlaams, Bel-
gisch and Antwerps — are much lower in their
own lists of nearest neighbours, or totally absent,
which correctly identifies them as markers of Bel-
gian Dutch. In short, the keyword analysis ensures
that the word occurs much more frequently in Bel-
gian Dutch than in Netherlandic Dutch; the word
space approach checks if it also has a different dis-
tribution in the two corpora.
For markers of Belgian Dutch, we can interpret
the nearest neighbour suggested by the system as
the other variety’s alternative to that marker. For
instance, dossier has rapport as its nearest neigh-
bour, a synonym which indeed has a high keyword
value for our Netherlandic Dutch corpus. Simi-
larly, the culture-related words have their Dutch

equivalents as their distributionally most simi-
lar words: frank has gulden (‘guilder’), Vlaams
and Belgisch both have Nederlands (‘Dutch’), and
Antwerps has Amsterdams (‘Amsterdam (adj.)’).
This makes intuitive sense if we take meaning to
be a relative concept, where for instance a con-
cept like ‘currency of this country’ is instantiated
by the franc in Belgium and the guilder in Holland
— at least in the pre-Euro period. These findings
suggest that our combined method can be applied
more generally in order to automatically discover
lexical differences between the two language vari-
eties.

3 Recognizing lectal differences
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985361111111">
First we want to investigate whether a bilectal
word space model can indeed contribute to the cor-
rect identification of markers of Belgian Dutch on
a larger scale. We therefore had both types of
approaches — the simple keyword approach and
the combined method — suggest a top 2,000 of
possible markers on the basis of our two corpora.
The combined approach uses the same word space
method we described above, with 2,538 dimen-
sions and a context size of three. Basing itself
on the lists of nearest neighbours, it then reorders
the list of keywords, so as to arrive at a ranking
that reflects lectal variation better than the original
one. To this goal, each keyword receives a new
score, which is the multiplication of two individ-
ual numbers. The first number is its rank in the
original keyword list. At this point we considered
only the 5,000 highest scoring keywords. The sec-
ond is based on a list that ranks the words accord-
ing to their difference in distribution between the
two corpora. Words that do not occur in their own
list of 100 nearest neighbours appear at the top of
the list (rank 1), followed by words that are their
own 100th nearest neighbour (rank 2), and so on
to the words that have themselves as nearest neigh-
bour (rank 101). In the future we plan to consider
different numbers of neighbours in order to pun-
ish words with very different distributions more
or less heavily. At this stage, however, restrict-
ing the method to 100 nearest neighbours gives
fine results. These two ranks are then multiplied
to give a combined score, on the basis of which a
final list of candidates for lectal variation is com-
puted. The lower this combined score (reflecting
either high keyword values, very different distri-
butions in the two corpora, or both), the higher

the likelihood that the word is a marker of Belgian
Dutch. This approach thus ensures that words that
have very different distributions in the two corpora
are promoted with respect to the original keyword
list, while words with very similar distributions are
downgraded.
As our Gold Standard we used the Reference
List of Belgian Dutch (Referentiebestand Belgisch
Nederlands, RBBN), a list of almost 4,000 words
and expressions that are typical of Belgian Dutch
(Martin, 2005). These are classified into a number
of groups — culturally-related terms (e.g., names
of political parties), Belgian markers that are not
lexicalized in Netherlandic Dutch, markers that
are lexicalized in Netherlandic Dutch, etc. We
used a subset of 717 one-word nouns, verbs and
adjectives that appear at least 200 times in our
Belgian corpus to evaluate our approach. Even
if we informally explore the first ten candidate
markers, the advantages of combining the log-
likelihood ratio with the word space model already
become clear (see table 2). Four of these candi-
dates are in the RBBN gold standard. Similarly,
frank, Vlaams and fr. are culturally related to Bel-
gium, while match has been identified as a typ-
ically Belgian word in previous corpus-linguistic
research (Geeraerts et al., 1999). Info and week-
end are not present in the external sources we con-
sulted, but nevertheless show an interesting distri-
bution with respect to their respective synonyms.
In the Belgian corpus, info occurs more often than
the longer and more formal information (32,009
vs 30,171), whereas in the Dutch corpus the latter
is used about 25 times as frequently as the former
(1,681 vs 41,429). Similarly, the Belgian corpus

contains far more instances of weekend than of
its synonym weekeinde (35,406 vs 6,390), while
the Dutch corpus shows the reverse pattern (6,974
vs 28,234). These words are thus far better can-
didate markers than the original keywords meer,
foto, veel, vrijdag, toekomst or ziekenhuis, which
have disappeared from the top ten.
Let us now evaluate the methods more broadly,
on the basis of the top 2,000 keywords they sug-
gest. The left plot in Figure 1 shows their F-scores
in function of the number of suggested markers;
the right graph plots precision in function of re-
call. The two keyword approaches score rather
similarly, with the log-likelihood ratio achieving
slightly better results than the chi-square test. This
superiority of the log-likelihood approach was al-
ready noted by Rayson et al. (2004). Both com-
bined methods give a very clear advantage over the
simple keyword statistics, again with the best re-
sults for the log-likelihood ratio. For example, ten
of the first 100 candidates suggested by both key-
word approaches are present in our Gold Standard,
giving a precision of 10% and a recall of 1.4% (F-
score 2.4%). Adding our word space model makes
this figure rise to 29 correct markers, resulting in
a precision of 29% and a recall of 4% (F-score
7.1%). This large advantage in performance is
maintained further down the list. At 1000 can-
didates, the keyword approaches have a recall of
around 20% (chi-square 19%, log-likelihood 21%)
and a precision of around 14% (chi-square 14%,
log-likelihood 15%). At the same point, the com-
bined approaches have reached a recall of over
30% (chi-square 31%, log-likelihood 32%) with
a precision of around 22% (chi-square 22%, log-
likelihood 23%). Expressed differently, the best
keyword approach needs around 500 candidates
to recover 10% of the gold standard, 1000 to re-
cover 20% and 2000 to recover 40%. This linear
increase is outperformed by the best combined ap-
proach, which needs only 300, 600 and 1500 can-
didate markers to reach the same recall figures.
This corresponds to relative gains of 40%, 40%
and 25%. As these results indicate, the perfor-
mance gain starts to diminish after 1000 candi-
dates. Future experiments will help determine if
this issue can be resolved with different parameter
settings.
Despite these large gains in performance, the
combined method still has problems with a num-
ber of Belgian markers. A manual analysis of
these cases shows that they often have several
senses, only one of which is typical of Belgian
Dutch. The Reference List for instance contains
fout (‘mistake’) and mossel (‘mussel’) as Belgian
markers, with their specialized meanings ‘foul (in
sports)’ and ‘weakling’. Not only do these words
have very low keyword values for the Belgian cor-
pus; they also have very similar distributions in
the two corpora, and are their own first and sec-
ond neighbour, respectively. Sometimes a fail-
ure to recognize a particular marker is more due

to the results of one individual method. This
is for instance the case with the correct Belgian
marker home (‘(old people’s) home’). Although
the word space model does not find this word in its
own list of nearest Netherlandic neighbours, it re-
mains low on the marker list due to its fairly small
log-likelihood ratio. Conversely, punt, graad and
klaar are rather high on the keyword list of the
Belgian corpus, but are downgraded, as they have
themselves as their nearest neighbour. This is
again because their status as a marker only applies
to one infrequent meaning (‘school mark’, ‘two-
year cycle of primary education’ and ‘clear’) in-
stead of the dominant meanings (‘final stop, point
(e.g., in sports)’, ‘degree’ and ‘ready’), which are
shared between the two regional varieties. How-
ever, this last disadvantage applies to all markers
that are much more frequently used in Belgium but
still sometimes occur in the Netherlandic corpus
with a similar distribution.
Finally, because our Gold Standard is not an
exhaustive list of Belgian Dutch markers, the re-
sults in Figure 1 are an underestimate of real per-
formance. We therefore manually went through
the top 500 markers suggested by the best com-
bined approach and classified them into three new
groups. The results of this analysis are pre-
sented in Table 3. First, we consulted the Van
Dale Groot Woordenboek der Nederlandse taal
(Den Boon and Geeraerts, 2005), the major dictio-
nary of Dutch, which contains about 3,000 words
marked with the label “Belgian Dutch”. 11% of
the first 100 and 9.4% of the first 500 candidates
that were initially judged incorrect carry this label
or have a definition that explicitly refers to Bel-
gium. Second, we counted the words that are mor-
phologically related to words in the Gold Standard
or to Belgian words found in Van Dale. These are
for instance compound nouns one of whose parts
is present in the Gold Standard, which means that

they are correct markers of Belgian Dutch as well.
They represent 2% of the top 100 and 4.6% of the
top 500. Third, we counted the words that are in-
herently linked to Belgian culture, mostly in the
form of place names. This group corresponds to
25% of the first 100 and 12% of the first 500 can-
didate markers. This suggests that the true preci-
sion of our method at 100 and 500 candidates is
thus at least 67% and 51.4%, respectively.

4 Finding alternatives

<bodyText confidence="0.999903388888889">
The Reference List of Belgian Dutch not only
lists Belgian Dutch words and expressions, but
also gives their Netherlandic Dutch alternative, if
one exists. Our word space model offers us a
promising way of determining this alternative au-
tomatically, by looking at the nearest Netherlandic
neighbours to a Belgian marker. As our Gold Stan-
dard, we selected from the Reference List those
words with a frequency of at least 200 in the Bel-
gian corpus whose Dutch alternative also had a
frequency of at least 200 in the Dutch corpus. This
resulted in a test set of 315 words: 240 nouns,
45 verbs and 30 adjectives. For each of these
words, we used our word space model to find the
100 nearest Netherlandic neighbours, again with
context size three but now with as dimensions all

Dutch alternative was indeed in the list of nearest
neighbours to the target. We started by looking
at the single nearest neighbour only, and then step
by step extended the list to include the 100 nearest
neighbours. If a word had itself among its nearest
neighbours, this neighbour was discarded and re-
placed by the next one down the list. The results
are shown in Figure 2. 11 out of 30 adjectives
(36.7%), 10 out of 45 verbs (22.2%) and 56 out
of 240 nouns (23.3%) had their Dutch alternative
as their nearest neighbour. At ten nearest neigh-
bours, these figures had risen to 60.0%, 48.9%
and 44.6%. These encouraging results underpin
the usefulness of word space models in language-
variational research.
A manual analysis of Belgian markers for which
the approach does not find the Netherlandic alter-
native again reveals that a large majority of these
errors occur when polysemous words have only
one, infrequent meaning that is typical of Bel-
gian Dutch. For example, the dominant sense
of the word tenor is obviously the ‘male singer’
meaning. In Belgium, however, this term can
also refer to a leading figure, for instance in a
political party or a sports discipline. Since this
metaphorical sense is far less frequent than the lit-
eral one, the context vector fails to pick it up, and
almost all nearest Netherlandic neighbours are re-
lated to opera or music. One way to solve this
problem would be to abandon word space models
that build only one context vector per word. In-
stead, we could cluster all individual contexts of a
word, with the aim of identifying context clusters
that correspond to the several senses of that word
(Sch¨utze, 1998). This is outside the scope of the
current paper, however.

5 Conclusions and future research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999998320754717">
We have presented an application of word space
models to language-variational research. To our
knowledge, the construction of word space mod-
els on the basis of two corpora of the same lan-
guage instead of one is new to both variational
linguistics and Natural Language Processing. It
complements the classic keyword approach in that
it helps recognize those keywords that, in addition
to their different relative frequencies in two lan-
guage varieties, also have a substantially different
distribution. An application of this method to Bel-
gian Dutch showed that the keywords that pass this
test indeed much more often represent markers of
the language variety under investigation. More-
over, often the word space model also succeeded
in identifying the Netherlandic Dutch alternative
to the Belgian marker.
As the development of this approach is still in its
early stages, we have committed ourselves more
to its general presentation than to the precise pa-
rameter settings. In the near future, we therefore
aim to investigate more fully the possible varia-
tion that the method allows. First, we will focus
on the implementation of the word space model,
by studying word-based models with other context
sizes as well as syntax-based approaches. Sec-
ond, we want to examine other ways in which
the word-based model and the classic keyword ap-
proach can be combined, apart from the multipli-
cation of ranks that we have proposed here. While
this large freedom in parameter settings could be
seen as a weakness of the proposed method, the
fact that we obtained similar results for all settings
we have tried out so far, adds to our confidence
that word space models present a sensible com-
plementation of the classic keyword approaches,
irrespective of the precise parameter settings.
In addition to those modelling issues, there are
a number of other extensions we would like to ex-
plore. First, the Gold Standard we have used so
far is rather limited in scope. We therefore plan
to incorporate more sources on language variation
to test the robustness of our approach. Finally, as
we have observed a number of times, the method
in its present form is not sensitive to possibly in-
frequent meanings of a polysemous word. This
may be solved by the application of a clustering
approach that is able to cluster a word’s contexts
into several sense clusters (Sch¨utze, 1998). Still,
the promising results in this paper encourage us to
believe that the current approach has a future as a
new method in language-variational research and
as a tool for lexicography.

We show how this keyword analysis can be complemented with a word space model constructed on the basis of two corpora: one representative of the language variety under investigation, and a reference corpus. This combined approach is able to recognize the markers of a language variety as words that not only have a significantly higher frequency as compared to the reference corpus, but also a different distribution. The application of word space models moreover makes it possible to automatically discover the lexical alternative to a specific marker in the reference corpus.</abstract>

For the purposes of a language-variational study, this classic keyword approach often does not suffice, however. As Kilgarriff has argued, keyword statistics are far too sensitive to high frequencies or topical differences to be used in the study of vocabulary differences (Kilgarriff, 2001). We therefore put forward an approach that combines keyword statistics with distributional models of lexical semantics, or word space models (Sahlgren, 2006; Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Pad´o and Lapata, 2007; Peirsman, 2008). In this way, we not only check whether two words have significantly different frequencies in the two relevant language varieties, but also to what degree their distribution varies between the corpora. In this paper, we will focus on the lexical differences between two regional varieties of Dutch. Dutch is interesting because it is the official language of two neighbouring countries, Belgium and the Netherlands. Between these two countries, there exists a considerable amount of lexical variation (Speelman et al., 2006). There are words much more freque</context>

The keyness of a word then corresponds to the number of times it appears in the resulting keyword lists of the first corpus. This repetitive test 10 helps filter out spurious keywords whose statistical significance does not reflect a linguistically significant difference in frequency. Here we explore an alternative solution, which scores candidate markers on the basis of their contextual distribution in the two corpora, in a so-called bilectal word space. 2.2 Bilectal Word Spaces Word space models (Sahlgren, 2006; Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Pad´o and Lapata, 2007; Peirsman, 2008) capture the semantic similarity between two words on the basis of their distribution in a corpus. In these models, two words are similar when they often occur with the same context words, or when they tend to appear in the same syntactic relationships. For our purposes, we need to build a word space on the basis of two corpora, more or less in the vein of Rapp’s (1999) method for the identification of translation equivalents. The main difference is that we use two corpora of the same language, each of which should be representative of one of the langua</context>
<context position="10225" citStr="Bullinaria and Levy, 2007" startWordPosition="1646" endWordPosition="1649">, we then build two context vectors, one for each corpus. These context vectors contain information about the distribution of the target word. We finally calculate the similarity between two context vectors as the cosine of the angle between them. One crucial parameter in the construction of word space models is their definition of distribution. Some models consider the syntactic relationships in which a target word takes part (Pad´o and Lapata, 2007), while other approaches look at the collocation strength between a target and all of the words that occur within n words to its left and right (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007). With these last word-based approaches, it has been shown that small context sizes in particular lead to good models of the semantic similarity between two words (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Peirsman, 2008). So far, we have therefore performed experiments with context sizes of one, two and three words to the left and right of the target. These all gave very similar results. Experiments with other context sizes and with syntactic features will be carried out in the near future. In this paper, we report on the results of a word-based model with context size three.

Some words may be restricted to a specific register, while other ones may have different meanings in different regions. In corpus linguistics, the most straightforward way of finding such words that are typical of one language variety is to compile a corpus of that variety and compare it to a reference corpus of another variety. The most obvious comparison takes on the form of a keyword analysis, which looks for the words that are significantly more frequent in the one corpus as compared to the other (Dunning, 1993; Scott, 1997; Rayson et al., 2004). For the purposes of a language-variational study, this classic keyword approach often does not suffice, however.

This keyword approach has two important weaknesses, however. First, it has been shown that statistically significant differences in the relative frequencies of a word may arise from high absolute frequencies rather than real lexical variation (Kilgarriff, 2001). Second, in the explicit comparison of two language varieties, the keyword approach offers no way of telling what word in the reference corpus, if any, serves as the alternative to an identified marker.

With newspaper articles from six major Belgian newspapers from the years 1999 to 2005, it totals over 1 billion word tokens. Here we will work with a subset of this corpus of around 200 million word tokens. 2.1 Keywords As our starting point, we calculated the keywords of the Belgian corpus with respect to the Netherlandic corpus, both on the basis of a chi-square test (with Yates’ continuity correction) (Scott, 1997) and the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993). We considered only words with a total frequency of at least 200 that moreover occurred at least five times in each of the five newspapers that make up the Belgian corpus. This last restriction was imposed in order to exclude idiosyncratic language use in any of those newspapers. The top ten resulting keywords, listed in Table 1, show an overlap of 90% between the tests. The words fall into a number of distinct groups. Frank, Vlaams, Belgisch and Antwerps (this last word appears only in the x2 top ten) indeed typically occur in Belgian Dutch, simply because they are so tightly connected with </context>

There does not appear to be a linguistically significant difference in use between the two language varieties, neither in frequency nor in sense. The presence of foto, finally, may reflect certain publishing habits of Belgian newspapers, but again, there is no obvious difference in use between Belgium and the Netherlands. In sum, these Belgian keywords illustrate the weakness of this approach in the modelling of lexical differences between two language varieties. This problem was already noted by Kilgarriff (2001), who argues that “[t]he LOB-Brown differences cannot in general be interpreted as British-American differences”. One of the reasons is that “for very common words, high x2 values are associated with the sheer quantity of evidence and are not necessarily associated with a pre-theoretical notion of distinctiveness”. One way to solve this issue is presented by Speelman et al. (2008). In their so-called stable lexical markers analysis, the word frequencies in one corpus are compared to those in several reference corpora.

The keyness of a word then corresponds to the number of times it appears in the resulting keyword lists of the first corpus. This repetitive test 10 helps filter out spurious keywords whose statistical significance does not reflect a linguistically significant difference in frequency. Here we explore an alternative solution, which scores candidate markers on the basis of their contextual distribution in the two corpora, in a so-called bilectal word space. 2.2 Bilectal Word Spaces Word space models (Sahlgren, 2006; Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Pad´o and Lapata, 2007; Peirsman, 2008) capture the semantic similarity between two words on the basis of their distribution in a corpus. In these models, two words are similar when they often occur with the same context words, or when they tend to appear in the same syntactic relationships. For our purposes, we need to build a word space on the basis of two corpora, more or less in the vein of Rapp’s (1999) method for the identification of translation equivalents. The main difference is that we use two corpora of the same language, each of which should be representative of one of the language varieties under investigation. All oth</context>

One crucial parameter in the construction of word space models is their definition of distribution. Some models consider the syntactic relationships in which a target word takes part (Pad´o and Lapata, 2007), while other approaches look at the collocation strength between a target and all of the words that occur within n words to its left and right (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007). With these last word-based approaches, it has been shown that small context sizes in particular lead to good models of the semantic similarity between two words (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Peirsman, 2008). So far, we have therefore performed experiments with context sizes of one, two and three words to the left and right of the target. These all gave very similar results. Experiments with other context sizes and with syntactic features will be carried out in the near future. In this paper, we report on the results of a word-based model with context size three. In order to identify the markers of Belgian Dutch, we start from the keyword lists above. For each of the keywords, we get their context vector from the Belgian corpus, and find the 100 most similar context vectors from the Netherlandic </context>

Some words may be restricted to a specific register, while other ones may have different meanings in different regions. In corpus linguistics, the most straightforward way of finding such words that are typical of one language variety is to compile a corpus of that variety and compare it to a reference corpus of another variety. The most obvious comparison takes on the form of a keyword analysis, which looks for the words that are significantly more frequent in the one corpus as compared to the other (Dunning, 1993; Scott, 1997; Rayson et al., 2004). For the purposes of a language-variational study, this classic keyword approach often does not suffice, however. As Kilgarriff has argued, keyword statistics are far too sensitive to high frequencies or topical differences to be used in the study of vocabulary differences (Kilgarriff, 2001). We therefore put forward an approach that combines keyword statistics with distributional models of lexical semantics, or word space models (Sahlgren, 2006; Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Pad´o and Lapata, 2007; Peirsman, 2008).

This keyword approach has two important weaknesses, however. First, it has been shown that statistically significant differences in the relative frequencies of a word may arise from high absolute frequencies rather than real lexical variation (Kilgarriff, 2001). Second, in the explicit comparison of two language varieties, the keyword approach offers no way of telling what word in the reference corpus, if any, serves as the alternative to an identified marker. Word space models offer a solution to both of these problems. We will present this solution on the basis of two corpora of Dutch. The</context>

Let us now evaluate the methods more broadly, on the basis of the top 2,000 keywords they suggest. The left plot in Figure 1 shows their F-scores in function of the number of suggested markers; the right graph plots precision in function of recall. The two keyword approaches score rather similarly, with the log-likelihood ratio achieving slightly better results than the chi-square test. This superiority of the log-likelihood approach was already noted by Rayson et al. (2004). Both combined methods give a very clear advantage over the simple keyword statistics, again with the best results for the log-likelihood ratio. For example, ten of the first 100 candidates suggested by both keyword approaches are present in our Gold Standard, giving a precision of 10% and a recall of 1.4% (Fscore 2.4%). Adding our word space model makes this figure rise to 29 correct markers, resulting in a precision of 29% and a recall of 4% (F-score 7.1%). This large advantage in performance is maintained further down the list. At 1000 candidates, the keyword approaches have a recall of ar</context>

The second is a corpus of Belgian Dutch we compiled ourselves, with the goal of making it as comparable to the Twente Nieuws Corpus as possible. With newspaper articles from six major Belgian newspapers from the years 1999 to 2005, it totals over 1 billion word tokens. Here we will work with a subset of this corpus of around 200 million word tokens. 2.1 Keywords As our starting point, we calculated the keywords of the Belgian corpus with respect to the Netherlandic corpus, both on the basis of a chi-square test (with Yates’ continuity correction) (Scott, 1997) and the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993). We considered only words with a total frequency of at least 200 that moreover occurred at least five times in each of the five newspapers that make up the Belgian corpus. This last restriction was imposed in order to exclude idiosyncratic language use in any of those newspapers. The top ten resulting keywords, listed in Table 1, show an overlap of 90% between the tests. The words fall into a number of distinct groups.

In sum, these Belgian keywords illustrate the weakness of this approach in the modelling of lexical differences between two language varieties. This problem was already noted by Kilgarriff (2001), who argues that “[t]he LOB-Brown differences cannot in general be interpreted as British-American differences”. One of the reasons is that “for very common words, high x2 values are associated with the sheer quantity of evidence and are not necessarily associated with a pre-theoretical notion of distinctiveness”. One way to solve this issue is presented by Speelman et al. (2008). In their so-called stable lexical markers analysis, the word frequencies in one corpus are compared to those in several reference corpora. The keyness of a word then corresponds to the number of times it appears in the resulting keyword lists of the first corpus. This repetitive test 10 helps filter out spurious keywords whose statistical significance does not reflect a linguistically significant difference in frequency.
