We present an approach to generating refer-
ring expressions in context utilizing feature se-
lection informed by psycholinguistic research.
Features suggested by studies on pronoun in-
terpretation were used to train a classifier sys-
tem which determined the most appropriate
selection from a list of possible references.
This application demonstrates one way to help
bridge the gap between computational and

This paper provides a system report on our submis-
sion for the GREC-MSR (Main Subject References)
Task, one of the two shared task competitions for
Generation Challenges 2009. The objective is to se-
lect the most appropriate reference to the main sub-
ject entity from a given list of alternatives. The cor-
pus consists of introductory sections from approxi-
mately 2,000 Wikipedia articles in which references
to the main subject have been annotated (Belz and
Varges, 2007). The training set contains articles
from the categories of cities, countries, mountains,
people, and rivers. The overall purpose is to develop
guidelines for natural language generation systems
to determine what forms of referential expressions
are most appropriate in a particular context.

<bodyText confidence="0.999974707317073">
The first step of our approach was to perform a lit-
erature survey of psycholinguistic research related
to the production of referring expressions by human
beings. Our intuition was that findings in this field
could be used to develop a useful set of features
with which to train a classifier system to perform the
GREC-MSR task. Several common factors govern-
ing the interpretation of pronouns were identified by
multiple authors (Arnold, 1998; Gordon and Hen-
drick, 1998). These included Subjecthood, Paral-
lelism, Recency, and Ambiguity. Following (McCoy
and Strube, 1999), we selected Recency as our start-
ing point and tracked the intervals between refer-
ences measured in sentences. Referring expressions
which were separated from the most recent reference
by more than two sentences were marked as long-
distance references. To cover the Subjecthood and
Parallelism factors, we extracted the syntactic cate-
gory of the current and three most recent references
directly from the GREC data. This information also
helped us determine if the entity was the subject of
the sentence at hand, as well as the two previous
sentences. Additionally, we tracked whether the en-
tity was in subject position of the sentence where
the previous reference appeared. Finally, we made
a simple attempt at recognizing potential interfering
antecedents (Siddharthan and Copestake, 2004) oc-
curring in the current sentence and the text since that
last reference.
Observing the performance of prototyping sys-
tems led us to include boolean features indicat-
ing whether the reference immediately followed the
words “and,” “but,” or “then,” or if it appeared be-
tween a comma and the word “and.” We also found
that non-annotated instances of the entity’s name,
which actually serve as references to the name itself
rather than to the entity, factor into Recency. Fig-
ure 1 provides an example of such a “non-referential
instance.” We added a feature to measure distance
to these items, similar to the distance between refer-
ences. Sentence and reference counters rounded out

3 System Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99977824">
A series of C5.0 decision trees (RuleQuest Research
Pty Ltd, 2008) were trained to determine the most
appropriate reference type for each instance in the
training set. Each tree used a slightly different sub-
set of features. It was determined that one decision
tree in particular performed the best on mountain
and person articles, and another tree on the remain-
ing categories. Both of these trees were incorporated
into the submitted system.
Our system first performed some preprocessing
for sentence segmentation and identified any non-
referential instances as described in Section 2. Next,
it marshalled all of the relevant data for the feature
set. These data points were used to represent the
context of the referring expression and were sent to
the decision trees to determine the most appropriate
reference type. Once the type had been selected, the
list of alternative referring expressions were scanned
using a few simple rules. For the first instance of a
name in an article, the longest non-emphatic name
was chosen. For subsequent instances, the shortest
non-emphatic name was selected. For the other 3
types, the first matching option in the list was used,
backing off to a pronoun or name if the preferred
type was not available.
