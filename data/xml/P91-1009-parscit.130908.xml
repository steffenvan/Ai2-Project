ABSTRACT&apos;
Certain pronoun contexts are argued to establish a
local center (LC), i.e., a conventionalized indexical
similar to lst/2nd pers. pronouns. Demonstrative
pronouns, also indexicals, are shown to access en-
tities that are not LCs because they lack discourse
relevance or because they are not yet in the uni-
verse of discourse.

Referring expressions in discourse are multifunc-
tional and dual-faced. Besides functioning to spec-
ify referents, they also indicate the status of their
referents in the evolving discourse model, such as
the informational status of being given or new
[Pri81], or maintain the attentional status of be-
ing in focus {Sid83} [Gro77]. They are dual-faced
in that the surface form of a referring expression
is constrained by the prior discourse context, and
then increments the context, serving to constrain
subsequent utterances [Isa75]. As a consequence
of this latter property, the communicative effect of
many referring forms, especially pronouns, is rel-
ative to specific types of discourse contexts. The
discourse reference functions of a few types of pro-
nouns are examined, taking into account their mul-
tifunctionality and their dual nature, in order to
clarify their processing requirements in dialogic
natural language systems. In particular, a compar-
ison of the conversational usage of it with two types
of indexical pronouns indicates that certain uses of
a, referred to as local centering, resemble what Ka-
plan [Kap89] refers to as pure indexicals. Several
functions of that are also identified and shown to
contrast with local centering with respect to their
preconditions and effects.
Third person, definite (3d) pronouns contrast
with indexical pronouns because the referents of
the former are arbitrary, and must be actively es-
tablished as part of the current universe of dis-
course in order for the intended referent to be

identified. In contrast, the referents of index-
icals such as I and you (i.e., the speaker and
addressee) are necessary components of the dis-
course circumstances.2 Indexical pronouns can
be further classified into pure indexicals versus
demonstratives,3 depending on how the current dis-
course circumstances provide their referents. The
referent of a pure indexical is fully determined by
the semantic rules and a context, which together
pick out a unique referent for each use. Thus I
refers to the person who utters it (assuming that I
is used to refer). A pure indexical cannot refer to
alternative entities, nor can any other expression
pick out the relevant entity via the same type of
referring function. Pure indexicals do not add en-
tities to a context, or change the attentional status
of their referents.
In contrast, the referent of a demonstrative pro-
noun is not completely determined by the context
plus the semantic rules. An accompanying demon-
stration is required, such as a physical or vocal
gesture to something in the immediate discourse
circumstances. Further, demonstratives can refer
to anything in the context that can be demon-
strated. In the cases of discourse deixis discussed by
Webber [VVeb90], e.g., demonstrative pronouns are
used to refer to discourse segments. Webber notes
that in these cases, the demonstration consists in
the intention to refer signalled by the use of the
demonstrative, plus the semantics of the contain-
ing clause, plus attentional constraints on which
discourse segments can be demonstrated.4 Thus,
3d pronouns, pure indexical pronouns, and demon-
stratives all differ with respect to the set of con-
textual elements that are available referents, and
the manner in which the referent is related to the
referring expression. Investigating their distinct
discourse functions leads to extensions to the tri-

2The term indexical includes devices whose meaning per-
tains to the time, the place and the perceived environment of
a discourse context, e.g., tense, deictic adverbs (here, there)
and deictic pronouns (this, that) [Pei35).
3The view of indexicals presented here is largely drawn
from Kaplan [Kap89].
&apos;Webber [Web90] argues that only segments on the right
frontier are available referents.

partite discourse model of attentional state, inten-
tional structure and segmental structure proposed
by Grosz and Sidner [GS86].5
The data presented here come from a set of dia-
logic interviews, originally described in [Sch85] (cf.
also [Pas89]). The methodology, fully described in
[Pas90], primarily involves the examination of lin-
guistic choices that are in principle independent,
but which are found to co-vary significantly of-
ten. Such co-variation is presumed to serve commu-
nicative functions that discourse processing models
need to replicate and explain. It should be remem-
bered that the patterns of co-variation described
here represent pragmatically significant usage pat-
terns, rather than obligatory ones.

In previous work, I presented the results of an anal-
ysis of the distribution of occurrences of it and
that having explicit antecedents in conversational
data from 4 interviews, involving 5 different speak-
ers (N = 678) [Pas89]. The two pronouns have
similar syntactic contexts of occurrence thus dif-
ferences in their distribution are pragmatic in na-
ture, and stem primarily from the semantic con-
trast of demonstrativity with non-demonstrativity.
Previously, I had noted that the data supported
the centering rule (CR) [GJW83] and the property
sharing principle (PSP) [Kam86]. A review of the
assumptions of the centering model, and of the con-
versational data, argues for an alternative view. In
this section I reinterpret the results as establishing
a distinct attentional state, local center. I explain
the two property sharing patterns of Kameyama&apos;s
PSP (subject and non-subject, [Kam86]) with re-
spect to local center, and discuss the similarity be-
tween local centers and pure indexicals. Finally, I
discuss the relation of local centering to intentional
and segmental structure.
According to the centering model, every utter-
ance has a backward-looking center-the currently
most salient entity, but it need not be overtly men-
tioned in the current utterance [GJW83]. The cen-
tering rule (CR) [GJW83], in combination with the
property-sharing principle (PSP) [Kam86], predict
certain preferred surface choices for maintaining
the backward-looking center (Cb). The CR says
that when the same Cb is maintained in a new ut-
terance, it is likely to be expressed by ,a (3d) pro-
noun [GJW83]. The PSP says that when 3d pro-
nouns realize the Cb in adjacent utterances, they

quency, expected frequency, and k-squares for each

reference)
should both be subjects (canonical center reten-
tion) or both not subjects (non-canonical center
retention) [Kam86]. Given that the Cb can poten-
tially be realized in non-preferred ways, that the
Cb may change, or that it may be unexpressed, Cb
has many possible surface realizations within a lo-
cal discourse context of two s-adjacent utterances.6
The distinct effects of alternate realizations of Cb
on segmental structure and intentional structure
have not been explored. Also, since the centering
model focusses on 3d pronouns, no claims are made
regarding the relation of indexical pronouns to the
discourse model.

predictive of lexical choice between it and that: the
form of the antecedent (FA), and the grammati-
cal role (GR) of both expressions. The best clas-
sifications were where FA had the three values—
pronominal antecedent (PRO), full NP antecedent
(NP), and other (OTH)—and where GR had the
two values—subject (SUB) and non-subject (non-
SUB). No other classifications of FA or GR were as
predictive.7 It is crucial to note that these classi-
fications were the minimal set that still preserved
the distinctiveness of the distributions. Seven other
surface features had previously been found to be
non-predictive [Sch85].8 Table 1 shows a very
strong correlation (p = .01%)9 between the form
and GR of the antecendent (N1) and the lexical
choice and GR of the co-specifying pronoun (N2).
Exactly 2 contexts selected for it, as shown by the
combination of the high cell x2s, and the low val-
ues for expected frequency, which together indi-
cate that the observed frequency was significantly
high. These 2 contexts were where the antecedent
was PRO and where both expressions maintained
the same GR value (cells 1, 7; PROGR, by itaR.)•
Of these 2, the more significant context, and in-
deed the most significant context in the whole ta-
ble, was where the antecedent was PROGR,„ (cell
x2 = 27.1). This is also the context type where
the demonstrative was predicted not to occur (i.e.,
where the antecedent was PROsuBJ; cells 2,4),
indicating a functional opposition between it and
that.1° Most of the cases of the PRO antecedents
consisted of occurrences of it (65%), indicating that
N1 and N2 often have the same form: it. Previ-
ously unreported data bear on the likelihood that
adjacent tokens of it will co-specify. An analy-
sis of all adjacent utterance pairs where each con-
tained at least one token of referential it revealed
that 30% were cases where both were subjects, of
which 90% co-specified. In contrast, it occurred
with opposing GR values 20% of the time, with
comparatively fewer instances where both tokens
co-specified (65%).
In sum, the data show that given ari occurrence
of it with an antecedent, the antecedent is likely

8Viz., speaker alternation, clause type (main or subor-
dinate), parallelism, and various measures of distance be-
tween pronoun and antecedent (e.g., intervening utterances,
intervening referents, syntactic depth). Note also that no
significant variation with respect to FA and GR was found
across individual speakers or conversations.

to be highly significant.

to be it, the GR of both expressions is likely to be
SUB, and in either case (SUB or non-SUB), they
will have the same GR value. The opposing GR
pattern is not predictive (where GR of N1 is not
the same as GR of N2). Nor is it predicted to oc-
cur with an antecedent NP, and is predicted not
to occur with an antecedent 0TH. The 2 contexts
singled out here indicate that it is a likely form for
re-referring to a known, given entity—because the
antecedent is PRO. Conversely, successive occur-
rences of it in Ui and Ui4.1 generally co-specify if
they have the same GR. The entity referred to by
it in these two patterns is called a local center. The
following local center establishment (LCE) rule en-
capsulates how a local center is anticipated and
maintained, both for discourse understanding (A)
and generation (B).
A: Recognizing a Local Center: Two s-
adjacent utterances U1 and U2 establish en-
tity E as a local center only if Ill contains a
3ds pronoun N1 referring to t, U2 contains
a co-specifying 3ds pronoun N2, and N1 and
N2 are both subjects or both non-subjects.
In the canonical case, both are subjects.
B: Generating a Local Center: To estab-
lish e as a local center in a pair of s-adjacent
utterances IJ1 and U2, use an expression of
type N to refer to E in both utterances where
each token, N1 and N2, is a 3ds pronoun, and
each is the subject of its clause or each is not
the subject of its clause. In the canonical
case, both should be subjects. (Precondition:
To establish an entity E as a local center, e
must be in the current focus space, and it
must be possible to refer to it with a 3ds pro-
noun.)
Recall from §1 that the process of interpreting
a pure index requires no search or inference, but
depends only on how the discourse circumstances
are currently construed. The semantic value of a
pure index is a contextual attribute—e.g., current
speaker—that must have a particular referential
value whenever an utterance occurs. In many ways,
a pronoun fulfilling the LC function is like a pure in-
dex. Discourse initially, there is no LC, because the
LCE rule depends minimally on an utterance pair.
But for any utterance pair where the LCE rule has
applied, there will be a discourse entity—a com-
ponent of the speech situation—that is by default
indexed to the use of subsequent referring expres-
sions with the right lexico-grammatical properties.
An LC conforms to the characteristics of a pure in-
dexical in that it becomes established as a transient
attribute of the speech situation analogous to the
essential attribute current speaker. The relation
of the referent to the referring expression is one-

to-one; no other referents are candidate LCs, and
no other form can access the LC. The processing
mechanism for interpreting subsequent expressions
conforming to the LCE rule is highly constrained.
It is analogous to, although not identical with, that
for pure indexicals. The difference is that the lo-
cal center is not lexicalized, but rather, must be
established and maintained by certain conventions
of usage. CPs can choose not to establish a LC, or
can choose not to maintain it.11
Kameyama [Kam86] proposed canonical and
non-canonical property sharing patterns, but did
not discuss what governs the choice between them.
Here it is suggested that the non-canonical LC pat-
tern, illustrated in 1), results from the interac-
tion of two distinct pragmatic effects. In the non-
canonical LC contexts, where the LC was realized
by non-SUB, the grammatical subjects were most
often 1st or 2nd person pronouns.12 This data con-
forms to an empirically supported proposal made
by Givon and others [Giv76] [Li76] that preferred
subjects are animate rather than inanimate, defi-
nite rather than indefinite, pronouns rather than
full NPs, and 1st or 2nd person rather than 3rd
person, due to the facts that in English, gram-
matical subjects often express discourse topics (cf.
also [FJ84]), that people prefer to talk about them-
selves and other people, and that discourse topics
are given. The interviews examined here were in-
tentionally biased towards the discussion of non-
animate entities.13 But Givon&apos;s subject hierarchy
predicts that, given a non-animate and an animate
entity in a single utterance, the latter will more of-
ten occur as the subject. Since every matrix-clause
utterance can have only one subject, there is po-
tential competition for the subject role. The data
show that when SUB, reserved by the LCE rule for
establishing a local center, is pre-empted by a 1st or
2nd person pronoun, it is still possible for LC to be
realized by alternate means, namely by sharing of
non-SUB. Thus the sharing of the GR value across
utterances is a defining characteristic, as noted by
Kameyama [Kam86]. The non-canonical LC con-
11 That CPs often do maintain an LC is borne out by data
pertaining to cohesive chains, a succession of utterance pairs
in which every utterance contains a co-specifying pronoun
token. There were 101 cohesive chains in the interview data,
ranging in length from 2 to 13 successive utterances, con-
taining 506 pronouns, the majority of which involved LC
contexts; cf. [Pas90].
12The two next most likely possibilities were an animate
full NP, or a non-referential pleonastic element, e.g., existen-
tial there. After that, there was a very small heterogeneous
category. Note: subject always refers to a surface grammat-
ical function.
13E.g., college courses, degree requirements, career op-
tions, resumes, and so on.
figuration results from an interaction between two
separate organizing forces: the LC status of the 3d
pronoun referent, and the attentional prominence
of the speaker and hearer.

In example 1), the utterance pair S2 and S3
share a 1st person subject and a non-canonical lo-
cal center.14 In this case, the centering model can-
not provide a principled answer to the question of
whether the speaker—the grammatical subject—
or the speaker&apos;s &apos;mental capacity&apos;—referred to by
successive 3d pronoun direct objects—is the cur-
rent center. In the model proposed here, S2 and S3
establish &apos;mental capacity&apos; as a local center, an at-
tentional status for regulating the generation and
production of 3ds pronouns, and the question of
which entity is more salient does not arise. But lo-
cal centering does seem to have a secondary func-
tion pertaining to the linkage between utterances
at the level of intentional and segmental structure.
In addition to sharing a default referent, clauses
containing LC pronouns are often semantically
alike in other ways. In an initial attempt to test
for this similarity, utterance pairs with PRO an-
tecedents were classified into those that did and
did not conform to the LCE rule. No other con-
texts were examined because contexts with 0TH
and NP antecedents were presumed to be even less
like LC contexts. These utterance pairs were sorted
into cases where the lexical root of the matrix verb
in both clauses was identical (i.e., the verb of which
the pronoun was an argument), but where the ut-
terances were not verbatim repetitions.15 The re-
sults were that 30% of the LC contexts had the
same verb, but only 11% of contexts differing from
LC in that N2 was that instead of iL None of
the contexts with opposing GR values for the two
pronouns had the same verb, which is not surpris-
ing given that for most verbs, each argument po-
sition has a very distinct semantic role. In sum,

the speaker continues to predicate the same type
of information about the same entity. This pre-
sumably serves as a cue that the speaker main-
tains a common Discourse Segment Purpose (DSP,
[GS86]) throughout both utterances—to convey in-
formation about the local center with respect to
the state of affairs conveyed by the verb. Insofar as
local centering pertains to segment continuation,
or to relating a new utterance to the DSP of a
preceding utterance, a discourse plan to continue
the current DSP need not refer directly to the sur-
face grammatical choices which reflect that plan,
but only to the current status of LC. If there is a
current LC, then maintaining it would reflect the
speaker&apos;s intention for the next utterance to con-
tinue the same DSP as the prior utterance.
The data assembled here indicate that local cen-
tering not only constrains the interpretation of cer-
tain pronouns, but also conveys the inter-utterance
relevance of locally centered entities in a larger dis-
course segment, or in the discourse as a whole.
However, most of the entities referred to in the con-
texts represented in Table I are not LCs. Logically,
that means they can fall into several classes: e.g.,
entities that are former or potential LCs because
they are in the universe of discourse and are rele-
vant to a former or future DSP; entities that are
in the universe of discourse but are not LCs be-
cause they are peripheral to the current DSP; and
finally, entities that are not yet in the universe of
discourse. The next section will illustrate how the
demonstrative picks out entities in the latter two
classes.

The results presented in the preceding section in--
dicate that referential it has different discourse ef-
fects, depending on its grammatical role, and on
various properties of its antecedent, which in turn
depend on the status of the referent in the discourse
context. Just as local centering is only one dis-
course referring function that it participates in, it
will be seen that there are several referring func-
tions the demonstrative participates in, each with
distinct preconditions and effects. Although pro-
nouns are often thought of as identifying topical

dent morphemes [BM871.16 In their analysis of
Chichewa, Bresnan and Mchombo argue that of
the two non-argument grammatical roles in LFG,
TOP(ic) and FOC(us), the independent pronouns
can only fill the FOC role, not TOP [BM87]. In
their framework, no expression can simultaneously
be TOP and FOC.17 This is reminiscent of the
pragmatic contrast in English between it and that
in focus-marking constructions, as illustrated in 2a-
b) below. That is acceptable, while it is not, as a
syntactically focussed element:

<bodyText confidence="0.99992636">
These examples are compatible with the conver-
sational data in the following way. If TOP and
FOC are truly contrastive grammatical functions,
the above examples show that that is more accept-
able as FOC. We have seen that it is less likely
when the antecedent is NP or 0TH than when it
is PRO, that it occurs often as SUB, and often
with SUB antecedents. Thus it, whether fullfill-
ing LC or not, correlates with other properties of
discourse topics. An entity that has been referred
to by an antecedent pronoun has already been lo-
cated in the universe of discourse, and already has
the informational status of given prior to the oc-
currence of the pronoun itself, and thus is a likely
topic. We have also seen that that is unlikely with
PROsuB antecedents, which would correlate with
a presumed likelihood for that to not express TOP.
But further evidence regarding the informational
and attentional status of the likely referents of that
reinforces the presumed TOP/FOC contrast.
The first case we&apos;ll look at involves NP an-
tecedents. Table 2 shows the distribution of an-
tecedent NPs, classifed according to whether they
were given or not, by lexical choice of it or that.

mentioned previously, if it was closely associated
with a previously mentioned entity (e.g., social
worker and the social work profession), or if it was
a commonly known individual entity whose iden-
tity would would be known to either speaker (e.g.,
places such as New York City). The very low prob-
ability for the )(2 of Table 2 (p = .01%) indicates
that the tendency for that to occur with new an-
tecedents and for it to occur with given antecedents
is extremely significant. Further classifying the lo-
cal utterance contexts by GR in various ways did
not reveal any further significant distinctions. This
result, while not counter-intuitive, is not one that
would be obvious without looking at frequency dis-
tributions in actual on-line discourse, since it can

new antecedent, or that with a given antecedent.

One way to interpret these results is that a single
reference to a new entity is insufficient to establish
the entity as part of the universe of discourse, given
the processing demands of actual on-line discourse.
In the cases where an entity is already given, but
is referred to by a full NP rather than a pronoun
(for whatever reason), the entity can be successfully
reinvoked in the immediately following utterance
by a 3ds pronoun. If the entity is new, a single prior
mention is not in general sufficient, with respect to
these data, to predispose the use of a 3ds pronoun
to reinvoke it. Instead, the demonstrative functions
to incorporate these new entities into the context.
The demonstrative has another singular func-
tion with NP antecedents. Table 1 singles out
2 significant contexts where there was a full NP

an NP there was an increased likelihood
for thatnonsuBJ
and a decreased likelihood for
itsuBJ. Because itsuBJ is the canonical indi-
cator of LC, and because LCs are presumed to
have discourse relevance (i.e., play a central role
in the current DSP), I hypothesized that the link-
age between an antecedent NPoS U BJ and a co-
specifying thatno served
nsu J to mark the referent
as being unlike a local center by being peripheral
to the current DSP. This was tested by examin-
ing how often an entity mentioned in the NP con-
texts was mentioned later in the discourse. Table
3 depicts the contexts in which an antecedent NP
was followed by it or that, where GR for each was
SUB or non-SUB, or where the GR values differed
(X). These 6 contexts were coded for whether the
referent was referred to again within the 10 utter-
ances following the utterance containing the pro-
noun. If so, the entity was coded as relevant; else
it was non-relevant. The low probability of 1.6%
indicates a significant correlation. The 2 cells con-
tributing the most to the overall significance were
for the NP
- non-suB/THATnon-suB context, with
non-relevant entities occurring significantly often,
and relevant entities occurring significantly rarely.
This evidence supports the view that the features
of this context function to re-invoke entities while
simultaneously signalling their peripheral status.
The final referring function discussed here is
where the demonstrative has an 0TH antecedent.
When N1 is OTHnonSUB (contexts 21-24), itsua
is unlikely (context 21), and both cases of thatsuB
(context 22) and thatnon-suB (context 24) are sig-
nificantly frequent. I will argue that these 0TH
contexts exemplify intra-textual deixis, which is
analogous to the cases of discourse deixis stud-
ied by Webber [Web90]. I refer to these cases
as intra-textual deixis because the deictic refer-
ence involves referents related to grammatical con-
stituents rather than to discourse segments.

In previous work, I pointed out that the criti-
cal feature of the antecedent type which favors the
lexical choice of that is syntactic, namely the dis-
tinction between NPs with lexical noun heads and
other types of constituents [Sch84]. Contexts where
N1 is an NP whose head is a derived nominaliza-
tion (such as the careful choice of one&apos;s words) pat-
tern like those where the head is a lexical noun.I8
Gerundives fall into the 0TH class. Unlike NPs,
the 0TH antecedents cannot be marked for def-
initeness: *a /*the carefully choosing one&apos;s words
versus a jthe careful choice of words. Definiteness
is one of the means for indicating whether a refer-
ent is presupposed to be part of the current context.
Thus a possible difference between the interpreta-
tion of the two types of phrases carefully choosing
one&apos;s words and a careful choice of words would
have to do with whether there is a discourse entity
in the context as a consequence of the occurrence
of the phrase itself.

C13: there are some books that we

C26: which I think is a great title (laugh)
C33: um but it talks very interestingly
Cay: about how to go about interviewing
C4: and that&apos;s that&apos;s going to be important
Another feature of 0TH antecedents pertains to
their ability to evoke specific entities into the uni-
verse of discourse. Compare the two pronouns in
example 5). The token of it in C2a unambiguously
refers to the one book called Sweaty Palms. The
referent of that in C4 is much harder to pin down.
Does it correspond to interviewing, or to how to
go about interviewing? This example illustrates an
inherent vagueness in the processing of finding a
textual referent for a demonstrative which I will
now describe in more detail.
Webber [Web90] notes that deictic reference is
inherently ambiguous, although I prefer the term
vague, in that vagueness connotes an underspeci-
fied interpretation that can be given a number of
more specific readings. Webber argues persuasively
that deictic reference to a discourse segment is re-
stricted to references to open segments on the right
frontier, but that there is still an ambiguity as to
which segment might be referred to, due to the
recursive nature of discourse segmentation. Since
an open segment on the right frontier may contain
18 Mixed norninals, such as the careful choosing of one&apos;s
words, occurred too rarely to have a discriminating effect on
contexts favoring it or that.
within it an embedded open segment that is also on
the right frontier, a token of the demonstrative that
refers to a discourse segment can be ambiguous be-
tween a more inclusive segment and a less inclusive
one [Web90]. The vagueness may be eliminated if
the context in which the deictic expression occurs
clearly selects one of the possible readings. This
phenomenon pertaining to deictic reference to seg-
ments is replicated in the cases where that has an
0TH antecedent, thus in C4 of 5), the antecedent of
the demonstrative pronoun could be interviewing,
or the more inclusive expression go about interview-
ing, or the more inclusive one yet how to go about
interviewing. I will now argue that such expres-
sions do not in and of themselves introduce entities
into the universe of discourse.

The examples in 6)-8) show that entities intro-
duced by referential NPs in U1 are still available
for pronominal reference in U3, after an intervening
U2. U1 introduces the referring expressions Carol
and her dresses. Example 6) shows that the refer-
ent of her dresses is still available in U3 even though
it is not mentioned in U2. Instead, U2 contains
a pronoun that refers to the fact that is asserted
by the whole utterance U1. In contrast, the refer-
ent of the non-nominal sentence constituent—Carol
insisted on sewing her dresses from non-synthetic
fabric—is not available after an intervening sen-
tence that contains a deictic reference to a differ-
ent non-nominal constituent, as in 7), or after an
intervening sentence that contains a reference to a
discourse entity mentioned in U1, as in 8).
The preceding examples show that 0TH con-
stituents do not introduce entities into the dis-
course context. With such antecedents, the demon-

strative does not access a pre-existing discourse en-
tity, but rather, plays a role in a referring function
by virtue of which a new discourse entity is added
to the context. The occurrence of the demonstra-
tive triggers a referring function that is constrained
by the semantics of the demonstrative pronoun
and its local semantic context, the antecedent, and
other contextual considerations. The result of ap-
plying an appropriate referring function is to in-
crement the context with the new discourse entity
that is found to be the referent of the demonstra-
tive pronoun.
This investigation has shown that a pronoun
does not achieve discourse reference in and of it-
self. In combination with various linguistic prop-
erties of the prior utterance, and depending on the
status of the referent in the context, a pronoun may
have distinct referring functions. Although this in-
vestigation has focussed primarily on non-animate
pronouns, future research is expected to show that
elements of the contrast between it and that oc-
cur with animate 3d pronouns (e.g., he, she) since
these pronouns have both demonstrative and non-
demonstrative uses.

The two pronouns have similar syntactic contexts of occurrence thus differences in their distribution are pragmatic in nature, and stem primarily from the semantic contrast of demonstrativity with non-demonstrativity. Previously, I had noted that the data supported the centering rule (CR) [GJW83] and the property sharing principle (PSP) [Kam86]. A review of the assumptions of the centering model, and of the conversational data, argues for an alternative view. In this section I reinterpret the results as establishing a distinct attentional state, local center. I explain the two property sharing patterns of Kameyama&apos;s PSP (subject and non-subject, [Kam86]) with respect to local center, and discuss the similarity between local centers and pure indexicals.

This presumably serves as a cue that the speaker maintains a common Discourse Segment Purpose (DSP, [GS86]) throughout both utterances—to convey information about the local center with respect to the state of affairs conveyed by the verb. Insofar as local centering pertains to segment continuation, or to relating a new utterance to the DSP of a preceding utterance, a discourse plan to continue the current DSP need not refer directly to the surface grammatical choices which reflect that plan, but only to the current status of LC.

The two pronouns have similar syntactic contexts of occurrence thus differences in their distribution are pragmatic in nature, and stem primarily from the semantic contrast of demonstrativity with non-demonstrativity. Previously, I had noted that the data supported the centering rule (CR) [GJW83] and the property sharing principle (PSP) [Kam86]. A review of the assumptions of the centering model, and of the conversational data, argues for an alternative view. In this section I reinterpret the results as establishing a distinct attentional state, local center. I explain the two property sharing patterns of Kameyama&apos;s PSP (subject and non-subject, [Kam86]) with respect to local center, and discuss the similarity between local centers and pure indexicals. Finally, I discuss the relation of local centering to intentional and segmental structure. According to the centering model, every utterance has a backward-looking center-the currentl</context>

Given that the Cb can potentially be realized in non-preferred ways, that the Cb may change, or that it may be unexpressed, Cb has many possible surface realizations within a local discourse context of two s-adjacent utterances.6 The distinct effects of alternate realizations of Cb on segmental structure and intentional structure have not been explored. Also, since the centering model focusses on 3d pronouns, no claims are made regarding the relation of indexical pronouns to the discourse model. The empirical results presented in [Pas89) showed that two features of the utterances containing </context>

The relation of the referent to the referring expression is one65 to-one; no other referents are candidate LCs, and no other form can access the LC. The processing mechanism for interpreting subsequent expressions conforming to the LCE rule is highly constrained. It is analogous to, although not identical with, that for pure indexicals. The difference is that the local center is not lexicalized, but rather, must be established and maintained by certain conventions of usage. CPs can choose not to establish a LC, or can choose not to maintain it.11 Kameyama [Kam86] proposed canonical and non-canonical property sharing patterns, but did not discuss what governs the choice between them. Here it is suggested that the non-canonical LC pattern, illustrated in 1), results from the interaction of two distinct pragmatic effects. In the noncanonical LC contexts, where the LC was realized by non-SUB, the grammatical subjects were most often 1st or 2nd person pronouns.12 This data conforms to an empirically supported proposal made by Givon and others [Giv76] [Li76] that preferred subjects are animate rather than inanimate, definite rather than indefinite, pronouns</context>

Since every matrix-clause utterance can have only one subject, there is potential competition for the subject role. The data show that when SUB, reserved by the LCE rule for establishing a local center, is pre-empted by a 1st or 2nd person pronoun, it is still possible for LC to be realized by alternate means, namely by sharing of non-SUB. Thus the sharing of the GR value across utterances is a defining characteristic, as noted by Kameyama [Kam86]. The non-canonical LC con11 That CPs often do maintain an LC is borne out by data pertaining to cohesive chains, a succession of utterance pairs in which every utterance contains a co-specifying pronoun token. There were 101 cohesive chains in the interview data, ranging in length from 2 to 13 successive utterances, containing 506 pronouns, the majority of which involved LC contexts; cf. [Pas90]. 12The two next most likely possibilities were an animate full NP, or a non-referential pleonastic element, e.g., existential there. After that, there was a very small heterogeneous category.

As a consequence of this latter property, the communicative effect of many referring forms, especially pronouns, is relative to specific types of discourse contexts. The discourse reference functions of a few types of pronouns are examined, taking into account their multifunctionality and their dual nature, in order to clarify their processing requirements in dialogic natural language systems. In particular, a comparison of the conversational usage of it with two types of indexical pronouns indicates that certain uses of a, referred to as local centering, resemble what Kaplan [Kap89] refers to as pure indexicals. Several functions of that are also identified and shown to contrast with local centering with respect to their preconditions and effects.

Demonstrative pronouns, also indexicals, are shown to access entities that are not LCs because they lack discourse relevance or because they are not yet in the universe of discourse. 1 Introduction Referring expressions in discourse are multifunctional and dual-faced. Besides functioning to specify referents, they also indicate the status of their referents in the evolving discourse model, such as the informational status of being given or new [Pri81], or maintain the attentional status of being in focus {Sid83} [Gro77]. They are dual-faced in that the surface form of a referring expression is constrained by the prior discourse context, and then increments the context, serving to constrain subsequent utterances [Isa75]. As a consequence of this latter property, the communicative effect of many referring forms, especially pronouns, is relative to specific types of discourse contexts.

The best classifications were where FA had the three values— pronominal antecedent (PRO), full NP antecedent (NP), and other (OTH)—and where GR had the two values—subject (SUB) and non-subject (nonSUB). No other classifications of FA or GR were as predictive.7 It is crucial to note that these classifications were the minimal set that still preserved the distinctiveness of the distributions. Seven other surface features had previously been found to be non-predictive [Sch85].8 Table 1 shows a very strong correlation (p = .01%)9 between the form and GR of the antecendent (N1) and the lexical choice and GR of the co-specifying pronoun (N2).

This example illustrates an inherent vagueness in the processing of finding a textual referent for a demonstrative which I will now describe in more detail. Webber [Web90] notes that deictic reference is inherently ambiguous, although I prefer the term vague, in that vagueness connotes an underspecified interpretation that can be given a number of more specific readings. Webber argues persuasively that deictic reference to a discourse segment is restricted to references to open segments on the right frontier, but that there is still an ambiguity as to which segment might be referred to, due to the recursive nature of discourse segmentation.
