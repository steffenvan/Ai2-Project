The notion of semantic roles is usually at-
tributed to Fillmore [8], however its history can
be traced back through Tesniere [16] to Panini.
Following this tradition, many researchers rec-
ognize their usefulness in the description of
language — even if they do not agree on their
significance [7]. However, a weak or strong
commitment to this notion does not elude the
fact that it proves to be very difficult to settle on
a finite set of labels along with their formal def-
initions. The dilemma resulting from this
challenge is well known: to require a univocal
identification by each role results in an increase
in their number while to abstract their semantic
content gives rise to an inconsistent set. If a fi-
nite set is possible, one has to find a proper
balance between these two extremes. As a result,
every flavor of roles have been used from time to
time in linguistics (e.g., GB, in the spirit of
Fillmore, HPSG, in the line of situation seman-
tics), and also in Al [10, see also 4].
Between the total refusal to use those labels
(as in GPSG) and the acceptance of individual
roles (as in HPSG) there is a wide range of pro-
posals on what constitute a good set of
L(inguistic)-Roles [7] and, as a consequence, on
the way to differentiate between them and define
them. Most of the definitions have been based on
the referential properties that can be associated
with each role bearer (e.g. an AGENT is a
volitional animate entity). Even if this approach
is necessary at one time or another, this kind of
definition inevitably leads to either the &amp;quot;let&apos;s
create another role&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;let&apos;s abstract its
definition&amp;quot; syndromes. Properties are not always
of the static kind though. Sometimes, dynamic
properties are also used (e.g. an AGENT is the
perceived instigator of the action).
Since one of the desired characteristic of a
roles system is the power to discriminate events
[5] (another &amp;quot;desired&amp;quot; property being to offer an
easier selection of grammatical functions), the
recognition of semantic roles should be linked to
the interpretation of the event, that is to their dy-
namic properties. In a study on locative verbs in
French, Boons [3] has convincingly shown the
importance of taking into account aspectual cri-
teria in the description of a process, suggesting
that GOAL and SOURCE roles should be reinvesti-
gated in the light of those criteria. It is our
hypothesis that proliferation of roles is a natural
phenomenon caused by the specialized proper-
ties required by the interpretation of a predicate
within a specific semantic field: to overlook
these properties yields the over-generalization
already mentionned. The best way to approach
the expansion/contraction dilemma is to search
for the minimal relations required for a dynamic
interpretation of events (in terms of their aspec-
tual criteria and through an identification of all
the participants in it).
Our first step toward this abstraction was to
consider each participant (individuals or
properties) either as a localized entity (a token)
or a location (a place), and to determine its role
in the realization of the process expressed by the
predicate. The model exhibits some common
points with a localist approach [1,11] since it
recognizes (in an abstract sense) the importance
of spatio-temporal &amp;quot;regions&amp;quot; in the process of
individuation of events [14]. To express the
change of localization (again in an abstract
sense), the notion of transitions is used. The
entire construction is inspired by Petri net theory
[15]: a set S of places, a set T of transitions, a
flow relation F: (S x T) --&gt; (TX S) and markers
are the categories used to define the structure of
a process (and as a consequence of the events
composing it).
For example, the dynamic representation of
Max embarque la caisse sur le cargo [3]/Max em-
barks the crate on the cargo boat can be analyzed
in two steps. First there is a transition from an
initial state Is where the crate is not on the cargo
boat to a final state FS where the crate is on the
cargo boat. The final state can be expressed by
the static passive, la caisse est embarquee sur le
cargo/the crate was embarked on the cargo boat,
and is schematized in (2). One of the argument
(cargo boat) is used as a localization while the
other argument is used as a localized entity
(crate), the THEME according to Gruber [9]. The
initial state can be expressed (in this case) by the
negation of the final state and is schematized in
(1). The realization of the entire process is then
represented by the firing of the net which can be
illustrated by the snapshots (1) and (2).
Is: 0-1-0 :FS 2. is:0-1-0 :FS
To integrate the participation of &amp;quot;Max&amp;quot; in
the model, we recognize the importance of

causality in the discrimination of events [13,14].
Since the cause is understood to be the first
entity responsible for the realization of events
[6], the obvious schematization is (3).

It is possible that a recursive definition
(places and transitions) will be necessary to ex-
press &amp;quot;properly&amp;quot; the causation, the localization
of events and processes or the concept of dy-
namic states [2,14]. In that case, the schematiza-
tion could then be (4). But we can achieve the
same result through a proper type definition of
the transition expressing the cause: (s x t) -+ (t x
((s x t) (t&lt; s))), where &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; is a place and &amp;quot;t&amp;quot;, a
transition.
This approach to semantic roles determina-
tion is close to the one undertook by Jackendoff
[12]. His identification of each role to a particu-
lar argument position in a conceptual relation is
given here by the way it participate to the firing
of the net. (It is our guess that most of the con-
ceptual relations used by Jackendoff can be
expressed within this model, giving to them an
operational interpretation.) The model has the
advantage to give an explicit and simple defini-
tion of relations that do not have the same
semantic range (e.g. CAUSE vs FROM vs AT).
The analysis of locative processes using
abstract regions instead of the traditional roles is
better because it is, we think, the real basis of
those interpretations. Abstracting away referen-
tial properties gives the basic interactions ex-
pressed by the predicate. Specifying those
properties within a specific semantic field gives
rise to the set of roles we are used to (e.g. within
the spatial field, schematizations (1) and (2)
express SOURCE and GOAL roles).
With this model we were able to give an
operational description of the difference between
Max charge des briques dans le camionlMax
loads bricks in the truck and Max charge le
camion de briquesIMax loads the truck with
bricks. The schematization take into account
which participant is responsible for each transi-
tion firing and thus can lead us to the &amp;quot;final&amp;quot;
place. As a first approximation of these continu-
ous processes, (5) and (6) are proposed (the
direct contribution of the instrument is also
introduced). But recognition, as a participant of
the quantity of bricks in (5) and the capacity of
the truck in (6), results in the schematizations (7)
et (8) (both display a specialization of their
direct object in order to complete the semantic
interpretation).

By its simplicity, the model can thus give
rise to &amp;quot;confusion&amp;quot; over some roles, in accor-
dance with the general tendancy to observe
&amp;quot;roles clusters&amp;quot;. The resulting notation seems
also an interesting way to explore the differences
between static and dynamic processes, differ-
ences that are not very &amp;quot;visual&amp;quot; if one is using a
static notation.
Our research is now directed toward the
analysis of the system when more semantic
content is used. We are testing if these adds-on
have impacts on its behaviour, while analyzing if
the partial semantic interpretation gives rise to
the predicted syntactic forms (that is how does
each potential participant is grammaticalized).

It is our hypothesis that proliferation of roles is a natural phenomenon caused by the specialized properties required by the i</context>

If a finite set is possible, one has to find a proper balance between these two extremes. As a result, every flavor of roles have been used from time to time in linguistics (e.g., GB, in the spirit of Fillmore, HPSG, in the line of situation semantics), and also in Al [10, see also 4]. Between the total refusal to use those labels (as in GPSG) and the acceptance of individual roles (as in HPSG) there is a wide range of proposals on what constitute a good set of L(inguistic)-Roles [7] and, as a consequence, on the way to differentiate between them and define them. Most of the definitions have been based on the referential properties that can be associated with each role bearer (e.g. an AGENT is a volitional animate entity). Even if this approach is necessary at one time or another, this kind of definition inevitably leads to either the &amp;quot;let&apos;s create another role&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;let&apos;s abstract its definition&amp;quot; syndromes. Properties are not always of the static kind though. Sometimes, dynamic properties are also used (e.g. an AGENT is the perceived instigator of the action). Since o</context>

The best way to approach the expansion/contraction dilemma is to search for the minimal relations required for a dynamic interpretation of events (in terms of their aspectual criteria and through an identification of all the participants in it). Our first step toward this abstraction was to consider each participant (individuals or properties) either as a localized entity (a token) or a location (a place), and to determine its role in the realization of the process expressed by the predicate. The model exhibits some common points with a localist approach [1,11] since it recognizes (in an abstract sense) the importance of spatio-temporal &amp;quot;regions&amp;quot; in the process of individuation of events [14]. To express the change of localization (again in an abstract sense), the notion of transitions is used.

(It is our guess that most of the conceptual relations used by Jackendoff can be expressed within this model, giving to them an operational interpretation.) The model has the advantage to give an explicit and simple definition of relations that do not have the same semantic range (e.g. CAUSE vs FROM vs AT).
