We refine and extend prior views of the descrip-
tion, purposes, and contexts-of-use of acknowledg-
ment acts through empirical examination of the
use of acknowledgments in task-based conversa-
tion. We distinguish three broad classes of ac-
knowledgments (other —ackn, selfother--■ackn,
and self+ackn) and present a catalogue of 13 pat-
terns within these classes that account for the spe-
cific uses of acknowledgment in the corpus.

1 MOTIVATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999895">
This study is motivated by the need for better di-
alogue models in spoken-language systems (SLSs).
Dialogue models contribute directly to the interac-
tion by providing inter-utterance coherence. Flu-
ent understanding and use of acknowledgments
should improve spoken-language systems in at
least the following ways:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992039363636364">
• Preventing miscommunication. Acknowledg-
ments are an important device for establishing
mutual knowledge and signaling comprehension.
Early detection and correction of cases of mis-
communication and misunderstanding should
prevent failure that would otherwise have been
even more catastrophic.
• Improved naturalness. Acknowledgments are a
prominent feature of human-human dialogue.
Supporting the use of acknowledgments for both
the system and the user will emphasize the &amp;quot;nat-
uralness&amp;quot; of interfaces and improve their utility.
• Dialogue control. Humans cope with dialogue
control (e.g., turn-taking) with seemingly little
or no effort. Acknowledgments form an intricate
relationship with dialogue control mechanisms.
Understanding these control mechanisms is cen-
tral to the development and success of spoken
language systems in order to &amp;quot;track&amp;quot; dialogues
and determine appropriate system actions.
• Improved recognition. To the extent that a di-
alogue model can narrow the range of possible

contexts for interpretation of a user&apos;s utterance,
a spoken-language system&apos;s speech recognition
performance will be improved (Young et al.,
1989).
We seek to refine and extend prior views of
the description, purposes, and contexts-of-use of
acknowledgment acts through empirical examina-
tion of the use of acknowledgments in task-based
conversation. In particular, we seek to describe
systematically (1) the communicative value of an
acknowledgment and (2) the circumstances of its
use. The scope of our inquiry involves spoken
interaction. We present a catalogue of types of
acknowledgment. This catalogue is based on a
process model of acknowledgment that explains
instances of these acts in a corpus of task-based
conversations.

Clark and Schaefer (1989) suggested that acknowl-
edgments are an important component of a larger
framework through which communicating parties
provide evidence of understanding. Conversants
have a range of means, which vary with respect
to strength, for indicating acceptance of a presen-
tation. These include continued attention, initi-
ation of the next relevant contribution, acknowl-
edgment, demonstration. and display.
Thus acknowledgments are common linguistic
devices used to provide feedback. Broadly speak-
ing, acknowledgments are responsive acts.1 That
is, they are usually uttered in (possibly partial)
response to a production by another speaker; ac-
knowledgment acts express beliefs and intentions
of one conversant with respect to the mutuality of
prior exchanges involving some other conversant.
The intended perlocutionary effect of an acknowl-
edgment act is generally the perception of mutu-
ality of some belief.

In previous research, the function of acknowl-
edgments has been most readily characterized in
terms of attention, understanding and acceptance
on the recipient&apos;s behalf (Kendon, 1967; Schegloff,
1982). In addition, it has been suggested that
they serve to facilitate active participation in dia-
logues and promote &amp;quot;smooth&amp;quot; conversations (Dun-
can and Fiske, 1987).
Schegloff (1982) described two main types
of acknowledgment: continuers and assessments.
Continuers, such as &amp;quot;uh huh,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;quite,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I
see,&amp;quot; act as bridges between units. Conversants
use acknowledgments as continuers to signal con-
tinued attention and to display the recipient&apos;s un-
derstanding that the speaker is in an extended
turn that is not yet complete. Moreover, con-
tinuers indicate the turning down of an oppor-
tunity to undertake a repair subdialogue regard-
ing the previous utterance or to initiate a new
turn. Assessments—such as &amp;quot;oh wow&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;gosh,
really?&amp;quot;— are essentially an elaboration on con-
tinuers. That is, they occur in much the same
environment and have similar properties to con-
tinuers, but in addition express a brief assessment
of the previous utterance.
Empirical analysis of conversations has in-
dicated that the occurrence of acknowledgments
is not arbitrary. Acknowledgments mostly occur
at or near major grammatical boundaries, which
serve as transition-relevance places for turn-taking
(Sacks et al., 1974; Hopper, 1992). In particu-
lar, work by Orestrom (1983) and Goodwin (1986)
suggested a tendency for continuers to overlap
with the primary speaker&apos;s contribution, in such a
way that they serve as bridges between two turn-
constructional units. Assessments, on the other
hand, are generally engineered without overlap.
Goodwin suggested that conversants make special
efforts to prevent assessments from intruding into
subsequent units. That is, the speaker typically
delays production of the subsequent unit until the
recipient&apos;s assessment has been brought to com-
pletion.
Clearly, acknowledgments are an important
device for providing evidence of understanding and
for avoiding miscommunication between parties.
Just as next-relevant-contributions include the en-
tire range of potential task or domain actions, the
task-based role of acknowledgments can be differ-
entiated within their class as acceptances. Beyond
continuers and assessments, we will demonstrate
that acknowledgments incorporate a larger set of
conversational actions, many of which relate to co-
herence of multi-utterance contributions.

In this section, we describe the task characteris-

task-based dialogue, and present an analysis of ac-
knowledgment acts based on corpus material.

The corpus we analyzed was collected by U S
WEST Advanced Technologies in the domain of
a vehicle navigation system (VNS). A VNS is in-
tended to provide travel directions to motorists by
cellular telephone: the system interacts with the
caller to determine the caller&apos;s identity, current
location and destination, and then gives driving
directions a step at a time under the caller&apos;s con-
trol. U S WEST collected the dialogues through
a Wizard-of-Oz experiment (Brunner et al., 1992)
in which the wizard was free to engage in linguis-
tically unconstrained interaction in the VNS task.
Each of the 21 subjects performed three tasks in
the VNS domain. As a whole, the corpus con-
tained 2499 turns and 1107 acknowledgments.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT ACTS

<bodyText confidence="0.999984413793103">
The generally accepted view of acknowledg-
ments, as noted earlier, distinguishes between
two classes—namely continuers and assessments
(Schegloff, 1982). Indeed, there were many oc-
currences of continuers (and a few assessments) in
the VNS corpus. However, our analysis suggests
that acknowledgments perform functions beyond
these two classes. For instance, we observed sev-
eral instances of acknowledgment being used at
the beginning of a turn by the same speaker. This
contrasts with the notions of continuers and as-
sessments which, by definition, occur as unitary
productions in the context of extended turns by
another speaker. Clearly, an acknowledgment oc-
curring at the beginning of a turn is not serving
as a prompt for the other speaker to continue.
To account for the evidence provided by the
VNS corpus, we propose to extend Schegloff&apos;s clas-
sification scheme into a task-based model of ac-
knowledgment acts. This model formalizes the
meaning and usage characteristics of acknowledg-
ments, based on an analysis of what acknowledg-
ments mean and when acknowledgments are used
in the VNS dialogues.
A useful way of looking at the role of acknowl-
edgments in the context of turns is to consider
the basic structural context of exchanges. We
begin by reviewing the concept of an adjacency
pair (Schegloff and Sacks, 1973; Clark and Schae-

fer, 1989). An adjacency pair is formed by two
consecutive utterances that have a canonical re-
lationship, such as question-answer and greeting-
greeting. An acknowledgment can be produced as
the second phase of an adjacency pair or follow-
ing a complete adjacency pair; in each case, the
utterance may contain multiple acceptances. Of
course, an acknowledgment can be produced also
as a single turn that does not relate to an adja-
cency pair. Thus, based on exchange structure
one can distinguish three broad structural classes
of acknowledgments:2
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993540888888889">
• Other-4 ackn, where the acknowledgment forms
the second phase of an adjacency pair;
• Self-+ other-4 ackn, where Self initiates an ex-
change, Other (eventually) completes the ex-
change, and Self then utters an acknowledg-
ment; and
• S elf+ ackn, where Self includes an acknowledg-
ment in an utterance outside of an adjacency
pair.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999750777777778">
In the other-*ackn class, the exchange is a ba-
sic adjacency pair; Other&apos;s act will be composed of
a single turn. In the self- other-4 ackn class, the
exchange initiated and eventually acknowledged
by Self may be composed of multiple turns, with
multiple utterances by both Self and Other. In
the self+ ackn class, the acknowledgment occurs in
a single, extended turn by Self that may contain
multiple utterances.

In this section, we elaborate the structural classes
of acknowledgment through a catalogue of pat-
terns of speech acts that occur in each class.
This catalogue provides broad coverage of patterns
typically encountered in task-oriented discourse.
These patterns describe the context of acknowl-
edgments in terms of exchanges and are derived
from utterances in the VNS corpus. Each act in
an exchange is represented in terms of speech-act
verbs based on the set described by Wierzbicka
(1987) . Table 1 summarizes the speech-act pat-
terns in the catalogue. In the following sections,
we will consider each of the structural classes in

the prior exchange, which is covered by the
self- other-, ackn class. In Clark and Schae-
fer&apos;s (1989) terms, Self&apos;s acknowledgment in the
other--+ ackn class serves as the acceptance phase
for Other&apos;s presentation. As listed in Table 1, the
canonical other-4 ackn patterns are ackn,
ackn +mrequest, request-- ackn+inform,
mdirect--4 ackn and preclose-- ackn.3 In each of
these cases, the first turn is by Other and the sec-
ond turn is Self&apos;s acknowledgment. In some cases,
Self&apos;s turn also extends to include other signifi-
cant utterances. We illustrate the other-- ackn

The inform-+ ackn pattern covers cases where

with an acknowledgment of that act. In the follow-

directions to the user, who acknowledges these di-

Here, the &amp;quot;okay&amp;quot; at turn 1.2 indicates the

ment would be strong evidence of understanding in
Clark and Schaefer&apos;s (1989) terms. An important
point to stress here is that the wizard cannot rely
on the user necessarily having received the infor-
mation that was actually conveyed or formed the
intended interpretation. Rather, the wizard is left
with the user&apos;s response indicating that the user
was apparently satisfied with the wizard&apos;s original
presentation.

The inform-f ackn + mrequest class repre-
sents a significant functional variation on the
inform-+ ackn class just considered. It covers cases
where Other performs an inform act, Self responds
with an acknowledgment of that act and then goes
on to seek clarification of the content of the inform
act. Requests for clarification are kinds of meta-
act because they are concerned with aspects of di-
alogue control rather than the task itself. That is,
requests for clarification are concerned with the
specifics of old information rather than seeking
to elicit largely new information—unlike request-
inform acts.

In this example, the repair is a potential re-

the user&apos;s clarification at 2.2 (&amp;quot;I want to go right

missing from the surface structure of the origi-
nal inform act but which is potentially available—
namely &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;north.&amp;quot;

in the self-fother-fackn class relate to the pre-
vious exchange, rather than just the previous ut-
terance. Broadly speaking, they express the cur-
rent state of the dialogue in addition to embody-
ing the functionality of other-+ ackn acknowledg-
ments. That is, they explicitly mark the com-
pletion of the antecedent exchange and indicate
that the dialogue will either enter a new exchange
or resume an existing exchange. Furthermore,
self-+ other-f ackn acknowledgments signal under-
standing and acceptance of both the previous ex-
change and the previous utterance. The canon-
ical patterns of the self-fother- fackn class, as
listed in Table 1, include inform-fackn-fackn,
request-f inform-4 ackn, mrequest-f inform-4 ackn
and mdirect- fackn-fackn. We illustrate the
self-4 other-f ackn class through examination of
the request-* inf orm-f ackn pattern.
Request-+Inform--■Ackn
The request- &gt;inform- fackn class covers cases
where Self requests an inform act of Other. Other
then performs that inform act and Self acknowl-
edges. Note that the acknowledgment in this case
follows a completed request-inform adjacency pair.
Earlier, we mentioned that question-answer adja-
cency pairs can be regarded as special cases of
request-inform adjacency pairs (Searle, 1969). In
the following example, the wizard requests the
user&apos;s start location. The user satisfies this re-
quest by communicating the desired information
and the wizard then acknowledges. Here the ac-
knowledgment at 3.3 serves to indicate acceptance
(that is, receipt, understanding and agreement) of
the user&apos;s inform act and is a signal that the re-
quest initiated by the wizard at 3.1 has been sat-
isfied and thus the exchange is complete.

when Self issues an acknowledgment following

are still closely tied with the idea of establish-

In this pattern, Self uses an acknowledgment

for one and a half miles to Evans Avenue.
Then turn left on Evans Avenue and go
one and a quarter miles to South Josephine

South Josephine Street. Nineteen Forty
South Josephine is within the first block.
This particular self-acknowledgment is very
similar to a continuer—indeed it may be regarded
as a self-continuer. The wizard&apos;s acknowledgment
in this example represents a sort of temporizing, a
chance for the wizard to &amp;quot;catch his mental breath.&amp;quot;
For the user, this sort of &amp;quot;Okay&amp;quot; thus signals that
the wizard intends to continue his turn. This is
functionally distinct from a meta-request of the
form &amp;quot;Okay?&amp;quot; because there is no rising intona-
tion and the wizard does not wait for a response.
In fact, use of a self-acknowledgment at the end of
a turn would be peculiar.

that basic patterns can used to build more com-
plex patterns. This can lead potentially to vari-
ations in patterns of acknowledgments. In par-
ticular, it is possible to observe cascades of ac-
knowledgments as nested exchanges are &amp;quot;popped&amp;quot;
one by one. Simple acts may be replaced by more
complex exchanges, so that an inform act may be
replaced by an exchange that accomplishes an in-
form via a sequence of informs, clarifications and
acknowledgments. In this section we will consider
one of the variations encountered in the VNS cor-
pus; where an inform—*ackn--)•ackn replaces the
inform act in an inform--+ackn sequence. In the
following example, there are three successive ac-
knowledgment acts. The first acknowledgment at
5.2 is accompanied by a verbatim response by the
user. It is the second phase of the inform--ackn
adjacency pair, indicating understanding and ac-
ceptance of the wizard&apos;s inform act in which a di-
rection was clarified. The second acknowledgment,
issued by the wizard at 5.3, marks the completion
of the informackn exchange. That is, the wiz-
ard recognizes that it is his or her turn yet has
nothing more to add, so indicates passing up the
turn with an acknowledgment. The third acknowl-
edgment, issued by the user at 5.4, is associated
with the user recognizing that the wizard has fin-
ished clarifying directions; the user thus acknowl-
edges this embedded inform act. The user then
indicates satisfaction and approval of the wizard&apos;s
directions with the assessment &amp;quot;Sounds good.&amp;quot;

4 CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962682926829">
Why is a conversation-analytic study of acknowl-
edgment useful in the development of spoken
language systems? SLSs developers face the
dual challenges of creating both domain-based
dialogues and repair-oriented dialogues. Lack-
ing systematic mechanisms for natural mainte-
nance of mutuality, SLSs tend to rely on do-
main structures—producing rather stolid interac-
tion. The most advanced systems incorporate re-
pair acts, but are unable to relate the repairs to the
main dialogue structures in a natural way. The ac-
knowledgment model described in this paper pro-
vides a systematic method of maintaining mutu-
ality of knowledge for both domain and control
information.
More concretely, using this model SLSs can
account for acknowledgments by both user and
system. The corpus evidence suggests that users&apos;
utterances in unconstrained dialogues contain
many instances of acknowledgment. In interpret-
ing these utterances, identification of the appro-
priate acknowledgment function affects the state
of the dialogue model and thus plays an important
role in determining an appropriate response by the
system. In producing such responses, the acknowl-
edgment model can provide structurally appropri-
ate utterances. The fundamental idea is to pro-
duce contextually appropriate acknowledgments
that advances the dialogue seamlessly with respect
to both domain and control functions. That is, the
system needs to give the right signals at the right
time.
The evidence of the U S WEST VNS cor-
pus suggests that understanding and production of
domain and control utterances are closely linked;
they thus cannot be implemented as independent
mechanisms in an SLS. For example, giving direc-
tions involves presenting large amounts of infor-
mation for which an installment approach often
proved effective. Typically the user was given the
opportunity to choose the style of presentation of
</bodyText>

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999547625">
directions, either step-by-step or all at once. The
choice of presentation method by the conversants
was a dynamic one: in cases where it became ap-
parent that the user was experiencing difficulties
with either hearing or understanding directions,
the wizard often resorted to the step-by-step ap-
proach. This form of repair changed the process of
interaction so that the comprehension of each in-
stallment was verified before proceeding with the
next.
The conversants in the VNS corpus displayed
relatively higher rates of use of acknowledgment in
repair situations or when unplanned events arose
(e.g., the user had gotten lost). Intuitively, people
make more effort to establish mutual knowledge
when it is apparent that miscommunication has
occurred than at other times; their certainty cri-
terion for mutuality (Clark and Marshall, 1981)
is raised as a result of the need for repair. This
suggests that a facility for acknowledgment is an
important element in the development of robust
SLSs because use of acknowledgment is most crit-
ical precisely when the conversation has gone awry.
We are currently developing a computational
model of acknowledgment based on the empirical
work presented in this paper. This model is in-
tended for integration into a SLS where it will
serve both to predict when acknowledgments are
appropriate from the system and when to expect
acknowledgments from the user. Briefly, deter-
mining the applicability of an acknowledgment in-
volves interpreting exchanges in terms of speech
acts and then mapping these speech-act patterns
onto the acknowledgment classes described. This,
we believe, will facilitate improved SLS robustness
through achievement of a greater degree of mutual
understanding and provide a more natural and in-
tuitive interaction. The utility and implementa-
tion of the empirical model will be the focus of a
later paper.

<abstract confidence="0.994244547663553">We refine and extend prior views of the description, purposes, and contexts-of-use of acknowledgment acts through empirical examination of the use of acknowledgments in task-based conversation. We distinguish three broad classes of acknowledgments (other —ackn, selfother--■ackn, and self+ackn) and present a catalogue of 13 patterns within these classes that account for the specific uses of acknowledgment in the corpus. 1 MOTIVATION This study is motivated by the need for better dialogue models in spoken-language systems (SLSs). Dialogue models contribute directly to the interaction by providing inter-utterance coherence. Fluent understanding and use of acknowledgments should improve spoken-language systems in at least the following ways: Preventing miscommunication. Acknowledgments are an important device for establishing mutual knowledge and signaling comprehension. Early detection and correction of cases of miscommunication and misunderstanding should prevent failure that would otherwise have been even more catastrophic. Improved naturalness. are a prominent feature of human-human dialogue. Supporting the use of acknowledgments for both the system and the user will emphasize the &amp;quot;naturalness&amp;quot; of interfaces and improve their utility. Dialogue control. cope with dialogue control (e.g., turn-taking) with seemingly little or no effort. Acknowledgments form an intricate relationship with dialogue control mechanisms. Understanding these control mechanisms is central to the development and success of spoken language systems in order to &amp;quot;track&amp;quot; dialogues and determine appropriate system actions. Improved recognition. the extent that a dialogue model can narrow the range of possible contexts for interpretation of a user&apos;s utterance, a spoken-language system&apos;s speech recognition performance will be improved (Young et al., 1989). We seek to refine and extend prior views of the description, purposes, and contexts-of-use of acknowledgment acts through empirical examination of the use of acknowledgments in task-based conversation. In particular, we seek to describe systematically (1) the communicative value of an acknowledgment and (2) the circumstances of its use. The scope of our inquiry involves spoken interaction. We present a catalogue of types of acknowledgment. This catalogue is based on a process model of acknowledgment that explains instances of these acts in a corpus of task-based conversations. 2 RELATED WORK Clark and Schaefer (1989) suggested that acknowledgments are an important component of a larger framework through which communicating parties provide evidence of understanding. Conversants have a range of means, which vary with respect to strength, for indicating acceptance of a presentation. These include continued attention, initiation of the next relevant contribution, acknowledgment, demonstration. and display. Thus acknowledgments are common linguistic devices used to provide feedback. Broadly speakacknowledgments are responsive That is, they are usually uttered in (possibly partial) response to a production by another speaker; acknowledgment acts express beliefs and intentions of one conversant with respect to the mutuality of prior exchanges involving some other conversant. The intended perlocutionary effect of an acknowledgment act is generally the perception of mutuality of some belief. notable exception is the self-acknowledgment which will be discussed shortly 96 In previous research, the function of acknowledgments has been most readily characterized in terms of attention, understanding and acceptance on the recipient&apos;s behalf (Kendon, 1967; Schegloff, 1982). In addition, it has been suggested that they serve to facilitate active participation in dialogues and promote &amp;quot;smooth&amp;quot; conversations (Duncan and Fiske, 1987). Schegloff (1982) described two main types of acknowledgment: continuers and assessments. Continuers, such as &amp;quot;uh huh,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;quite,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I see,&amp;quot; act as bridges between units. Conversants use acknowledgments as continuers to signal continued attention and to display the recipient&apos;s understanding that the speaker is in an extended turn that is not yet complete. Moreover, continuers indicate the turning down of an opportunity to undertake a repair subdialogue regarding the previous utterance or to initiate a new turn. Assessments—such as &amp;quot;oh wow&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;gosh, really?&amp;quot;— are essentially an elaboration on continuers. That is, they occur in much the same environment and have similar properties to continuers, but in addition express a brief assessment of the previous utterance. Empirical analysis of conversations has indicated that the occurrence of acknowledgments is not arbitrary. Acknowledgments mostly occur at or near major grammatical boundaries, which serve as transition-relevance places for turn-taking (Sacks et al., 1974; Hopper, 1992). In particular, work by Orestrom (1983) and Goodwin (1986) suggested a tendency for continuers to overlap with the primary speaker&apos;s contribution, in such a way that they serve as bridges between two turnconstructional units. Assessments, on the other hand, are generally engineered without overlap. Goodwin suggested that conversants make special efforts to prevent assessments from intruding into subsequent units. That is, the speaker typically delays production of the subsequent unit until the recipient&apos;s assessment has been brought to completion. Clearly, acknowledgments are an important device for providing evidence of understanding and for avoiding miscommunication between parties. Just as next-relevant-contributions include the entire range of potential task or domain actions, the task-based role of acknowledgments can be differentiated within their class as acceptances. Beyond continuers and assessments, we will demonstrate that acknowledgments incorporate a larger set of conversational actions, many of which relate to coherence of multi-utterance contributions. 3 DIALOGUE ANALYSIS In this section, we describe the task characteristics and the corpus used for this study, present a theoretical model of acknowledgment acts in task-based dialogue, and present an analysis of acknowledgment acts based on corpus material. 3.1 THE VEHICLE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CORPUS The corpus we analyzed was collected by U S WEST Advanced Technologies in the domain of a vehicle navigation system (VNS). A VNS is intended to provide travel directions to motorists by cellular telephone: the system interacts with the caller to determine the caller&apos;s identity, current location and destination, and then gives driving directions a step at a time under the caller&apos;s control. U S WEST collected the dialogues through a Wizard-of-Oz experiment (Brunner et al., 1992) in which the wizard was free to engage in linguistically unconstrained interaction in the VNS task. Each of the 21 subjects performed three tasks in the VNS domain. As a whole, the corpus contained 2499 turns and 1107 acknowledgments. 3.2 A TASK-BASED MODEL OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT ACTS The generally accepted view of acknowledgments, as noted earlier, distinguishes between two classes—namely continuers and assessments (Schegloff, 1982). Indeed, there were many occurrences of continuers (and a few assessments) in the VNS corpus. However, our analysis suggests that acknowledgments perform functions beyond these two classes. For instance, we observed several instances of acknowledgment being used at the beginning of a turn by the same speaker. This contrasts with the notions of continuers and assessments which, by definition, occur as unitary productions in the context of extended turns by another speaker. Clearly, an acknowledgment occurring at the beginning of a turn is not serving as a prompt for the other speaker to continue. To account for the evidence provided by the VNS corpus, we propose to extend Schegloff&apos;s classification scheme into a task-based model of acknowledgment acts. This model formalizes the meaning and usage characteristics of acknowledgments, based on an analysis of what acknowledgments mean and when acknowledgments are used in the VNS dialogues. A useful way of looking at the role of acknowledgments in the context of turns is to consider the basic structural context of exchanges. We begin by reviewing the concept of an adjacency (Schegloff and Sacks, 1973; Clark and Schae- 97 fer, 1989). An adjacency pair is formed by two consecutive utterances that have a canonical relationship, such as question-answer and greetinggreeting. An acknowledgment can be produced as the second phase of an adjacency pair or following a complete adjacency pair; in each case, the utterance may contain multiple acceptances. Of course, an acknowledgment can be produced also as a single turn that does not relate to an adjacency pair. Thus, based on exchange structure one can distinguish three broad structural classes Other-4 ackn, the acknowledgment forms the second phase of an adjacency pair; Self-+ other-4 ackn, Self initiates an exchange, Other (eventually) completes the exchange, and Self then utters an acknowledgment; and S elf+ ackn, Self includes an acknowledgment in an utterance outside of an adjacency pair. the class, exchange is a basic adjacency pair; Other&apos;s act will be composed of single turn. In the other-4 ackn the exchange initiated and eventually acknowledged by Self may be composed of multiple turns, with multiple utterances by both Self and Other. In ackn the acknowledgment occurs in a single, extended turn by Self that may contain multiple utterances. 3.3 A CATALOGUE OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT ACTS IN TASK-BASED DIALOGUE In this section, we elaborate the structural classes of acknowledgment through a catalogue of patterns of speech acts that occur in each class. This catalogue provides broad coverage of patterns typically encountered in task-oriented discourse. These patterns describe the context of acknowledgments in terms of exchanges and are derived from utterances in the VNS corpus. Each act in an exchange is represented in terms of speech-act verbs based on the set described by Wierzbicka (1987) . Table 1 summarizes the speech-act patterns in the catalogue. In the following sections, we will consider each of the structural classes in turn and provide examples of selected patterns the VNS corpus. We also consider embedfor structural class names indicates turns delimited by arrows Acts combined within a turn are joined with a plus (+) symbol. Other and to non-acknowledgment acts by the respective conversants. &amp;quot;Self&amp;quot; refers to the party producing the acknowledgment; &amp;quot;Other&amp;quot; is the other party. ded exchanges, in which basic patterns are used to build more complex patterns. in the relate principally to the immediately antecedent utterance as opposed to the prior exchange, which is covered by the other-, ackn In Clark and Schaefer&apos;s (1989) terms, Self&apos;s acknowledgment in the ackn serves as the acceptance phase for Other&apos;s presentation. As listed in Table 1, the ackn ackn, ackn +mrequest, request-ackn+inform, ackn In each of these cases, the first turn is by Other and the second turn is Self&apos;s acknowledgment. In some cases, Self&apos;s turn also extends to include other signifiutterances. We illustrate the ackn through examination of the ackn ackn+mrequest ackn covers cases where performs an and Self responds with an acknowledgment of that act. In the followof an ackn, wizard gives directions to the user, who acknowledges these directions. This is an example of an acknowledgment that Schegloff (1982) would call a continuer. 1 On Evans, you need to turn left and head West for approximately three quarters of a mile to Clermont. And, um, on Clermont you turn left, heading South for about two blocks to Riff. Here, the &amp;quot;okay&amp;quot; at turn 1.2 indicates the user&apos;s acceptance of the wizard&apos;s utterance. That is, the acknowledgment implies that the user understood information given by the wizard— more emphatically than a simple next-relevantresponse. Use of the acknowledgmrequest are forms of metaact in which the speaker initiates a clarification subdialogue or otherwise explicitly addresses the control of conversation; quest extensions of Wierzbicka&apos;s (1987) speech-act categories following Novick&apos;s (1988) meta-act analysis. the examples, the acknowledgment of principal interest is highlighted. examples are extracted from a corpus of telephone dialogues from a task-oriented &amp;quot;Wizard-of-Oz&amp;quot; protocol collection study described in Section 3.1. The examples in this paper are notated with the corpus dialogue reference number and each turn is numbered for purposes of reference. 98 Other-4 Ackn Self-+ Other-f Ackn Self- F Ackn inform---ackn inform--ackn+mrequest requestackn+inform mdirect--4ackn preclose-ackn inform-*ackn--4ackn requestinform--+ackn mrequest-*inform--+ackn mdirect--fackn--*ackn inform+ackn+inform mrequest+ackn mdirect+ackn Table 1: A Summary of Speech-Act Patterns for Structural Classes of Acknowledgment ment would be strong evidence of understanding in Clark and Schaefer&apos;s (1989) terms. An important point to stress here is that the wizard cannot rely on the user necessarily having received the information that was actually conveyed or formed the intended interpretation. Rather, the wizard is left with the user&apos;s response indicating that the user was apparently satisfied with the wizard&apos;s original presentation. ackn + mrequest represents a significant functional variation on the ackn just considered. It covers cases where Other performs an inform act, Self responds with an acknowledgment of that act and then goes on to seek clarification of the content of the inform act. Requests for clarification are kinds of metaact because they are concerned with aspects of dialogue control rather than the task itself. That is, requests for clarification are concerned with the specifics of old information rather than seeking to elicit largely new information—unlike requestinform acts. Example 2 (U4.3.1) Okay. Then you want to go north on Speer Boulevard for one and one half miles to Alcott Street. want to go right on Speer? It will be a left. In this example, the repair is a potential request for specification (Lloyd, 1992). That is, user&apos;s clarification at 2.2 to go right on Speer?&amp;quot;) focuses on information which was missing from the surface structure of the original inform act but which is potentially available— namely &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;north.&amp;quot; the relate to the previous exchange, rather than just the previous utterance. Broadly speaking, they express the current state of the dialogue in addition to embodythe functionality of ackn acknowledgments. That is, they explicitly mark the completion of the antecedent exchange and indicate that the dialogue will either enter a new exchange or resume an existing exchange. Furthermore, other-f ackn signal understanding and acceptance of both the previous exchange and the previous utterance. The canonpatterns of the fackn as in Table 1, include request-f inform-4 ackn, mrequest-f inform-4 ackn fackn-fackn. illustrate the other-f ackn through examination of inf orm-f pattern. &gt;informfackn covers cases Self requests an of Other. Other performs that and Self acknowledges. Note that the acknowledgment in this case follows a completed request-inform adjacency pair. Earlier, we mentioned that question-answer adjacency pairs can be regarded as special cases of request-inform adjacency pairs (Searle, 1969). In the following example, the wizard requests the user&apos;s start location. The user satisfies this request by communicating the desired information and the wizard then acknowledges. Here the acknowledgment at 3.3 serves to indicate acceptance (that is, receipt, understanding and agreement) of the user&apos;s inform act and is a signal that the request initiated by the wizard at 3.1 has been satisfied and thus the exchange is complete. Example 3 (U2.1.1) Okay and uh, what&apos;s your starting location? I&apos;m at 36th and Sheridan at the Park-n-Ride. moment please. Self+Ackn occur when Self issues an acknowledgment following some action (either verbal or physical) performed by Self. These are not responsive acts, unlike other acknowledgment usages considered; however, they are still closely tied with the idea of establishing mutual beliefs. The canonical patterns, as 99 in Table 1, include illustrate through examination of the ininform+Ackn+Inform In this pattern, Self uses an acknowledgment in the middle of an extended turn. Consider the following example: Example 4 (U5.3.1) All right, urn, the first thing you need to do is go South on Logan Street for one and a half miles to Evans Avenue. Then turn left on Evans Avenue and go one and a quarter miles to South Josephine Street. Okay, then you&apos;ll turn left on South Josephine Street. Nineteen Forty South Josephine is within the first block. This particular self-acknowledgment is very similar to a continuer—indeed it may be regarded a wizard&apos;s acknowledgment in this example represents a sort of temporizing, a chance for the wizard to &amp;quot;catch his mental breath.&amp;quot; For the user, this sort of &amp;quot;Okay&amp;quot; thus signals that the wizard intends to continue his turn. This is functionally distinct from a meta-request of the form &amp;quot;Okay?&amp;quot; because there is no rising intonation and the wizard does not wait for a response. In fact, use of a self-acknowledgment at the end of a turn would be peculiar. Embedded Exchanges noted earlier that basic patterns can used to build more complex patterns. This can lead potentially to variations in patterns of acknowledgments. In particular, it is possible to observe cascades of acknowledgments as nested exchanges are &amp;quot;popped&amp;quot; one by one. Simple acts may be replaced by more complex exchanges, so that an inform act may be replaced by an exchange that accomplishes an inform via a sequence of informs, clarifications and acknowledgments. In this section we will consider one of the variations encountered in the VNS corwhere an the in an In the following example, there are three successive acknowledgment acts. The first acknowledgment at 5.2 is accompanied by a verbatim response by the It is the second phase of the adjacency pair, indicating understanding and acof the wizard&apos;s in which a direction was clarified. The second acknowledgment, issued by the wizard at 5.3, marks the completion the That is, the wizard recognizes that it is his or her turn yet has nothing more to add, so indicates passing up the with an acknowledgment. The third acknowledgment, issued by the user at 5.4, is associated with the user recognizing that the wizard has finished clarifying directions; the user thus acknowlthis embedded The user then indicates satisfaction and approval of the wizard&apos;s directions with the assessment &amp;quot;Sounds good.&amp;quot; Example 5 (U6.2.1) Okay, it was, urn, on Evans it&apos;s three and three quarter miles to Jasmine. Three, right, good. 4 CONCLUSION Why is a conversation-analytic study of acknowledgment useful in the development of spoken language systems? SLSs developers face the dual challenges of creating both domain-based dialogues and repair-oriented dialogues. Lacking systematic mechanisms for natural maintenance of mutuality, SLSs tend to rely on domain structures—producing rather stolid interaction. The most advanced systems incorporate repair acts, but are unable to relate the repairs to the main dialogue structures in a natural way. The acknowledgment model described in this paper provides a systematic method of maintaining mutuality of knowledge for both domain and control information. More concretely, using this model SLSs can account for acknowledgments by both user and system. The corpus evidence suggests that users&apos; utterances in unconstrained dialogues contain many instances of acknowledgment. In interpreting these utterances, identification of the appropriate acknowledgment function affects the state of the dialogue model and thus plays an important role in determining an appropriate response by the system. In producing such responses, the acknowledgment model can provide structurally appropriate utterances. The fundamental idea is to produce contextually appropriate acknowledgments that advances the dialogue seamlessly with respect to both domain and control functions. That is, the system needs to give the right signals at the right time. The evidence of the U S WEST VNS corpus suggests that understanding and production of domain and control utterances are closely linked; they thus cannot be implemented as independent mechanisms in an SLS. For example, giving directions involves presenting large amounts of information for which an installment approach often proved effective. Typically the user was given the opportunity to choose the style of presentation of 1 00 directions, either step-by-step or all at once. The choice of presentation method by the conversants was a dynamic one: in cases where it became apparent that the user was experiencing difficulties with either hearing or understanding directions, the wizard often resorted to the step-by-step approach. This form of repair changed the process of interaction so that the comprehension of each installment was verified before proceeding with the next. The conversants in the VNS corpus displayed relatively higher rates of use of acknowledgment in repair situations or when unplanned events arose (e.g., the user had gotten lost). Intuitively, people make more effort to establish mutual knowledge when it is apparent that miscommunication has occurred than at other times; their certainty criterion for mutuality (Clark and Marshall, 1981) is raised as a result of the need for repair. This suggests that a facility for acknowledgment is an important element in the development of robust SLSs because use of acknowledgment is most critical precisely when the conversation has gone awry. We are currently developing a computational model of acknowledgment based on the empirical work presented in this paper. This model is intended for integration into a SLS where it will serve both to predict when acknowledgments are appropriate from the system and when to expect acknowledgments from the user. Briefly, determining the applicability of an acknowledgment involves interpreting exchanges in terms of speech acts and then mapping these speech-act patterns onto the acknowledgment classes described. This, we believe, will facilitate improved SLS robustness through achievement of a greater degree of mutual understanding and provide a more natural and intuitive interaction. The utility and implementation of the empirical model will be the focus of a later paper. 5 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</abstract>

This model is intended for integration into a SLS where it will serve both to predict when acknowledgments are appropriate from the system and when to expect acknowledgments from the user.

Conversants have a range of means, which vary with respect to strength, for indicating acceptance of a presentation. These include continued attention, initiation of the next relevant contribution, acknowledgment, demonstration. and display.

To account for the evidence provided by the VNS corpus, we propose to extend Schegloff&apos;s classification scheme into a task-based model of acknowledgment acts. This model formalizes the meaning and usage characteristics of acknowledgments, based on an analysis of what acknowledgments mean and when acknowledgments are used in the VNS dialogues. A useful way of looking at the role of acknowledgments in the context of turns is to consider the basic structural context of exchanges. We begin by reviewing the concept of an adjacency pair (Schegloff and Sacks, 1973; Clark and Schae97 fer, 1989). An adjacency pair is formed by two consecutive utterances that have a canonical relationship, such as question-answer and greetinggreeting. An acknowledgment can be produced as the second phase of an adjacency pair or following a complete adjacency pair; in each case, the utterance may contain multiple acceptances. Of course, an acknowledgment can be produced also as a single turn that does not relate to an adjacency pair. Thus, based on exchange structure one can distinguish three broad structural classes of acknowledgments:2 • Other-4 ackn, where the acknowled</context>

U S WEST collected the dialogues through a Wizard-of-Oz experiment (Brunner et al., 1992) in which the wizard was free to engage in linguistically unconstrained interaction in the VNS task. Each of the 21 subjects performed three tasks in the VNS domain. As a whole, the corpus contained 2499 turns and 1107 acknowledgments. 3.2 A TASK-BASED MODEL OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT ACTS The generally accepted view of acknowledgments, as noted earlier, distinguishes between two classes—namely continuers and assessments (Schegloff, 1982). Indeed, there were many occurrences of continuers (and a few assessments) in the VNS corpus. However, our analysis suggests that acknowledgments perform functions beyond these two classes. For instance, we observed several instances of acknowledgment being used at the beginning of a turn by the same speaker. This contrasts with the notions of continuers and assessments which, by definition, occur as unitary productions in the context of extended turns by another speaker. Clearly, an acknowledgment occurring at the beginning of a turn is not serving as a prompt for the other speaker to contin</context>

In some cases, Self&apos;s turn also extends to include other significant utterances. We illustrate the other-- ackn class through examination of the inform-+ ackn and inform--- ackn+mrequest patterns. Inform-4Ackn The inform-+ ackn pattern covers cases where Other performs an inform act and Self responds with an acknowledgment of that act. In the following example4 of an inform-- ackn, the wizard gives directions to the user, who acknowledges these directions. This is an example of an acknowledgment that Schegloff (1982) would call a continuer. Example 1 (U6.3.1)5 (1.1) Wizard: On Evans, you need to turn left and head West for approximately three quarters of a mile to Clermont. (1.2) User: Okay. (1.3) Wizard: And, um, on Clermont you turn left, heading South for about two blocks to Riff. Here, the &amp;quot;okay&amp;quot; at turn 1.2 indicates the user&apos;s acceptance of the wizard&apos;s utterance. That is, the acknowledgment implies that the user understood information given by the wizard— more emphatically than a simple next-relevantcontribution response.

Request-+Inform--■Ackn The request- &gt;inform- fackn class covers cases where Self requests an inform act of Other. Other then performs that inform act and Self acknowledges. Note that the acknowledgment in this case follows a completed request-inform adjacency pair. Earlier, we mentioned that question-answer adjacency pairs can be regarded as special cases of request-inform adjacency pairs (Searle, 1969). In the following example, the wizard requests the user&apos;s start location. The user satisfies this request by communicating the desired information and the wizard then acknowledges. Here the acknowledgment at 3.3 serves to indicate acceptance (that is, receipt, understanding and agreement) of the user&apos;s inform act and is a signal that the request initiated by the wizard at 3.1 has been satisfied and thus the exchange is complete.

These patterns describe the context of acknowledgments in terms of exchanges and are derived from utterances in the VNS corpus. Each act in an exchange is represented in terms of speech-act verbs based on the set described by Wierzbicka (1987) . Table 1 summarizes the speech-act patterns in the catalogue.

Humans cope with dialogue control (e.g., turn-taking) with seemingly little or no effort. Acknowledgments form an intricate relationship with dialogue control mechanisms. Understanding these control mechanisms is central to the development and success of spoken language systems in order to &amp;quot;track&amp;quot; dialogues and determine appropriate system actions. • Improved recognition. To the extent that a dialogue model can narrow the range of possible contexts for interpretation of a user&apos;s utterance, a spoken-language system&apos;s speech recognition performance will be improved (Young et al., 1989). We seek to refine and extend prior views of the description, purposes, and contexts-of-use of acknowledgment acts through empirical examination of the use of acknowledgments in task-based conversation. In particular, we seek to describe systematically (1) the communicative value of an acknowledgment and (2) the circumstances of its use. The scope of our inquiry involves spoken interaction. We present a catalogue of types of acknowledgment. This catalogue is based on a process model of acknowledgment that explains instances of these acts in a corpus of task-based conversations. 2 RELATED WORK</context>
