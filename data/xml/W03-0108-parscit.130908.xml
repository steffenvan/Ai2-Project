We describe a purely confidence-based geo-

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.983452069767442">
Many questions about geographic term disambiguation
are standardly handled in a statistical framework: for ex-
ample, we can ask that, in the absence of contextual in-
formation, with what probability does the word Madison
refer to a person (e.g. James Madison), an organization
(e.g. Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan), or a place
(e.g. Madison, Wisconsin), and if no other disambigua-
tion alternative exists, we can expect these three numbers
to sum to 1 (i.e. behave like probabilities).
However, there are many other questions where a
strictly probability-based framework is less appropriate.
In particular, much of the information that could be used
to disambiguate spatial references in natural language
text is strongly non-local in character, and as we increase
the amount of this background information, eventually
we reach the point when the amount of training data per
parameter is so low that there is no repeatable experiment
to base probabilities on.
In such cases, “probabilities” are effectively used as a
stand-in for what is really our confidence in one judgment
or another. In this paper we describe some of the meth-
ods used in a purely confidence-based geographic term
disambiguation system that crucially relies on the notion
of “positive” and “negative” context.
Far more information is contained in unstructured text
(such as the Web and message traffic) than in structured
databases, so automatically processing ambiguous geo-
graphic references unlocks a large amount of informa-

tion. Adding spatial dimensions to the document search
systems requires new algorithms for determining the rele-
vance of documents. We describe methods for combining
confidence-based disambiguation with measures of rele-
vance to a user’s query.
It has become clear after several decades of artificial
intelligence research that automated general natural lan-
guage understanding is not feasible yet. However, we
have been able to make progress by restricting our ef-
fort to the well-defined domain of geographic concepts,
using statistical methods on extremely large corpora. To
cope with billions of documents, we have built fast al-
gorithms for extracting and disambiguating geographic

information and fast database algorithms specifically for
information which has a spatial component.
One form of information retrieval made possible by
extracting geographic meaning in large corpora is geo-
graphic text search. Users are presented with an interface
containing a traditional text search form combined with a
map. They can zoom in on areas of the world that are of
interest, and results of textual queries are plotted on the
map (Figure 1). Other forms of data exploration are also
made possible, such as exploring the spatial density pat-
tern of documents satisfying a textual query (Figure 2).
In Section 2 we explore challenges of finding geo-
graphic meaning in natural language texts and give ex-
amples of typical ambiguities. In Section 3 we introduce
some of our methods for determining geographic mean-
ing in natural language. In Section 4 we describe some
of the methods of determining geographic meaning dur-
ing real-time processing. In Section 5 we describe some
of our training methods. In Section 6 we describe meth-
ods for combining confidence-based disambiguation with
measures of relevance to a user’s query.
2 Challenges of finding geographic
meaning in natural language text
Like other references in natural language text, geographic
references are often highly under-specified and ambigu-
ous. To take an extreme example, when encountering a
reference to Al Hamra, the task is to determine which of
the 65 places in the world with that name is being referred
to, or even whether a place is being referred to at all, for
the phrase also means red in Arabic. The same applies to
the more than two dozen US towns named Madison. In
fact, the majority of references to places are ambiguous
in this way.
Human beings have a remarkable ability to derive use-
ful information from ambiguous and under-specified ref-
erences using real-world knowledge and experience, by
deriving fuzzy rules from experience and knowing when
to apply them. MetaCarta imitates this process using
combinations of heuristics and data mining. For exam-
ple, when encountering a mention of Al Hamra, a hu-
man analyst may notice that the rest of the document is
focused on a region of Oman. Even if there is no men-
tion of Oman itself, a mention of the nearby place Safil in
the same document makes it likely that the Al Hamra in
Oman is referred to. Even though there is another place
named Safil in Iran, the towns of Safil and Al Hamra in
Oman are close to each other, while there is no Al Hamra
close to Safil, Iran.
People also apply real-world knowledge gained in
other contexts: they know, for example, that a refer-
ence to a place called Madison, in the absence of a state,
is more likely to refer to Madison, Wisconsin than the
smaller Madison, Iowa; and they know that James Madi-
son and the Madison family do not refer to places at all.
Similarly they know that Ishihara does not refer to a
place, even though there is a Japanese town of that name,
if a government minister named Ishihara is being men-
tioned.
Moreover, much of the information people use to dis-
ambiguate references is not contained within the docu-
ment itself, but is in the form of experience gained from
reading many other documents. When encountering a
name, people have various associations with the uses of
this name they have seen before, and have a rough idea of
how often it referred to places.

meaning in natural language
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976548387097">
MetaCarta has been able to imitate many aspects of this
common-sense process because of the well-defined, low-
dimensional space of geographic concepts. We begin
with a gazetteer containing several million name-point
and name-region pairs, and the enclosure relationship be-
tween regions and points. A given name n may refer
to several points or regions, or refer to a non-geographic
concept. To deal with ambiguity, for every potential ref-
erence of a name n to a point p, we estimate c(p, n), the
confidence that n really refers to p. The relevance of the
document to each mentioned location must also be de-
termined, in order to present the results that best satisfy
the need for both correctness and relevance to a query, as
described in Section 6.
There are two main phases of processing involved in
the extraction of geographic information: training on
large corpora, and real-time processing of a document.
In order to index large volumes of documents in a
reasonable time, documents must be processed at a rate
of at least a hundred documents per second on a sin-
gle workstation. This constraint affects the choice of
heuristics used. Some of the methods of determining
geographic meaning during real-time processing are de-
scribed in Section 4.
The training phase requires some seed system capable
of extracting the geographic information or, in the limit-
ing case, some manually grounded documents. The qual-
ity of training depends on the quality of the seed, so as
the system for the real-time processing of documents im-
proves, we iterate the training process. Some details of
the training process are described in Section 5.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989398">
4.1 Identifying candidate places
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987976971014493">
When processing a document, we begin by identifying
potentially geographic references. For each, we identify
all known candidates for the meaning of that reference.
For example, a reference to ’Madison’ can potentially
mean any of 22 points with that name, or none of them.
The main source of geographic references are names
from the high-quality MetaCarta gazetteer. See (Axel-
rod, 2003) for the process of building and updating this
gazetteer. The procedure used to obtain realistic initial
confidences associated with the gazetteer names is de-
scribed in Section 5.1.
We mention some of the alternative sources of poten-
tially geographic references here. We have capabilities
allowing to match US postal addresses and pass them to
third-party geolocation software producing a coordinate
for the address.
Coordinates such as 38◦01’10.5&amp;quot;N
121◦44’48.8&amp;quot;W or 56.51◦N 25.86◦E are
matched. We match some of JINTACCS (Depart-
ment of the Army, 1990) message traffic formats
such as 163940N 1062920E (means 16◦39’40”N
106◦29’20”E).
The matches are then assigned initial confidences,
and disambiguated using local and non-local information
within the document.
4.2 Geographic disambiguation by local linguistic
context
Similarly to other statistical NLP efforts, we use the lo-
cal document context that a potentially geographic name
occurs in. For example, the words city of or mayor ofpre-
ceding or the words community college following a name
like Madison are strong positive indicators of the geo-
graphic nature of this name. At the same time, the words
Mr., Dr., or a common first name preceding or the words
will arrive following a potential city name are strong neg-
ative indicators that the name in question is geographic.
We use the mixture of data mining procedures de-
scribed in Section 5.2 and domain knowledge reposito-
ries containing context strings such as first names to form
the sets of contexts we are using and to determine their
strength as positive and negative indicators.
Heuristics then adjust the confidence cg,,(n) that n
refers to any geographic location (though not whether it
refers to one of several synonymous locations) according
to the nature and strength of these indicators.
Other local clues, such as absence of upper-case let-
ters in the name itself or the resemblance of the name to
an acronym have also proven useful to further adjust the
values of cg,,.
The values of cg,, are then modified by non-local in-
formation as described below.
4.3 Geographic disambiguation by spatial patterns
of geographic references in documents
We have found that there is a high degree of spatial cor-
relation in geographic references that are in textual prox-
imity. This applies not only to points that are nearby,
such as Madison and Milwaukee, but also to the situation
when points are enclosed by regions, e.g. Madison and
Wisconsin. This correlation between geographic and tex-
tual distance is considered in estimating the confidence
that a name refers to a point.
Some of our heuristics increase c(p, n) based on how
many and which points (and enclosing regions) are men-
tioned in the same document as n and their proximity.
We make use of the characteristics of the nearby loca-
tions, and weight their influence as a decreasing function
of geographic relationships to p and textual relationships
to n. c(p, n) is then increased by a saturating function of
these influences.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996142">
4.4 Domain knowledge: population heuristics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997475">
In addition, population data in the gazetteer is also used.
A place with a high population is more likely to be men-
tioned than a place with a lower one. Thus when disam-
biguating multiple referents with the same name, the pop-
ulation of each is considered. The confidence of a place p
is decreased by an amount proportional to the logarithm
of the ratio of the population of p to the population of all
places with the name n.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.938621">
4.5 Relative references
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946909090909">
Until now we discussed the processing of stand-alone ge-
ographic references. We also process relative geographic
references such as 15 miles northeast of Portland. This
relative reference is resolved in correspondence with the
disambiguation of its anchor reference, Portland. If we
decided that Portland refers to Portland, Oregon with
confidence c, then we assume that 15 miles northeast of
Portland refers to the point 15 miles northeast of Port-
land, Oregon with confidence f(c), where f(c) is greater
than c, since the presence of a well-defined relative refer-
ence serves as an additional linguistic clue.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.982648">
4.6 Temporal information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999493857142857">
While not strictly a geographic issue, we mention
here that the system also extracts temporal informa-
tion from natural language documents. Currently we
recognize military date/time group Zulu formats (Com-
bined Communications-Electronics Board, 1983) such as
301535Z AUG 01 (means August 30, 2001 15:35:00
Zulu).

5.1 Determining the geographic significance of
gazetteer names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983111111111">
The methods for disambiguating geographic terms de-
scribed above can also be exploited at the level of the cor-
pus, despite the fact that the data used for training are un-
tagged and therefore noisy. Since the real-time document
processing system is high throughput, it can be applied
to a training corpus consisting of a few hundred million
documents.
If a name n is often given a high confidence of refer-
ring to a point p, then n is likely to refer to p even in the
absence of other evidence in the document. Thus, each
name-point pair n, p is given an initial confidence which
is the average confidence assigned to an instance in the
training corpus.
This initial confidence is then used as a starting point
and modified by the other heuristics described above to
obtain confidence for a name instance in a specific doc-
ument during real-time document processing. Thus the
training process is iterative.

5.2 Data mining of geographically significant local
linguistic contexts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956833333333">
We currently use data mining on tagged corpora to learn
the contexts in which geographic and non-geographic ref-
erences occur, the words and phrases leading up to and
trailing the name n. The tagged corpora were obtained
using the Alembic tagger (Day et al., 1997). The accu-
mulated statistics allow us to determine whether a spe-
cific context is a positive or negative indicator of a term
being geographic, and the strength of this particular indi-
cator. For any context C, an adjustment is applied to the
confidence which is a nonlinear function of the probabil-
ity of a geographic reference occurring in C in the tagged
corpus.

6 Relevance
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978354166667">
The addition of geographic dimensions to information re-
trieval means that in addition to the relevance of docu-
ments to a textual query, the relevance to the places men-
tioned in those documents must also be considered in or-
der to rank the documents. The two kinds of relevance,
traditional textual query relevance R,,, and georelevance
R9, must be properly balanced to return documents rele-
vant to a user’s query. The traditional textual query rel-
evance is obtained using standard techniques (Robertson
and Jones, 1997).
Georelevance is based on both the geographic confi-
dence of the place names used to place the document on
the map, and the emphasis of the place name in the doc-
ument. Emphasis is affected by the position Pes, of the
name in the document, and the prominence Bes,. The latter
is a function of whether it is in the title or header, whether
it is emphasized or rendered in a large font, and other
clues related to the nature and formatting of a document.
This is similar to term relevance heuristics in information
retrieval (Robertson and Jones, 1997), but the pattern of
emphasis of geographic references is somewhat different.
The function that assigns the emphasis component that is
a function of in-document position is somewhat different
than those usually used. It decreases from a maximum at
the beginning of the document to a low number near the
end of a long document, but increases near the bottom of
the document to account for the increased relevance of in-
formation in footers. The frequency of the name Fes, in the
document is considered in a similar way to standard infor-
mation retrieval techniques (Robertson and Jones, 1997).
Emphasis is also a function of the number of other ge-
ographic references S in the document. This is based on
the assumption that a document does not have an unlim-
ited amount of relevance to “spend” on places. Thus, a
place mentioned in a document with many others is likely
to be less relevant. Once emphasis E(Pes,, Bes,, Fes,, S) is
calculated, it is multiplied by geoconfidence C9 to obtain
the georelevance R9.
We also compute a georelevance-like function for each
location that could be referenced by a document. It varies
as a function of character position in the document and is
independent of geoconfidence.
Finally, the textual query relevance and georelevance
are balanced as follows. The more terms m are in the
user’s query, the higher the weight W,,, we assign to the
term component of the query; however we use a function
W,,, that saturates at a maximal weight M (.5 &lt; M &lt; 1).
The term relevance weight is defined as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.942227666666667">
m − 1
W,,,(m) = .5 + (M − .5)
m
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9911625">
Georelevance and term relevance R,,, are then com-
bined as (1 − W,,,(m))R9 + W,,,(m)R,,,.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999875">
The successful deployment of an industrial high-volume
system partially based on the methods described here,
even in the absence of large amounts of tagged data, has
shown that many elements of common sense relating to
geographic disambiguation can be encoded as heuristics
in a confidence-based framework.

The two kinds of relevance, traditional textual query relevance R,,, and georelevance R9, must be properly balanced to return documents relevant to a user’s query. The traditional textual query relevance is obtained using standard techniques (Robertson and Jones, 1997). Georelevance is based on both the geographic confidence of the place names used to place the document on the map, and the emphasis of the place name in the document. Emphasis is affected by the position Pes, of the name in the document, and the prominence Bes,. The latter is a function of whether it is in the title or header, whether it is emphasized or rendered in a large font, and other clues related to the nature and formatting of a document. This is similar to term relevance heuristics in information retrieval (Robertson and Jones, 1997), but the pattern of emphasis of geographic referen</context>
