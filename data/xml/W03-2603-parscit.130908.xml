Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999682647058823">
Pronoun resolution algorithms often use
elaborate and complicated rules and
weighted factors. In this paper I will
use the framework of Optimality The-
ory to implement an automatic pronoun
resolution system for Dutch. By rank-
ing constraints, Optimality Theory can
be used to model complex behaviour
and preferences, whilst keeping the con-
straints clear and simple. The system
is developed by quantative evaluation
of different configurations on a small
corpus of newspaper articles, contain-
ing 222 pronouns. Even though, from a
practical perspective, the performance is
wanting, some linguistically interesting
results are given.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999795068965517">
In this paper I will present some results of the
development of an automatic pronoun resolution
system for Dutch, i.e. a system where there is
no intervention or correction in the stages from
flat text to resolved pronouns. The system uses
full grammatical information, which it receives
from Alpino (Bouma et al., 2001), a wide cover-
age grammar for Dutch, by means of dependency
structures. This syntactic information is needed
at several points in the resolution process, from
identifying the pronouns to determining agree-
ment values and salience rankings
In pronoun resolution there is typically a di-
vision in the factors between rules and prefer-
ences. The divide between the two is not clear cut.
Some preferences are strongly preferred over oth-
ers, wereas some rules maybe should be allowed to
be broken every once and a while. In Optimality
Theory (0T, Prince and Smolensky (2002)) the to-
tal interaction of rules and preferences is modeled
by assuming soft-constraints that are ranked. The
strict ranking, as opposed to, say, a weighting of
constraints, means the system stays conceptually
clear.
First I will give a short description of the pro-
nouns that are resolved. Then after giving a de-
scription of the algorithm and introducing the con-
straints that are used, I will discuss the results of
testing several configurations on a small corpus.

The pronouns to be resolved by the algorithm
are the third person personal and possessive pro-
nouns, as listed in table I. These pronouns were
selected because they are expected to behave as
topic-sensitive pronouns. The reflexive zichzelf
was added to be able to see the effects of the bind-
ing theory. I
In the first and second row in table I are the

3.1 General Outline
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958764705883">
After tokenisation and parsing, the text is traversed
by the algorithm. On encountering a possible an-
tecedent (currently most NP&apos;s), a feature structure
is created. The FS has a semantic part with nat-
ural agreement values, humanhood and an index,
and a syntactic part with grammatical agreement,
syntactic function and category. The FS is put on
a stack A of possible antecedents.
On encountering a pronoun P from the target
category, the OT system is triggered, with P as the
input. The intricacies of the OT system are given
in the subsection below.
The output of the OT system is the antecedent
for P. A full FS for P is constructed by combin-
ing the pronoun&apos;s syntactic information with the
semantic features of the antecedent. The result is
put on A, to serve as a possible antecedent itself.

3.2 Implementing Optimality Theory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878">
Abstractly, running an OT model could be seen as
going through the following three steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999356166666667">
1. Create for a given input / a set of possible
outputs. This set is called Gen(/), its mem-
bers are referred to as candidates
2. Check for each candidate which constraints it
satisfies, and which not.
3. Calculate the harmony ranking of candidates,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988500424242424">
i.e. how well each candidate satisfies the con-
straints, taking into account that satisfying
certain constraints is more important than sat-
isfying others. The most harmonic candidate
(the optimal one), is selected as the output.
Several computational problems arise for OT,
mainly concerning the construction and the size
of Gen(/). There are various ingenious solutions
to these and other problems (Tesar, 1995; Gerde-
mann and van Noord, 2000). However, the ap-
plication of these solutions to the type of system
I am proposing here, is not very straightforward.
Rather, by making some limiting assumptions, the
abstract OT system above can be implemented al-
most directly:
ad / The input of the system is a partial FS con-
taining syntactical information on the pro-
noun to be resolved P. The output is an an-
tecedent for P and Gen(P) therefore is the
stack with FS&apos;s of possible antecedents, A,
which is composed incrementally. The stack-
size is (somewhat arbitrarily) set to 20. In-
creasing the size has no influence on resolu-
tion accuracy, the effects of reducing it are
only noticable when going down to 10 or be-
low.
ad 2 The constraints are evualuated by checking
feature values of the candidate, or by compar-
ing feature values of the input and the candi-
date, depending on the constraint.
ad 3 Instead of creating a ranking, Gen (P) is sys-
tematically searched for just the optimal can-
didate.2

4 Resolution Constraints
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995635222222222">
The constraints that I propose are traditional
resolution factors (see e.g. Mitkov (1999);
Hirst (1981) for an overview) that in some cases
have been adapted for Dutch. Also they are cast
in OT-style formulations, which typically means
no (or fewer) conditionals.
While introducing the constraints I will give a
few partial rankings. In the experiment possible
total rankings are compared.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.978019666666667">
2The concept of a harmony ranking was introduced here
because it is a useful tool for reasoning about the behaviour
of an OT system. In subsection 4.3, I will come to use it.

4.1 Agreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97975975">
For describing pronoun-antecedent agreement be-
haviour (but also other types of agreement), a dis-
tinction is often made between agreeing ad sen-
sum: with properties of the referent, or ad formam:
with properties of the word form (Corbett, to ap-
pear).
Dutch pronoun-antecedent agreement is a
mixed phenomenon. Dutch NP syntax has two
genders: common (or: de), and neuter (het) gen-
der. For inanimate referents, agreement is ad for-
mam. Generally het-words get het and de-words
get either hij or zij. Human referents take their
pronoun ad sensum. In case of other animate ref-
erents the choice is free (Geerts et al., 1984).3
Number agreement is generally ad formam. The
standard exceptions to this rule are group nouns,
which allow for both singular and plural agree-
ment.
I propose two constraints to model agreement:
RESPECT HUMAN SEX: use the appropriate pro-
noun for a human referent.
AGREE: agree semantically or syntactically.
Syntactic agreement values are filled in in a
candidate&apos;s FS. Candidates with human referents
are also given semantic agreement values. Group
nouns get plural semantic agreement.
One constraint, that is to be ranked higher than
RHS, will take care of a special case: when the an-
tecedent is a pronoun itself, only syntactic agree-
ment is allowed. The is read as &apos;don&apos;t&apos;:
*CHANGE YOUR MIND: If the antecedent is a
pronoun, there has to be syntactic agreement.

4.2 Binding Restrictions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9630186875">
A relatively simple binding theory can be formu-
lated using versions of the well-known binding
principles.
PRINCIPLE A: Zichzelf takes a co-argument as an
antecedent
3This description applies to s.c. Northern Dutch. Speak-
ers of Southern Dutch (mainly in Belgium) allow for syntac-
tic agreement with a human referent. Also they may use a
three-gender system, where the common gender is still di-
vided between ferninin and masculin.
DISJOINT REFERENCE PRINCIPLE: Never take a
co-argument as an antecedent
Notice that the DRP is stated without hedges,
the fact that the conflicting PRINCIPLE A is ranked
over it makes that the binding behaviour is mod-
eled correctly (cf. Beaver (to appear)).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998787">
4.3 Topichood
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992216342105263">
Normally pronouns refer to salient entities, or
even: to the topic. How salience should be mea-
sured and how to determine what the topic is, is a
central issue in many approaches to pronoun reso-
lution of realworld texts.
Centering Theory (CT, Grosz et al. (1995))
links specific definitions of topic (&apos;backward-
looking center&apos;) and salience (&apos;forward-looking
center list&apos;), to model coherence. Utterances yield
salience rankings of entities after grammatical
function. The topic of an utterance is the most
salient entity of the previous utterance that is re-
alised in the current one. Moreover, CT says that
if there are pronouns in a sentence, one of them
should realize the topic.
If we regard the salience ranking in CT — sub-
ject objects other — as a harmony ranking,
we can formulate it in constraints. The constraint
ranking SUBJECT &gt; OBJECT realizes this. The
two constraints can be characterized as:
SUBJECT/OBJECT: The entity is realized in sub-
ject/object position.
An incremental, CT based algorithm is Left-
Right Centering (LRC, Tetreault (2001)). On en-
countering a pronoun, the LRC algorithm looks
through the list of discourse entities it has come
across in the current sentence. The first entity
that meets agreement and binding constraints is se-
lected. If no such is found, it starts looking at the
salience ranking from the previous utterance, etc.
Assuming that the same criteria apply to the par-
tial salience ranking of the current sentence, as do
to the ranking of previous ones, an implementa-
tion of LRC in OT — LRCOT for short — can be
given.
The two function constraints are ranked below:
SENTENTIAL PROXIMITY: Don&apos;t have a sen-
tence boundary between the pronoun and the

This is a constraint of the integer type: a mark is
given for each sentence boundary. Table 2 shows
part of the harmony ranking for SEN PROX &gt;&gt;
SUBJECT &gt;&gt; OBJECT.
Adding the agreement and binding constraints
yields the complete ranking for LRCOT. The pro-
cederal precedence of the salience rankings over
agreement and binding in LRC is not reflected in
LRCOT. Binding and agreement are ranked over
the other constraints because it is more important
to obey them.
Lets look at an example. The LRCOT tableaux
for resolving (3) in contexts (2) and (2&apos;) are given
in (4), (5). 5

Both times the pronoun is resolved to Jan&apos;s fa-
ther. The third candidate in (4) and(5) is ruled
out because it is the only candidate to violate SP
twice. The competition between the first and sec-
ond candidate therefore is decided by the SUB-
JECT constraint.
However, when informally consulting several
native speakers, there did seem to be a difference
in interpretation. With 1-2&apos;-3, Hij = Jan is an op-
tion, perhaps even the preferred one.
The fact that this difference does not turn up in
Standard CT, is because CT relates pronouns to
topics, but not vice versa. Intuitively: the failure
to pronominalize the topic Jan, somehow signals a
topic shift.6 Or, turning it around, pronominaliz-
ing a topic keeps it available for further mention-
ing, and it should therefore be highly salient.
One way of dealing with this is to take word
form directly into account when determining
salience. For instance using the following con-
straint:
PRONOUN: The antecedent is a pronoun.
Effectively this constraint says that a previous
topic should be picked up. Ranking it above SUB-
JECT gives alternation between the two contexts.
The interpretation of 1-2-3 does not change, but
hij in 1-2/-3 is now resolved to Jan, as shown in
(6).

</subsectionHeader>

Smyth (1994) showed that in very restricted cases
it pays off to use the strategy pick a parallel func-
tion, in stead of pick a subject. Since Alpino gives
us information about grammatical roles, we can
formulate a parallelism constraint like the follow-
ing:
PARALLELISM: The pronoun and the antecedent
are in the same argument position.
If the pronoun is not in argument position, this
is by definition violated by every candidate, and
the constraint is rendered invisible.

5 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999333423076923">
Testing was carried out on a small corpus of
articles from the art section of the Dutch Volks-
krant newspaper. The pronouns from the target
group were hand-annotated by the author for an-
tecedents. The head of the last non-pronominal
mention of the entity a pronoun referred to, was
taken to be the antecedent. In this manner many
occurences of what normally be regarded as cat-
aphors were &apos;annotated away&apos;. Also the previous
mention might be an NP-anaphor, or a used proper
name. Neither the annotator nor the algorithm has
any information about paragraphs or other docu-
ment structure apart from sentence boundaries.
There were 222 pronouns from the target group
in the corpus. It consisted of 9 articles with a to-
tal of about 5000 words in 304 sentences. Of the
222, 13 were lost because of parsing errors from
Alpino. A score of 209/222 (94.1%) would there-
fore be the maximum.
For evaluating the output of the algorithm, two
kinds of errors were discerned. A pronoun might
be considered correctly resolved if the algorithm
coindexes it with an antecedent that, in the anno-
tation, bears the same index as the pronoun. But if
this antecedent is a pronoun itself, an error in the
resolution may have occurred earlier. This would
mean that the error is percolated up through the
chain: although the right coindexation is given, the
pronoun at the end of the chain receives the wrong
anchor, and the wrong interpretation.
In table 3 results for both ways of counting are
given. Which number is interesting depends on
the motivation of the research. For more linguis-
tically motivated projects the percolation of errors
may be not so interesting, for applications on the
other hand it is important pronouns get the right in-
terpretation (see e.g. Stuckhard (2001), for a more
elaborate discussion of counting).
To avoid ambiguities, a final constraint DIS-
TANCE was added at the lower end of every hi-
erarchy. DISTANCE gives a mark for every NP be-
tween the pronoun and the antecedent. From two
equally good candidates the nearest is alway cho-
sen.
There are several baselines in table 3: always
taking the closest candidate; taking the closest fit-
ting candidate and taking the closest fitting sub-
ject.
Looking at the upper part of the table, it is
striking that the subject baseline scores as well
as it does, confirming the observation made many
times before that subjecthood is a good indicator
for topichood. LRCOT, however performs poorly:
it does not meet the subject baseline. This is
mainly due to the fact that SENTENCE PROXIM-
ITY is too restrictive.
Adding PRONOUN gives a sharp increase in
coindexation score. The staying behind of the
anchor score for LRCOTP can be ascribed to
two things: firstly preferring pronouns means that
changes in chains are not picked up, although this
effect is being balanced by the strict SENTENCE
PROXIMITY, secondly selecting a pronoun more
often makes the chains longer, thus increasing the
chance of ending up with a wrong interpretation at
the end of the chain.
SENTENCE PROXIMITY has been replaced
from 6 onwards, by a boolean constraint MAX
5-1, that requires the antecedent to be in the cur-
rent or previous sentence. This places antecedents
in the current and previous sentence on equal foot-
ing, but penalizes coindexing with a NP farther
back.
In 6, I also introduce the operator constraint
addition, which is not part of standard OT.7 The
marks of two constraints are added to function as
7Albro (1998) uses the term mutually unranked con-
straints, but this is slightly misleading.

one integer type constraint. The harmony ranking
for PRONOUN + PARALLEL is: a parallel pro-
noun {a pronoun, a parallel item} others.
In the final rankings two more constraints are
introduced, that have been formulated on the basis
of error analysis:
HUMAN: The antecedent has a human referent.
POSSESSIVES HACK: Possessives take their an-
tecedent in the current sentence.
As can been seen in 7 and 8 in table 3 the two
constraints each only introduce slight improve-
ment, but adding them both pushes performance
to the maximum of these experiments.
The effect of HUMAN should probably be ex-
plained by the nature of the corpus. The POSS
HACK is of an ad hoc character. It was inserted
because the error analysis showed that many of
the wrongly resolved possessives had taken an an-
tecedent too far away.
This constraint is far from satisfactory, there
are examples in which the constraint is too strict,
as well as cases in which it is too loose. An
interesting approach would be to assume two
kinds of possessives: those that are topic sensi-
tive, and those that are proximity sensitive. It
is hoped that a deeper analysis of the data will
show whether there is indeed evidence for such
a distinction and whether an implementation of
the disctinction is feasible in the current frame-
work. Kameyama (1998, p103) mentions a sep-
arate treatment of all possessives based on prox-
imity. But performance decreased when using a
formulation of the Poss HACK that forced pos-
sessives to take the nearest antecedent.
The best configuration in this experiment is the
one in 9. Considering the fact that the resolution
is fully automatic,8 the coindexing score (153/222
= 68%) is promising. The anchor score (105/222
= 47,3%) is however too low for the algorithm to
be of practical use yet.

Still I would like to shortly mention two other
algorithms, to give a frame of reference.
Firstly, Mitkov et al. (2002) develop a fully au-
tomatic version of an existing knowledge-poor al-
gorithm. The algorithm is developed and tested on
a set of English computer manuals, and, although
not relying on large knowledge bases and in-depth
analysis of the input, it uses 14 factors ranging
from syntactic information to genre-specific col-
location patterns. These factors are weighted and

applied to a candidate set consisting of agreeing
and accessible possible antecedents. Also, the sys-
tem automatically filters non-nominally anaphoric
and non-anaphoric occurances of it. They achieve
an anchor score of around 60% on 2263 pronouns.
Secondly, op den Akker et al. (2002) give re-
sults on a rule-based, automatic resolution algo-
rithm for Dutch, meant for use in a text summer-
ization task. They report a recall of 69,3%, and
a precision of 73,4% for their system which uses
weighted indicating factors and shallow syntactic
information. This amounts to a coindexation score
of 50,9%, on a corpus of 440 pronouns. Signifi-
cantly, this number includes the attempts at reso-
lution of non-nominally anaphoric het.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992155">
6.2 Other anafora-related OT proposals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926354166667">
Theoretically, the system I have proposed is OT
Semantics (Hendriks and de Hoop, 2001), this
means that the hearer perspective is taken: the in-
put is a surface form (a pronoun), the output a
meaning (an antecedent). Two recent proposals
regarding OT and anaphora have taken two quite
different approaches.
In his article, Beaver (to appear) gives an OT re-
formulation of the BFP algorithm (COT). He then
extends it to a more comprehensive formalisation
of discourse coherence and anaphora resolution.
COT can be used both for production and compre-
hension of discourse.
There are seperate constraints in Beaver&apos;s sys-
tem to model salience, link salience to topicality,
and link topics to pronouns, whereas in my pro-
posal all these things are implicit in the harmony
ranking of candidates. Also there are constraints
to regulate the behaviour of other anaphoric nomi-
nals. This results in an elegant and more extensive
theory of anaphora, but at considerable costs re-
garding the character and size of Gen (/). A naive
implementation of the model would be computa-
tionally very heavy.
Recoverability Optimality Theory (ROT,
Buchwald et al. (2002)) is a type of Bidirectional
OT. Optimizing production includes optimizing
for comprehension. The surface form is then a
realisation of the intended meaning that balances
speaker economy and hearer recoverability. Input,
or intended meaning has the form: intended
salience ranking and intended logical form.
The constraints mainly link salience directly to
recoverability and penalize the use of unreduced
forms. Buchwald et al. exploit the possibility of
reranking certain constraints, to give a typology
of anaphora systems.
The three proposals share a common back-
ground (viz. CT) but differ in goals and abstract-
ness. The current state of the rather abstract ROT
is not such that one could start analysing complex
sentences and discourse with it. And, although
Beaver&apos;s model can be used for this, its complex-
ity prevents us from using it on a larger scale. My
system, finally, can easily be used on a large cor-
pus, but &amp;quot;analysis&amp;quot; is restricted to the resolution
of pronouns; it does not offer the explanations or
even the level of description, the former two do.

7 Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.999771259259259">
I have presented an implementation of an auto-
matic pronoun resolution system for Dutch. Using
Optimality Theory, the system remains clear and
intuitive, whilst allowing me to start modelling the
complex behaviour of pronouns.
On the application front, results are still bleak.
On the linguistic side, however, developing the
programme and error analysis have already given
interesting hints for further research: the use of het
in Dutch, the influence of humanhood on salience,
and the peculiar behaviour of possessives.
In the experiments presented here, the ba-
sic salience determiner was obliqueness.
Strube and Hahn (1999) have argued that in-
formation status is a more appropriate measure for
salience, especially for free-word-order languages
like German. It would be interesting to compare
the predictions made by standard Centering and
s.c. Functional Centering for Dutch, but even
though an OT formulation of Strube&apos;s incremen-
tal Functional CT algorithm (Strube, 1998) is
straightforward to give,9 information status of
an entity is complicated to compute. It could
be approximated by using the typical NP-forms
instead.
Other research directions include: analysis of
plural pronouns and plural antecedents — there is

no solution for conjunctions and split antecedents
at the moment — and reference to implicitly real-
ized entities. In connection to the latter, the Func-
tional Centering framework is interesting, too,
since it provides us with a principled way of deal-
ing with indirect reference.
Finally, it would be interesting to see if a hy-
brid between my system and Beaver&apos;s model could
be made: an incremental algorithm with a limited
backtracking ability. The amount of backtracking
necessary could then itself be a measure of the co-
herence of a discourse.

In this paper I will use the framework of Optimality Theory to implement an automatic pronoun resolution system for Dutch. By ranking constraints, Optimality Theory can be used to model complex behaviour and preferences, whilst keeping the constraints clear and simple. The system is developed by quantative evaluation of different configurations on a small corpus of newspaper articles, containing 222 pronouns. Even though, from a practical perspective, the performance is wanting, some linguistically interesting results are given.</abstract>

Beaver (to appear)). 4.3 Topichood Normally pronouns refer to salient entities, or even: to the topic. How salience should be measured and how to determine what the topic is, is a central issue in many approaches to pronoun resolution of realworld texts. Centering Theory (CT, Grosz et al. (1995)) links specific definitions of topic (&apos;backwardlooking center&apos;) and salience (&apos;forward-looking center list&apos;), to model coherence. Utterances yield salience rankings of entities after grammatical function. The topic of an utterance is the most salient entity of the previous utterance that is realised in the current one. Moreover, CT says that if there are pronouns in a sentence, one of them should realize the topic. If we regard the salience ranking in CT — subject objects other — as a harmony ranking, we can formulate it in constraints. The constraint ranking SUBJECT &gt; OBJECT realizes this. T</context>

The impact of the use of different resources, having different target classes, training and testing on different corpora and, most of all, working with a different language makes comparison practically impossible. Still I would like to shortly mention two other algorithms, to give a frame of reference. Firstly, Mitkov et al. (2002) develop a fully automatic version of an existing knowledge-poor algorithm. The algorithm is developed and tested on a set of English computer manuals, and, although not relying on large knowledge bases and in-depth analysis of the input, it uses 14 factors ranging from syntactic information to genre-specific collocation patterns. These factors are weighted and 8About 15 coindexation errors are directly due to Alpino, but it is hard to predict what the impact would be of using fully corrected parses 20 applied to a candidate set consisting of agreeing and accessible possible antecedents.

This syntactic information is needed at several points in the resolution process, from identifying the pronouns to determining agreement values and salience rankings In pronoun resolution there is typically a division in the factors between rules and preferences. The divide between the two is not clear cut. Some preferences are strongly preferred over others, wereas some rules maybe should be allowed to be broken every once and a while. In Optimality Theory (0T, Prince and Smolensky (2002)) the total interaction of rules and preferences is modeled by assuming soft-constraints that are ranked. The strict ranking, as opposed to, say, a weighting of constraints, means the system stays conceptually clear. First I will give a short description of the pronouns that are resolved. Then after giving a description of the algorithm and introducing the constraints that are used, I will discuss the results of testing several configurations on a small corpus. 2 Target Pronouns The pronouns to be resolved by the algorithm are the third person personal and possessive pronouns, as listed in tab</context>

This would mean that the error is percolated up through the chain: although the right coindexation is given, the pronoun at the end of the chain receives the wrong anchor, and the wrong interpretation. In table 3 results for both ways of counting are given. Which number is interesting depends on the motivation of the research. For more linguistically motivated projects the percolation of errors may be not so interesting, for applications on the other hand it is important pronouns get the right interpretation (see e.g. Stuckhard (2001), for a more elaborate discussion of counting). To avoid ambiguities, a final constraint DISTANCE was added at the lower end of every hierarchy. DISTANCE gives a mark for every NP between the pronoun and the antecedent. From two equally good candidates the nearest is alway chosen. There are several baselines in table 3: always taking the closest candidate; taking the closest fitting candidate and taking the closest fitting subject. Looking at the upper part of the table, it is striking that the subject baseline scores as well as it does, confirming the observation made many times before that s</context>

Check for each candidate which constraints it satisfies, and which not. 3. Calculate the harmony ranking of candidates, i.e. how well each candidate satisfies the constraints, taking into account that satisfying certain constraints is more important than satisfying others. The most harmonic candidate (the optimal one), is selected as the output. Several computational problems arise for OT, mainly concerning the construction and the size of Gen(/). There are various ingenious solutions to these and other problems (Tesar, 1995; Gerdemann and van Noord, 2000). However, the application of these solutions to the type of system I am proposing here, is not very straightforward. Rather, by making some limiting assumptions, the abstract OT system above can be implemented almost directly: ad / The input of the system is a partial FS containing syntactical information on the pronoun to be resolved P. The output is an antecedent for P and Gen(P) therefore is the stack with FS&apos;s of possible antecedents, A, which is composed incrementally. The stacksize is (somewhat arbitrarily) set to 20. Increasing the size has no influence </context>

The topic of an utterance is the most salient entity of the previous utterance that is realised in the current one. Moreover, CT says that if there are pronouns in a sentence, one of them should realize the topic. If we regard the salience ranking in CT — subject objects other — as a harmony ranking, we can formulate it in constraints. The constraint ranking SUBJECT &gt; OBJECT realizes this. The two constraints can be characterized as: SUBJECT/OBJECT: The entity is realized in subject/object position. An incremental, CT based algorithm is LeftRight Centering (LRC, Tetreault (2001)). On encountering a pronoun, the LRC algorithm looks through the list of discourse entities it has come across in the current sentence. The first entity that meets agreement and binding constraints is selected. If no such is found, it starts looking at the salience ranking from the previous utterance, etc. Assuming that the same criteria apply to the partial salience ranking of the current sentence, as do to the ranking of previous ones, an implementation of LRC in OT — LRCOT for short — can be given. The two function constraints are ranked below: SENTENTIAL PROXIMITY: Don&apos;t have a sentence b</context>
