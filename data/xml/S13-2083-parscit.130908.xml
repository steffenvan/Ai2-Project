This paper describes the specifications and re-
sults of SSA-UO, unsupervised system, pre-
sented in SemEval 2013 for Sentiment Analy-
sis in Twitter (Task 2) (Wilson et al., 2013).
The proposal system includes three phases:
data preprocessing, contextual word polarity
detection and message classification. The
preprocessing phase comprises treatment of
emoticon, slang terms, lemmatization and
POS-tagging. Word polarity detection is car-
ried out taking into account the sentiment as-
sociated with the context in which it appears.
For this, we use a new contextual sentiment
classification method based on coarse-grained
word sense disambiguation, using WordNet
(Miller, 1995) and a coarse-grained sense in-
ventory (sentiment inventory) built up from
SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010). Fi-
nally, the overall sentiment is determined us-
ing a rule-based classifier. As it may be ob-
served, the results obtained for Twitter and
SMS sentiment classification are good consid-
ering that our proposal is unsupervised.

The explosion of Web 2.0 has marked a new age
for the human society. The huge use of Social Me-
dia such as Facebook1 , MySpace2 , LinkedIn3 and
Twitter4 , offers a place for people to share informa-
tion in real time. Twitter is one of the most popular

social network websites and has been growing at a
very fast pace. The number of active users exceeds
500 million and the number of tweets posted by day
exceeds 500 million (as of May 2012)5. Through the
twitter applications, users shared opinions about per-
sonalities, politicians, products, companies, events,
etc. This has been attracting the attention of dif-
ferent research communities interested in analyz-
ing its content and motivated many natural language
tasks, such as sentiment analysis, emotions detec-
tion, opinions retrieval, product recommendation or
opinion summarization.
One of the most popular sentiment analysis tasks
is polarity classification. This task is a new field
that classifies opinion texts as positive, negative or
neutral (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Esuli and
Sebastiani, 2006; Wilson et al., 2006; Wiegand et
al., 2010). Determining polarity might seem an easy
task, as many words have some polarity by them-
selves. However, words do not always express the
same sentiment, and in most cases the polarity of a
word depends on the context in which the word is
used. So, terms that clearly denote negative feel-
ings can be neutral, or even positive, depending
on their context. Hence, sentiment analysis sys-
tems should include semantic-level analysis in order
to solve word ambiguity and correctly capture the
meaning of each word according to its context. Also,
complex linguistic processing is needed to deal with
problems such as the effect of negations and infor-
mal language. Moreover, understanding the senti-
mental meaning of the different textual units is im-
portant to accurately determine the overall polarity

In this paper, we present a system that has as main
objective to analyze the sentiments of tweets and
classify these as positive, negative or neutral. The
proposal system includes three phases: data prepro-
cessing, contextual word polarity detection and mes-
sage classification. The preprocessing phase com-
prises treatment of emoticons, spell-errors, slang
terms, lemmatization and POS-tagging. Word po-
larity detection is carried out taking into account the
sentiment associated with the context within which
it appears. For this, we use a new contextual senti-
ment classification method based on coarse-grained
word sense disambiguation, using WordNet (Miller,
1995) and a coarse-grained sense inventory (senti-
ment inventory) built up from SentiWordNet (Bac-
cianella et al., 2010). Finally, the polarity is deter-
mined using a rule-based classifier. The paper is
organized as follows. Section 2 describes of SSA-
UO system. In Section 3 we evaluate our proposal
and discuss the results obtained in the SemEval 2013
Task No. 2. Finally, section 4 provides concluding
remarks.

<bodyText confidence="0.999829272727273">
We use an unsupervised strategy consisting in a
coarse-grained clustering-based word sense disam-
biguation (WSD) method that differentiates positive,
negative, highly positive, highly negative and objec-
tive uses of every word on context which it occurs.
The proposal method uses WordNet and a coarse-
grained sense inventory (sentiment inventory) built
up from SentiWordNet. The overall architecture of
our sentiment classifier is shown in Figure 1.
Firstly, data preprocessing is done to eliminate in-
complete, noisy or inconsistent information. A Sen-
timent Word Sense Disambiguation method (Section
2.3) is then applied to content words (nouns, adjec-
tives, verbs and adverbs). Once all content words
are disambiguated, we apply a rule-based classifier
(Section 2.4) to decide whether the tweet is positive,
negative or neutral.
Unsupervised word sense disambiguation method
proposed by (Anaya-S´anchez et al., 2006) was
adapted for sentiment word sense disambiguation.
Unlike the authors, who aim to obtain the correct
sense of a word, we use the method to determine

when a word is used with highly positive (HP), posi-
tive (P), highly negative (HN), negative (N) or objec-
tive (O) meaning based on a sentiment sense inven-
tory. We make sentiment sense inventory based on
sense-level annotation in SentiWordNet. Finally, we
apply a rule-based classifier to determine the overall
sentiment in tweet.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999976">
The tweets differ from the text in articles, books, or
even spoken language. It is limited to 140 charac-
ters, also includes many idiosyncratic uses, such as
emoticons, slang terms, misspellings, URLs, “RT”
for re-tweet, “@” for user mentions, “#” for hash-
tags, and character repetitions. Therefore it is nec-
essary to preprocess the text, in order to reduce the
noise information. The preprocessing step involve
the following task. The text is tokenized and URL,
re-tweets and author mentions are removed. Hash-
tag tokens frequently contain relevant information
related to the topic of the tweet, this is included as
part of the text but without the “#” character. We
replace emoticon tokens by emotion words using
an emoticons dictionary, obtained from Wikipedia

6. Each emoticon was manually annotated with an
emotion word and polarity value. Emoticons that
suggest positive emotions - “:-)”, “:)”, “X-D” - are
annotated with the emotion word “happy” and neg-
ative emoticons - “:-(”, “:-c”, “:,(” - are annotated
with the emotion word “sad”. The presence of ab-
breviations within a tweet is noted, therefore abbre-
viations are replaced by their meaning (e.g., LOL –
laughing out loud) using a dictionary7. Finally the
text is POS-tagged and lemmatized using TreeTag-
ger (Schmid, 1994) and stopwords are discarded.

2.2 Sentiment Sense Inventory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999835055555556">
We considered SentiWordNet for building senti-
ment coarse-grained sense inventory. SentiWordNet
contain positive, negative and objective scores be-
tween 0 and 1 for all senses in WordNet. Based
on this sense level annotation, we define a new
rule (SentiS) for classifying senses in five sentiment
class. The senses are classified in the following man-
ner (Alexandra et al., 2009): senses whose positive
score is greater than or equal to 0.75 are consid-
ered to be highly positive (HP), senses with posi-
tive score greater than or equal to 0.5 and lower than
0.75 are considered positive (P), senses with nega-
tive score greater than or equal 0.75 are considered
highly negative (HN), whereas those whose negative
score is lower than 0.75 and greater than or equal to
0.5 are considered to be negative (N). In the remain-
ing cases, the senses are considered to be objective
(O) (see equation(1)).

Table 1 summarizes the distribution of the five
sentiment classes once classified all senses of Sen-
tiWordNet.
A notable unbalance can be observed between the
number of highly positive, highly negative, positive,
negative and objective senses.

Once all senses were classified in a five sentiment
sense class, we create a coarse sense inventory based
on this classification. This inventory is defined in the
following manner: For each word in SentiWordNet
we grouped its senses with the same sentiment class
in a single sense (coarse-sense), in case of objective
senses these are kept separated.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998427">
2.3 Contextual Word Polarity Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.952870931034483">
Much work on sentiment analysis have been di-
rected to determine the polarity of opinion using
anotated lexicons with prior polarity (Hatzivas-
siloglou and McKeown, 1997; Kamps and Marx,
2002; Turney, 2002). However a word can mod-
ify your prior polarity in relation to the context
within which it is invoked. For example the word
“earthquake” is used with negative meaning in the
sentence :
“Selling the company caused an earthquake amount
the employees”.
Whereas it is used in an neutral meaning in the
sentence:
“An earthquake is the result of a sudden release of
energy in the Earth’s crust that creates seismic waves”.
For this reason, our system uses a coarse-grained
WSD method for obtaining the contextual polarity
of all words in tweets. The selected disambigua-
tion method (Anaya-S´anchez et al., 2006) was de-
veloped for the traditional WSD task. In this WSD
method, the senses are represented as topic signa-
tures (Lin and Hovy, 2000) built from the repository
of concepts of WordNet. The disambiguation pro-
cess starts from a clustering distribution of all pos-
sible senses of the ambiguous words by applying
the Extended Star clustering algorithm (Gil-Garc´ıa
et al., 2003). Such a clustering tries to identify co-
hesive groups of word senses, which are assumed
to represent different meanings for the set of words.

Then, clusters that match the best with the context
are selected. If the selected clusters disambiguate
all words, the process stops and the senses belong-
ing to the selected clusters are interpreted as the dis-
ambiguating ones. Otherwise, the clustering is per-
formed again (regarding the remaining senses) until
a complete disambiguation is achieved. It does not
distinguish between highly positive, positive, nega-
tive, highly negative or objective meaning of a word.
In this paper, we propose a strategy to built a coarse-
grained sense representation. Firstly, a topic signa-
tures for all senses into WordNet is built and the
topic signatures for coarse-grained senses is the sum
of the topic signatures of the corresponding fine-
grained senses that was grouped.
We explain coarse-grained sense representation
using the following example:
Let us consider the adjective “sad”. This adjec-
tive has three word senses into WordNet 2.0
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.832974">
sad#a#1 – experiencing or showing sorrow or unhappiness
sad#a#2 – of things that make you feel sad
sad#a#3 – bad; unfortunate
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998345">
signed to each word, based on equation 2, after these
were disambiguated. It is necessary to clarify that
emotion words that replaced emoticons in the pre-
processing phase, are not disambiguated. Instead,
we give a prior polarity value equal to 4 if emotion
word is “happy” and -4 in case that emotion word is
“sad”. It is important to mention that the polarity of
a word is forced into the opposite class if it is pre-
ceded by a valence shifter (obtained from the Negate
category in GI (Stone et al., 1966)).

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982792">
The polarity of the tweet is determined from the
scores of positive and negative words it contains. To
sum up, for each tweet the overall positive (PosS(t))
value and overall negative value (NegS(t)) , are com-
puted as:

The general operation of the algorithm is illustrated
in the following example:
Let us consider the following tweet:

<bodyText confidence="0.912599764705882">
After applying the preprocessing phase, we
obtain the following normalized text:
Afterward we compute overall positive and negative
polarity value:
I really love Jennifer Aniston “happy” loving, she
is very cooll and sexy. I’m married to her... lots of laughs.
When the text is lemmatized and stopwords are
removed, we obtain the following bag of words (for
each word we show: lemma and part-of-speech n-
noun, v-verb, a-adjective, r-adverb and u-unknown):
really#r love#v jennifer#a aniston#n “happy”#a
loving#a cooll#a sexy#a marry#v lot#n laugh#n.
After contextual word polarity detection, we
obtain the following result (for each word we
shown lemma, part-of-speech and sentiment sense,
HP-highly positive, HN-highly negative, P-positive,
N-negative and O-objective).

In this paper, we have described the SSA-UO system

<abstract confidence="0.995864416666667">This paper describes the specifications and results of SSA-UO, unsupervised system, presented in SemEval 2013 for Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Task 2) (Wilson et al., 2013). The proposal system includes three phases: data preprocessing, contextual word polarity detection and message classification. The preprocessing phase comprises treatment of emoticon, slang terms, lemmatization and POS-tagging. Word polarity detection is carried out taking into account the sentiment associated with the context in which it appears. For this, we use a new contextual sentiment classification method based on coarse-grained word sense disambiguation, using WordNet (Miller, 1995) and a coarse-grained sense inventory (sentiment inventory) built up from SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010). Finally, the overall sentiment is determined using a rule-based classifier. As it may be observed, the results obtained for Twitter and SMS sentiment classification are good considering that our proposal is unsupervised.</abstract>

Through the twitter applications, users shared opinions about personalities, politicians, products, companies, events, etc. This has been attracting the attention of different research communities interested in analyzing its content and motivated many natural language tasks, such as sentiment analysis, emotions detection, opinions retrieval, product recommendation or opinion summarization. One of the most popular sentiment analysis tasks is polarity classification. This task is a new field that classifies opinion texts as positive, negative or neutral (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Wilson et al., 2006; Wiegand et al., 2010). Determining polarity might seem an easy task, as many words have some polarity by themselves. However, words do not always express the same sentiment, and in most cases the polarity of a word depends on the context in which the word is used. So, terms that clearly denote negative feelings can be neutral, or even positive, depending on their context. Hence, sentiment analysis systems should include semantic-level analysis in order to solve word ambiguity and correctly capture the meaning of each word according to its context.

For this reason, our system uses a coarse-grained WSD method for obtaining the contextual polarity of all words in tweets. The selected disambiguation method (Anaya-S´anchez et al., 2006) was developed for the traditional WSD task. In this WSD method, the senses are represented as topic signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000) built from the repository of concepts of WordNet. The disambiguation process starts from a clustering distribution of all possible senses of the ambiguous words by applying the Extended Star clustering algorithm (Gil-Garc´ıa et al., 2003). Such a clustering tries to identify cohesive groups of word senses, which are assumed to represent different meanings for the set of words.

Emoticons that suggest positive emotions - “:-)”, “:)”, “X-D” - are annotated with the emotion word “happy” and negative emoticons - “:-(”, “:-c”, “:,(” - are annotated with the emotion word “sad”. The presence of abbreviations within a tweet is noted, therefore abbreviations are replaced by their meaning (e.g., LOL – laughing out loud) using a dictionary7. Finally the text is POS-tagged and lemmatized using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) and stopwords are discarded. 2.2 Sentiment Sense Inventory We considered SentiWordNet for building sentiment coarse-grained sense inventory. SentiWordNet contain positive, negative and objective scores between 0 and 1 for all senses in WordNet. Based on this sense level annotation, we define a new rule (SentiS) for classifying senses in five sentiment class.

For this reason, our system uses a coarse-grained WSD method for obtaining the contextual polarity of all words in tweets. The selected disambiguation method (Anaya-S´anchez et al., 2</context>

One of the most popular sentiment analysis tasks is polarity classification. This task is a new field that classifies opinion texts as positive, negative or neutral (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Wilson et al., 2006; Wiegand et al., 2010). Determining polarity might seem an easy task, as many words have some polarity by themselves. However, words do not always express the same sentiment, and in most cases the polarity of a word depends on the context in which the word is used. So, terms that clearly denote negative feelings can be neutral, or even positive, depending on their context. Hence, sentiment analysis systems should include semantic-level analysis in order to solve word ambiguity and correctly capture the meaning of each word according to its context. Also, complex linguistic processing is needed to deal with problems</context>
