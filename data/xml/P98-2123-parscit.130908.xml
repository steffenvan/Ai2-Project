Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999568928571429">
In this paper we present Morphy, an inte-
grated tool for German morphology, part-of-
speech tagging and context-sensitive lem-
matization. Its large lexicon of more than
320,000 word forms plus its ability to pro-
cess German compound nouns guarantee a
wide morphological coverage. Syntactic
ambiguities can be resolved with a standard
statistical part-of-speech tagger. By using
the output of the tagger, the lemmatizer can
determine the correct root even for ambi-
guous word forms. The complete package is
freely available and can be downloaded
from the World Wide Web.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997634883721">
Morphological analysis is the basis for many
NLP applications, including syntax parsing,
machine translation and automatic indexing.
However, most morphology systems are com-
ponents of commercial products. Often, as for
example in machine translation, these systems
are presented as black boxes, with the morpho-
logical analysis only used internally. This makes
them unsuitable for research purposes. To our
knowledge, the only wide coverage morpho-
logical lexicon readily available is for the Eng-
lish language (Karp, Schabes, et al., 1992).
There have been attempts to provide free mor-
phological analyzers to the research community
for other languages, for example in the
MULTEXT project (Armstrong, Russell, et al.,
1995), which developed linguistic tools for six
European languages. However, the lexicons
provided are rather small for most languages. In
the case of German, we hope to significantly
improve this situation with the development of a
new version of our morphological analyzer
Morphy.
In addition to the morphological analyzer,
Morphy includes a statistical part-of-speech tag-
ger and a context-sensitive lemmatizer. It can be
downloaded from our web site as a complete
package including documentation and lexicon
(http://www-psycho.uni-paderborn.de/lezius/).
The lexicon comprises 324,000 word forms
based on 50,500 stems. Its completeness has
been checked using Wahrig Deutsches Worter-
buch, a standard dictionary of German (Wahrig,
1997). Since Morphy is intended not only for
linguists, but also for second language learners
of German, the current version has been imple-
mented with Delphi for a standard Windows 95
or Windows NT platform and great effort has
been put in making it as user friendly as possi-
ble. For UNIX users, an export facility is pro-
vided which allows generating a lexicon of full
forms together with their morphological de-
scriptions in text format.

1 The Morphology System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954602">
Since German is a highly inflectional language,
the morphological algorithms used in Morphy
are rather complex and can not be described here
in detail (see Lezius, 1996). In essence, Morphy
is a computer implementation of the morpho-
logical system described in the Duden grammar
(Drosdowsky, 1984).
An overview on other German morphology
systems, namely GERTWOL, LA-Morph,
Morph, Morphix, Morphy, MPRO, PC-Kimmo

and Plain, is given in the documentation for the
Morpholympics (Hausser, 1996). The Morpho-
lympics were an attempt to compare and evalu-
ate morphology systems in a standardized com-
petition. Since then, many of the systems have
been further developed. The version of Morphy
as described here is a new release. Improve-
ments over the old version include an integrated
part-of-speech tagger, a context-sensitive lem-
matizer, a 2.5 times larger lexicon and more
user-friendliness through an interactive Win-
dows-environment.
The following subsections describe the three
submodules of the morphological analyzer.
These are the lexical system, the generation
module and the analysis module.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999586">
1.1 Lexical System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999943">
The lexicon of Morphy is very compact as it
only stores the base form for each word together
with its inflection class. Therefore, the complete
morphological information for 324,000 word
forms takes less than 2 Megabytes of disk space.
In comparison, the text representation of the
same lexicon, which can be generated via Mor-
phy&apos;s export facility, requires 125 MB when full
morphological descriptions are given.
Since the lexical system has been specifically
designed to allow a user-friendly extension of
the lexicon, new words can be added easily. To
our knowledge, Morphy is the only morphology
system for German whose lexicon can be ex-
panded by users who have no specialist know-
ledge. When entering a new word, the user is
asked the minimal number of questions neces-
sary to infer the grammatical features of the new
word and which any native speaker of German
should be able to answer.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.966425">
1.2 Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999338">
Starting from the root form of a word and its
inflection type as stored in the lexicon, the gen-
eration system produces all inflected forms.
Morphy&apos;s generation algorithms were designed
with the aim of producing 100% correct output.
Among other morphological characteristics, the
algorithms consider vowel mutation (Haus -
Hauser), shift between B and ss (FaB - Fasser), e-
omission (segeln - segle), infixation of infinitive
markers (weggehen - wegzugehen), as well as
pre- and infixation of markers of participles
(gehen - gegangen; weggehen - weggegangen).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997827">
1.3 Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999633653846154">
For each word form of a text, the analysis sys-
tem determines its root, part of speech, and - if
appropriate - its gender, case, number, person,
tense, and comparative degree. It also segments
compound nouns using a longest-matching rule
which works from right to left and takes linking
letters into account. To compound German
nouns is not trivial: it can involve base forms
and/or inflected forms (e.g. Haus-meister but
Hauser-meer); in some cases the compounding
is morphologically ambiguous (e.g. Stau-becken
means water reservoir, but Staub-ecken means
dust corners); and the linking letters e and s are
not always determined phonologically, but in
some cases simply occur by convention (e.g.
Schwein-e-bauch but Schwein-s-blase and
Schwein-kram).
Since the analysis system treats each word
separately, ambiguities can not be resolved at
this stage. For ambiguous word forms, all pos-
sible lemmata and their morphological descrip-
tions are given (see Table 1 for the example
Winde). If a word form can not be recognized,
its part of speech is predicted by a guesser which
makes use of statistical data derived from Ger-
man suffix frequencies (Rapp, 1996).

Morphy&apos;s algorithm for analysis is motivated
by linguistic considerations. When analyzing a
word form, Morphy first builds up a list of pos-
sible roots by cutting off all possible prefixes
and suffixes and reverses the process of vowel
mutation if umlauts are found (shifts between B
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999958571428572">
and ss are treated analogously). Each root is
looked up in the lexicon, and - if found - all
possible inflected forms are generated. Only
those roots which lead to an inflected form
identical to the original word form are selected
(Lezius, 1996).
Naturally, this procedure is much slower than
a simple algorithm for the lookup of word forms
in a full form lexicon. It results in an analysis
speed of about 300 word forms per second on a
fast PC, compared to many thousands using a
full form lexicon. However, there are also ad-
vantages: First, as mentioned above, the lexicon
can be kept very small, which is an important
consideration for a PC-based system intended
for Internet-distribution. More importantly, the
processing of German compound nouns and the
implementation of derivation rules - although
only partially completed at this stage - fits better
into this concept. For the processing of very
large corpora under UNIX, we have imple-
mented a lookup algorithm which operates on
the Morphy-generated full form lexicon.
The coverage of the current version of Mor-
phy was evaluated with the same test corpus that
had been used at the Morpholympics. This cor-
pus comprises about 7.800 word forms in total
and consists of two political speeches, a frag-
ment of the LIMAS-corpus, and a list of special
word forms. The present version of Morphy
recognized 94.3%, 98.4%, 96.2%, and 88.9% of
the word forms respectively. The corresponding
values for the old version of Morphy, with a 2.5
times smaller lexicon, had been 89.2%, 95.9%,
86.9%, and 75.8%.

2 The Disambiguator
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994875">
Since the morphology system only looks at iso-
lated word forms, words with more than one
reading can not be disambiguated. This is done
by the disambiguator or tagger, which takes
context into account by considering the condi-
tional probabilities of tag sequences. For exam-
ple, in the sentence &amp;quot;he opens the can&amp;quot; the verb-
reading of can may be ruled out because a verb
can not follow an article.
After the success of statistical part-of-speech
taggers for English, there have been quite a few
attempts to apply the same methods to German.
Lezius, Rapp &amp; Wettler (1996) give an overview
on some German tagging projects. Although we
considered a number of algorithms, we decided
to use the trigram algorithm described by
Church (1988) for tagging. It is simple, fast,
robust, and - among the statistical taggers - still
more or less unsurpassed in terms of accuracy.
Conceptually, the Church-algorithm works as
follows: For each sentence of a text, it generates
all possible assignments of part-of-speech tags
to words. It then selects that assignment which
optimizes the product of the lexical and contex-
tual probabilities. The lexical probability for
word N is the probability of observing part of
speech X given the (possibly ambiguous) word
N. The contextual probability for tag Z is the
probability of observing part of speech Z given
the preceding two parts of speech X and Y. It is
estimated by dividing the trigram frequency
XYZ by the bigram frequency XY. In practice,
computational limitations do not allow the enu-
meration of all possible assignments for long
sentences, and smoothing is required for infre-
quent events. This is described in more detail in
the original publication (Church, 1988).
Although more sophisticated algorithms for
unsupervised learning - which can be trained on
plain text instead on manually tagged corpora -
are well established (see e.g. Merialdo, 1994),
we decided not to use them. The main reason is
that with large tag sets, the sparse-data-problem
can become so severe that unsupervised training
easily ends up in local minima, which can lead
to poor results without any indication to the user.
More recently, in contrast to the statistical tag-
gers, rule-based tagging algorithms have been
suggested which were shown to reduce the error
rate significantly (Samuelsson &amp; Voutilainen,
1997). We consider this a promising approach
and have started to develop such a system for
German with the intention of later inclusion into
Morphy.
The tag set of Morphy&apos;s tagger is based on the
feature system of the morphological analyzer.
However, some features were discarded for tag-
ging. For example, the tense of verbs is not con-
sidered. This results in a set of about 1000 dif-
ferent tags. A fragment of 20,000 words from
the Frankfurter Rundschau Corpus, which we
have been collecting since 1992, was tagged
with this tag set by manually selecting the cor-
rect choice from the set of possibilities generated
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996626">
745
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971269230769">
by the morphological analyzer. In the following
we refer to this corpus as the training corpus. Of
all possible tags, only 456 actually occurred in
the training corpus. The average ambiguity rate
was 5.4 tags per word form.
The performance of our tagger was evaluated
by running it on a 5000-word test sample of the
Frankfurter Rundschau-Corpus which was di-
stinct from the training text. We also tagged the
test sample manually and compared the results.
84.7% of the tags were correctly tagged. Al-
though this result may seem poor at first glance,
it should be noted that the large tag sets have
many fine distinctions which lead to a high error
rate. If a tag set does not have these distinctions,
the accuracy improves significantly. In order to
show this, in another experiment we mapped our
large tag set to a smaller set of 51 tags, which is
comparable to the tag set used in the Brown
Corpus (Greene &amp; Rubin, 1971). As a result, the
average ambiguity rate per word decreased from
5.4 to 1.6, and the accuracy improved to 95.9%,
which is similar to the accuracy rates reported
for statistical taggers with small tag sets in vari-
ous other languages. Table 2 shows a tagging
example for the large and the small tag set.

3 The Lemmatizer
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993909375">
For lemmatization (the reduction to base form),
the integrated design of Morphy turned out to be
advantageous. In the first step, the morphology-
module delivers all possible lemmata for each
word form. Secondly, the tagger determines the
grammatical categories of the word forms. If, for
any of the lemmata, the inflected form corre-
sponding to the word form in the text does not
agree with this grammatical category, the re-
spective lemma is discarded. For example, in the
sentence &amp;quot;ich meine meine Frau&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;I mean my
wife&amp;quot;), the assignment of the two middle words
to the verb meinen and the possessive pronoun
mein is not clear to the morphology system.
However, since the tagger assigns the tag se-
quence &amp;quot;pronoun verb pronoun noun&amp;quot; to this
sentence, it can be concluded that the first oc-
currence of meine must refer to the verb meinen
and the second to the pronoun mein.
Unfortunately, this may not always work as
well as in this example. One reason is that there
may be semantic ambiguities which can not be
resolved by syntactic considerations. Another is
that the syntactic information delivered by the
tagger may not be fine grained enough to resolve
all syntactic ambiguities.&apos; Do we need the fine
grained distinctions of the large tag set to re-
solve ambiguities, or does the rough information
from the small tag set suffice? To address these
questions, we performed an evaluation using
another test sample from the Frankfurter Rund-
schau-Corpus.
We found that - according to the Morphy lexi-
con - of all 9,893 word forms in the sample,
9,198 (93.0%) had an unambiguous lemma. Of
the remaining 695 word forms, 667 had two
possible lemmata and 28 were threefold ambi-
guous (Table 3 gives some examples). Using the
large tag set, 616 out of the 695 ambiguous word
forms were correctly lemmatized (88.6%). The
corresponding figures for the small tag set were
slightly better: 625 out of 695 ambiguities were
resolved correctly (89.9%). When the error-rate
is related to the total number of word forms in
the text, the accuracy is 99.2% for the large and
99.3% for the small tag set.
The better performance when using the small
tag set is somewhat surprising since there are a
few cases of ambiguities in the test corpus which
can only be resolved by the large tag set but not
by the small tag set. For example, since the
small tag set does not consider a noun&apos;s case,
gender, and number, it can not decide whether
Filmen is derived from der Film (&amp;quot;the film&amp;quot;) or
from das Filmen (&amp;quot;the filming&amp;quot;). On the other
hand, as shown in the previous section, the tag-
ging accuracy is much better for the small tag
set, which is an advantage in lemmatization and
obviously compensates for the lack of detail.
I For example the verb fiihren can be either a sub-
junctive form offahren (&amp;quot;to drive&amp;quot;) or a regular form
of fiihren (&amp;quot;to lead&amp;quot;). Since neither the large nor the
small tag set consider mood, this ambiguity can not
be resolved.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996029">
746
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9866095">
However, we believe that with future improve-
ments in tagging accuracy lemmatization based
on the large tag set will eventually be better.
Nevertheless, the current implementation of the
lemmatizer gives the user the choice of selecting
between either tag set.

In this paper, a freely available integrated tool
for German morphological analysis, part-of-
speech tagging and context sensitive lemmatiza-
tion was introduced. The morphological ana-
lyzer is based on the standard Duden grammar
and provides wide coverage due to a lexicon of
324,000 word forms and the ability to process
compound nouns at runtime. It gives for each
word form of a text all possible lemmata and
morphological descriptions. The ambiguities of
the morphological descriptions are resolved by
the tagger, which provides about 85% accuracy
for the large and 96% accuracy for the small tag
set. The lemmatizer uses the output of the tagger
to disambiguate word forms with more than one
possible lemma. It achieves an overall accuracy
of about 99.3%.

By using the output of the tagger, the lemmatizer can determine the correct root even for ambiguous word forms. The complete package is freely available and can be downloaded from the World Wide Web.</abstract>

This is done by the disambiguator or tagger, which takes context into account by considering the conditional probabilities of tag sequences. For example, in the sentence &amp;quot;he opens the can&amp;quot; the verbreading of can may be ruled out because a verb can not follow an article. After the success of statistical part-of-speech taggers for English, there have been quite a few attempts to apply the same methods to German. Lezius, Rapp &amp; Wettler (1996) give an overview on some German tagging projects. Although we considered a number of algorithms, we decided to use the trigram algorithm described by Church (1988) for tagging. It is simple, fast, robust, and - among the statistical taggers - still more or less unsurpassed in terms of accuracy. Conceptually, the Church-algorithm works as follows: For each sentence of a text, it generates all possible assignments of part-of-speech tags to words. It then selects that assignment which optimizes the product of the lexical and contextual probabilities. The lexical probability for word N is the probability of observing part of speech X given the (possibly ambiguous) word N. The contextual probability for tag Z is the probability of observing part of speech Z </context>

We also tagged the test sample manually and compared the results. 84.7% of the tags were correctly tagged. Although this result may seem poor at first glance, it should be noted that the large tag sets have many fine distinctions which lead to a high error rate. If a tag set does not have these distinctions, the accuracy improves significantly. In order to show this, in another experiment we mapped our large tag set to a smaller set of 51 tags, which is comparable to the tag set used in the Brown Corpus (Greene &amp; Rubin, 1971). As a result, the average ambiguity rate per word decreased from 5.4 to 1.6, and the accuracy improved to 95.9%, which is similar to the accuracy rates reported for statistical taggers with small tag sets in various other languages.

Morphy&apos;s algorithm for analysis is motivated by linguistic considerations. When analyzing a word form, Morphy first builds up a list of possible roots by cutting off all possible prefixes and suffixes and reverses the process of vowel mutation if umlauts are found (shifts between B 744 and ss are treated analogously). Each root is looked up in the lexicon, and - if found - all possible inflected forms are generated. Only those roots which lead to an inflected form identical to the original word form are selected (Lezius, 1996). Naturally, this procedure is much slower than a simple algorithm for the lookup of word forms in a full form lexicon. It results in an analysis speed of about 300 word forms per second on a fast PC, compared to many thousands using a full form lexicon. However, there are also advantages: First, as mentioned above, the lexicon can be kept very small, which is an important consideration for a PC-based system intended for Internet-distribution. More importantly, the processing of German compound nouns and the implementation of derivation rules - although only partially completed at this stage -</context>

It is estimated by dividing the trigram frequency XYZ by the bigram frequency XY. In practice, computational limitations do not allow the enumeration of all possible assignments for long sentences, and smoothing is required for infrequent events. This is described in more detail in the original publication (Church, 1988). Although more sophisticated algorithms for unsupervised learning - which can be trained on plain text instead on manually tagged corpora - are well established (see e.g. Merialdo, 1994), we decided not to use them. The main reason is that with large tag sets, the sparse-data-problem can become so severe that unsupervised training easily ends up in local minima, which can lead to poor results without any indication to the user.

Since the analysis system treats each word separately, ambiguities can not be resolved at this stage. For ambiguous word forms, all possible lemmata and their morphological descriptions are given (see Table 1 for the example Winde).
