Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999465894736842">
Discourse markers (&apos;cue words&apos;) are lexical
items that signal the kind of coherence relation
holding between adjacent text spans; for exam-
ple, because, since, and for this reason are dif-
ferent markers for causal relations. Discourse
markers are a syntactically quite heterogeneous
group of words, many of which are traditionally
treated as function words belonging to the realm
of grammar rather than to the lexicon. But for
a single discourse relation there is often a set
of similar markers, allowing for a range of para-
phrases for expressing the relation. To capture
the similarities and differences between these,
and to represent them adequately, we are devel-
oping DiMLex, a lexicon of discourse markers.
After describing our methodology and the kind
of information to be represented in DiMLex, we
briefly discuss its potential applications in both
text generation and understanding.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994205706896552">
Assuming that text can be formally described
(and represented) by means of discourse rela-
tions holding between adjacent portions of text
(e.g., [Mann, Thompson 1988]), we use the term
discourse marker for those lexical items that (in
addition to non-lexical means such as punctua-
tion, aspectual and focus shifts, etc.) can sig-
nal the presence of a relation at the linguistic
surface. Typically, a discourse relation is asso-
ciated with a wide range of such markers; con-
sider, for instance, the following variety of CON-
CESSIONS, which all express the same underly-
ing propositional content. The words treated
here as discourse markers are underlined.
We were in SoHo; {nevertheless I nonetheless
I however I still I yet), we found a cheap bar.
We were in SoHo, but we found a cheap bar
anyway.
Despite the fact that we were in SoHo, we
found a cheap bar.
Notwithstanding the fact that we were in
SoHo, we found a cheap bar.
Although we were in SoHo, we found a cheap
bar.
If one accepts these sentences as paraphrases,
then the various discourse markers all need to be
associated with the information that they sig-
nal a concessive relationship between the two
propositions involved. Next, the fine-grained
differences between similar markers need to be
represented; one such difference is the degree of
specificity: for example, but can mark a general
CONTRAST or a more specific CONCESSION. We
believe that a dedicated discourse marker lexi-
con holding this kind of information can serve
as a valuable resource for natural language pro-
cessing. Our efforts in constructing that lexicon
are described in Section 2.
From the perspective of text generation, not
all paraphrases listed above are equally felici-
tous in specific contexts. In order to choose
the most appropriate variant, a generator needs
knowledge about the fine-grained differences be-
tween similar markers for the same relation.
Furthermore, it needs to account for the interac-
tions between marker choice and other genera-
tion decisions and hence needs knowledge about
the syntagmatic constraints associated with dif-
ferent markers. We will discuss this perspective
in Section 3.
From the perspective of text understanding,
a sophisticated system should be able to derive
the discourse relations holding between adjacent
text spans, and also to notice the additional
semantic and pragmatic implications stemming
from the usage of a particular discourse marker.
We will briefly characterize such applications in
Section 4.

Lexicon
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99953">
2.1 The idea
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878217391304">
The traditional distinction between content
words and function words (or open-class and
closed-class items) relies on the stipulation that
the former have their &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; meaning indepen-
dent of the context in which they are used,
whereas the latter assume meaning only in con-
text. Then, content words are assigned to the
realm of the lexicon, whereas function words are
treated as a part of grammar.
For dealing with discourse markers, we do not
regard this distinction as particularly helpful,
though. As we have illustrated above and will
elaborate below, these words can carry a wide
variety of semantic and pragmatic overtones,
which render the choice of a marker meaning-
driven, as opposed to a mere consequence of
structural decisions. Furthermore, a number of
lexical relations that are customary used to as-
sign structure to the universe of &amp;quot;open class&amp;quot;
lexical items, most prominently synonymy, ple-
sionymy (&amp;quot;near-synonymy&amp;quot;), antonymy, hy-
ponymy and polysemy, can be applied to dis-
course markers as well:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997291458333334">
• Synonymy: It can be argued that true
synonyms do not exist at all. However,
the German words obzwar and obschon
(both more formal variants of obwohl = al-
though) certainly come very close to being
synonymous.
• Plesionymy: although and though, accord-
ing to Martin [1992], differ in formality; al-
though and even though differ in terms of
emphasis.
• Antonomy: if/unless, according to Barker
[1994], have opposite polarity, as in He will
not attend unless he finishes his paper vs.
He will attend if he finishes his paper.
• Hyponomy: Some markers are more spe-
cific than others; recall the example of but
given above. Knott and Mellish [1996] deal
with the issue of &amp;quot;taxonomizing&amp;quot; discourse
markers.
• Polysemy: Other than being more or less
specific, some markers can signal quite dif-
ferent relations; e.g., while can be used for
TEMPORAL CO-OCCURRENCE, and also for
CONTRAST.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980833333333">
Accordingly, we propose that the proper place
for describing discourse markers is a dedicated
lexicon that provides a classification of their
syntactic, semantic and pragmatic features and
characterizes the relationships between similar
markers. To this end, our group is developing
a DIscourse Marker LEXicon (DiMLex), which
aims at assembling the various information as-
sociated with markers and describing it on a
uniform level of representation. Our initial fo-
cus is on German, but English will also be a
target language.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997616">
2.2 Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991105263158">
Methodological considerations pertain to the
two tasks of determining the set of words we
regard as discourse markers and thus are to be
included in the lexicon, and determining the lex-
ical entries for these words.
Finding the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; set of discourse markers
is not an easy task, since the common lexico-
graphic practice of taking part of speech as the
primary criterion for inclusion or exclusion does
not apply. Knott and Mellish [1996] provide an
apt summary of the situation. Their &apos;test for
relational phrases&apos; is a good start, but geared
towards the English language (we are investigat-
ing German as well), and furthermore it catches
only items relating clauses; in Despite the heavy
rain, we went for a walk it would not detect a
cue phrase.
To arrive at a more comprehensive set, we
began by consulting standard grammars such
as Quirk et al. [1972] and Helbig and Buscha
[1991], which provide descriptions of function
words grouped according to semantic class —
but these are far from &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot;. A very
good source for German is [Brausse et al. in
prep.], which investigates a huge set of connec-
tives from a grammatical viewpoint.
As for determining lexical descriptions, the
research literature offers a large number of help-
ful, even though quite heterogeneous, sources.
There are several detailed studies of individ-
ual groups of markers, such as [Vander Linden,
Martin 1995] for PURPOSE markers. Besides,
the Linguistics literature offers fine-grained
analyses of individual markers, which are far too
numerous to list. We are drawing upon all these
sources, trying to place them in a single unified
framework. The overall goal can be character-
ized as the aim to synthesize two strands of re-

search that so far are rather disconnected:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9878698">
• &amp;quot;Top-down&amp;quot;: Text linguistics considers
markers as a means to signal coherence,
and provides us with insights on the se-
mantic and pragmatic properties of marker
classes.
• &amp;quot;Bottom-up&amp;quot;: Grammars as well as the
linguistic research literature provide syn-
tactic, semantic and stylistic properties of
individual markers, comparative studies of
related markers, etc.

2.3 The lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986831168832">
Although our classification of lexical features is
still under development, we give here a tenta-
tive list of such features in order to illustrate the
range of phenomena under consideration. The
list is loosely ordered from syntactic to seman-
tic and pragmatic features; for now, we do not
explicitly assign such categories.
The part of speech of a marker (conjunctive,
subordinating conjunction, coordinating con-
junction, preposition) determines the possibil-
ities of positioning the marker within the con-
stituent: conjunctives (especially the German
&apos;Konjunktionaladverbien&apos;) can float to various
positions, whereas the positions of others are
fixed. The linear order of the conjuncts is fixed
for some markers and flexible for others; this is
independent of the aforementioned two features.
Some markers show a specific behavior towards
negation, e.g., the German sondern (which cor-
responds to certain uses of but) requires an ex-
plicit negation in the antecedent clause. Some
markers impose constraints on tense and aspect
of the clauses, either by requiring specific tern-
poral/aspectual attributes in one clause, or by
constraining the relationship between the two
conjuncts (e.g., after).
Several grammars suggest classifications of
markers according to the semantic relation they
express: adversative, alternative, substitution,
causal, conditional, etc. Within these groups,
some markers exhibit opposite polarity, i.e.,
have an incorporated negation or not (e.g., if
versus unless). Commentability is a feature that
often distinguishes a single marker within a se-
mantic class in that it can be negated or fo-
cused on by scalar particles (e.g., in German,
the causal weil is commentable, whereas denn
is not).
Moving towards pragmatics, the intention be-
hind using a marker can vary. A well-known ex-
ample is the contrast between German aber and
sondern (in English, they both correspond to
but), where the former merely states a contrast,
whereas the latter corrects an assumption on
the hearer&apos;s side (e.g., [Helbig, Buscha 1991]).
Another dimension concerns the presuppositions
associated with markers; a well-known case is
the contrast between because and since, where
only the latter marks the subsequent proposi-
tion as given. The German CAUSE markers weil
and denn differ in terms of the illocutions they
connect: the former applies to propositions, the
latter to epistemic judgements [Brausse et al., in
prep.]. Certain very similar markers differ only
stylistically. One German example was given
above, and another one is the English notwith-
standing, which is more formal than despite but
moreover is more flexible in positioning, as it
can be postponed.
The final but crucial feature to be mentioned
here is the discourse relation expressed by a
marker. RST [Mann, Thompson 1988] offers
an inspiring theory of such relations, but we do
not fully subscribe to this account. Rather, we
think that the relationship between semantic re-
lations (see above) and pragmatic ones needs to
be clarified (e.g., [Asher 1993]), which can be
done by teasing apart the various dimensions
incoporated in RST&apos;s definitions, for example
in the spirit of Sanders et al. [1992].
Once the range of dimensions has been de-
scribed, we will deal with questions of repre-
sentation; we envisage using some inheritance-
based formalism that allows for a compact
representation of individual descriptions, hy-
ponymic relations between them, and polyse-
mous entries.

3 Using DiMLex in text generation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988351">
Present text generation systems are typically
not very good at choosing discourse mark-
ers. Even though a few systems have incor-
porated some more sophisticated mappings for
specific relations (e.g., in DRAFTER [Paris et
al. 1995]), there is still a general tendency to
treat discourse marker selection as a task to
be performed as a &amp;quot;side effect&amp;quot; by the gram-
mar, much like for other function words such as
prepositions.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.97468">
1240
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.939827046153846">
To improve this situation, we propose to view
discourse marker selection as one subtask of the
general lexical choice process, so that — to con-
tinue the example given above — one or an-
other form of CONCESSION can be produced in
the light of the specific utterance parameters
and the context. Obviously, marker selection
also includes the decision whether to use any
marker at all or leave the relation implicit (e.g.,
[Di Eugenio et al. 1997]). When these decisions
can be systematically controlled, the text can
be tailored much better to the specific goals of
the generation process.
The generation task imposes a particular view
of the information coded in DiMLex: the en-
try point to the lexicon is the discourse relation
to be realized, and the lookup yields the range
of alternatives. But many markers have more
semantic and pragmatic constraints associated
with them, which have to be verified in the
generator&apos;s input representation for the marker
to be a candidate. Then, discourse markers
place (predominantly syntactic) constraints on
their immediate context, which affects the in-
teractions between marker choice and other re-
alization decisions. And finally, markers that
are still equivalent after evaluating these con-
straints are subject to a choice process that
can utilize preferential (e.g. stylistic) criteria.
Therefore, under the generation view, the infor-
mation in DiMLex is grouped into the following
three classes:
— Applicability conditions: The necessary
conditions for using a discourse marker, i.e., the
features or structural configurations that need
to be present in the input specification.
— Syntagmatic constraints: The constraints
regarding the combination of a marker and the
neighbouring constituents; most of them are
syntactic and appear at the beginning of the list
given above (part of speech, linear order, etc.).
— Paradigmatic features: Features that label
the differences between similar markers sharing
the same applicability conditions, such as stylis-
tic features and degrees of emphasis.
Very briefly, we see discourse marker choice
as one aspect of the sentence planning task
(e.g., [Wanner, Hovy 1996]). In order to ac-
count for the intricate interactions between
marker choice and other generation decisions,
the idea is to employ DiMLex as a declara-
tive resource supporting the sentence planning
process, which comprises determining sentence
boundaries and sentence structure, linear order-
ing of constituents (e.g., thematizations), and
lexical choice. All these decisions are heavily
interdependent, and in order to produce truly
adequate text, the various realization options
need to be weighted against each other (in con-
trast to a simple, fixed sequence of making the
types of decisions), which presupposes a flexible
computational mechanism based on resources
as declarative as possible. This generation ap-
proach is described in more detail in a separate
paper [Grote, Stede 1998].

4 Using DiMLex in text
understanding
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943727272727">
In text understanding, discourse markers serve
as cues for inferring the rhetorical or seman-
tic structure of the text. In the approach pro-
posed by Marcu [1997], for example, the pres-
ence of discourse markers is used to hypothe-
size individual textual units and relations hold-
ing between them. Then, the overall discourse
structure tree is built using constraint satisfac-
tion techniques. For tasks of this kind, DiMLex
can supply the set of cue words to be looked
for and support the initial disambiguation of
cues in the text. Depending on the depth of
the syntactic and semantic analysis carried out
by the text understanding system, different fea-
tures provided by DiMLex can be taken into
account. Certain structural configurations can
be tested without any deep understanding; for
instance, the German marker wahrend is gen-
erally ambiguous between a CONTRAST and a
TEMPORALCOOCCURRENCE reading, but when
followed by a noun phrase, only the latter read-
ing is available (warend corresponds not only
to the English while but also to during).
Similarly, we envisage applications of DiM-
Lex for dialogue processing. For example,
within the VERBMOBIL project, Stede and
Schmitz [1997] have analysed the various prag-
matic functions that German discourse parti-
cles fulfill in dialogue; many of these particles
are discourse markers, and DiMLex can provide
valuable information for their disambiguation,
which in turn facilitates the recognition of un-
derlying speech acts.

5 Summary and Outlook
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963566666667">
Discourse markers, words that signal the pres-
ence of a coherence relation between adjacent
text spans, play important roles in human text
understanding and production. Due to their be-
ing classified as &amp;quot;non-content words&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;func-
tion words&amp;quot;, however, they have not received
sufficient attention in natural language process-
ing yet. In response to this situation, we are as-
sembling pieces of information on German and
English discourse markers from grammars, dic-
tionaries, and the linguistics research literature.
This information is classified and organized into
a discourse marker lexicon, DiMLex.
The first phase of our project runs until mid-
1999. At present, we are on the theoretical
side focusing our attention on German CON-
TRAST and CONCESSION markers; on the imple-
mentational side, we have assembled a genera-
tion testbed that allows for exploring the role of
DiMLex in producing paragraph-size text. By
the end of the first phase, we plan to have com-
pleted a system that produces German and En-
glish text, with a prototypical DiMLex specified
for contrastive markers. For a potential follow-
up phase of the project, we envisage enlarging
DiMLex to other groups of markers; working
out systematic lexical representations within a
suitable formalism; and giving more attention
to the requirements for text understanding in
addition to those of generation.

Once the range of dimensions has been described, we will deal with questions of representation; we envisage using some inheritancebased formalism that allows for a compact representation of individual descriptions, hyponymic relations between them, and polysemous entries. 3 Using DiMLex in text generation Present text generation systems are typically not very good at choosing discourse markers. Even though a few systems have incorporated some more sophisticated mappings for specific relations (e.g., in DRAFTER [Paris et al. 1995]), there is still a general tendency to treat discourse marker selection as a task to be performed as a &amp;quot;side effect&amp;quot; by the grammar, much like for other function words such as prepositions. 1240 To improve this situation, we propose to view discourse marker selection as one subtask of the general lexical choice process, so that — to continue the example given above — one or another form of CONCESSION can be produced in the light of the specific utterance parameters and the context. Obviously, marker selection also includes the decision whether to use any marker at all or leave the relation i</context>
