Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925076923077">
We describe a parallel annotation ap-
proach for PubMed abstracts. It includes
both entity/relation annotation and a tree-
bank containing syntactic structure, with a
goal of mapping entities to constituents in
the treebank. Crucial to this approach is a
modification of the Penn Treebank guide-
lines and the characterization of entities as
relation components, which allows the in-
tegration of the entity annotation with the
syntactic structure while retaining the ca-
pacity to annotate and extract more com-
plex events.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99979014">
A great deal of annotation effort for many different
corpora has been devoted to annotation for entities
and syntactic structure (treebanks). However, pre-
vious efforts at treebanking have largely been inde-
pendent of the constituency of entities, and previous
efforts at entity annotation have likewise been inde-
pendent of corresponding layers of syntactic struc-
ture. We describe here a corpus being developed
for biomedical information extraction with levels of
both entity annotation and treebank annotation, with
a goal that entities can be mapped to constituents in
the treebank.
We are collaborating with researchers in the Di-
vision of Oncology at The Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia, for the purpose of automatically min-
ing the corpus of cancer literature for those as-
sociations that link specified variations in individ-
ual genes with known malignancies. In particular,
we are interested in extracting three entities (Gene,
Variation event, and Malignancy) in the following
relationship: Gene X with genomic Variation event
Y is correlated with Malignancy Z. For example,
WT1 is deleted in Wilms Tumor #5. In addition, Vari-
ation events are themselves relations, consisting of
entities representing different aspects of a Variation
event.
Mapping entities to treebank constituents is a de-
sirable goal since the entities can then be viewed
as semantic types associated with syntactic con-
stituents, and we expect that automated analyses of
these related levels will interact in a mutually rein-
forcing and beneficial way for development of sta-
tistical taggers.
In this paper we describe aspects of the entity
and treebank annotation that allow this mapping
to be largely successful. Potentially large enti-
ties that would otherwise cut across syntactic con-
stituents are decomposed into components of a re-
lation. While this is worthwhile by itself on con-
ceptual grounds for entity definition, and was in fact
not done for reasons of mapping to syntactic con-
stituents, it makes such a mapping easier. The tree-
bank annotation has been modified from the Penn
Treebank guidelines in various ways, such as greater
structure for prenominal modifiers. Again, while
this would have been done regardless of the map-
ping of entities, it does make such a mapping more
successful.

with entity information, as well as relation infor-

mation, is described in (Miller et al., 2000). Our
work is in much the same spirit, although we do
not integrate relation annotation into the syntactic
trees. PubMed abstracts are quite different from the
newswire sources used in that earlier work, with sev-
eral consequences discussed throughout, such as the
use of discontinuous entities.
Section 2 discusses some of the main issues
around the development of the guidelines for en-
tity annotation, and Section 3 discusses some of the
changes that have been made for the treebank guide-
lines. Section 4 describes the annotation workflow
and the resulting merged representation. Section
5 evaluates the mapping between entities and con-
stituents, and Section 6 is the conclusion.

2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925153846154">
Here we give a summary of the main features of
our annotation guidelines. We have been influenced
in this by the annotation guidelines for the Auto-
matic Content Extraction (ACE) project (Consor-
tium, 2004).1 However, our source materials are
medical abstracts from PubMed2, and important dif-
ferences between the domains have required sig-
nificant changes and additions to many definitions,
guidelines, and procedures.
Most obviously, the vocabulary is very different.
Many of the tokens in our source texts are chemical
terms with a complex productive morphology, and a
certain number are unique in PubMed. Many oth-
ers are strings of notation, like S37F, often contain-
ing relevant entity references that must be isolated
(S, 37, and F). And even apart from these, we are
looking at a very different dialect of English from
that used by the Wall Street Journal and the Asso-
ciated Press. Annotation of English newswire re-
quires native English competency; entity annotation
of biomedical English requires a background in bi-
ology as well.
The entity instances in the text are also qualita-
tively different. Instead of individual pieces of the
physical or social universe – Emanuel Sosa, the Eif-
fel Tower, the man in the yellow hat – we have ab-

2.1 Entities Annotated
2.1.1 Gene Entity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998606">
For the sake of this project the definition for
“Gene Entity” has two significant characteristics.
First, as just mentioned, “Gene” refers to a concep-
tual entity as opposed to the specific manifestation
of a gene (e.g., not the “K-ras” in some specific cell
in some individual, but an abstraction that cannot be
pointed to).
Second, “Gene” refers to a composite entity as op-
posed to the strict biological definition. There are
often ambiguities in the usage of the entity names. I
is sometimes unclear as to whether the gene or pro-
tein is being referenced, and the same name can refer
to the gene or the protein at different locations in the
same document. In a similar way as the ACE project
allows “geopolitical” entities to have different roles,
such as “location” or “organization”, we consider a
“Gene” to be a composite entity that can have differ-
ent roles throughout a document. Therefore, Gene
entity mentions can have types Gene-generic, Gene-
protein, and Gene-RNA.

2.1.2 Variation Events as Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9973365">
As mentioned in the introduction, Variation
events are relations between entities representing
different aspects of a Variation; specifically, a Vari-
ation is a relationship between two or more of
the following entities: Type (e.g., point mutation,
translocation, or inversion), Location (e.g., codon
14, 1p36.1, or base pair 278), Original-State and
Altered-State (e.g., Thymine).
The entities as such are independent and uncon-
nected. We add a level of relation to annotate the
associations between them: For example, the text
fragment a single nucleotide substitution at codon
249, predicting a serine to cysteine amino acid sub-
stitution (S249C) contains the entities:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.89523625">
Variation-type substitution
Variation-location codon 249
3This domain shows no such clear distinction between Name
and Nominal mentions as in the texts covered by ACE.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.999204">
22
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9535955">
Variation-state-original serine
Variation-state-altered cysteine
These entities are annotated individually but are also
collected into a single Variation relation.
It is also possible for a Variation relation to arise
from a more compact collection of entities. For ex-
ample, the text S249C consists of three entities col-
lected into a Variation relation:
Variation-location 249
Variation-state-original S
Variation-state-altered C
These four components represent the key ele-
ments necessary to describe any genomic variation
event. Variations are often underspecified in the lit-
erature. For example, the first relation above has
all four components while the second is missing
the Variation-type. Characterizing individual Varia-
tions as relations among such components provides
us with a great deal of flexibility.
The “Gene” entities are analogous to the ACE
geopolitical entity, in that the second part of the en-
tity names (“-RNA”, “-generic”,”-protein”) disam-
biguates the metonymy of the “Gene”. The subtypes
of the Variation entities, in contrast, indicate differ-
ent kinds of entities in their own right, which can
also function as components of a Variation relation.

The Malignancy annotation guidelines were un-

We have introduced a mechanism we call “chain-

be more common in abstracts than in full text be-
cause of the pressure to reduce word count. For ex-
ample, in K- and N-ras there are two entities, K-ras
and N-ras, of which only the second is a solid block
of text. Our entity annotators are allowed to change
the tokenization if necessary to isolate the compo-

3 Treebank Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999876642857143">
The Penn Treebank II guidelines (Bies et al., 1995)
were followed as closely as possible, but the nature
of the biomedical corpus has made some changes
necessary or desirable. We have also taken this
opportunity to address several long-standing issues
with the original set of guidelines, with regard to NP
structure in particular. This has resulted in the intro-
duction of one new node label for sub-NP nominal
substrings (NML). One additional empty category
(*P*) has been introduced in order to improve the
match-up of chained entity categories with treebank
nodes. It is used as a placeholder to represent dis-
tributed modification in nominals and does not rep-
resent the trace of movement.

3.1 Tokenization/Part-of-Speech
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997">
We have also adopted several changes in word-level
tokenization, leading to a number of part-of-speech
and structural differences as well. Many hyphenated
words are now treated as separate tokens (New York
- based would be four tokens, for example). These
hyphens now have the part-of-speech tag HYPH. If
the separated prefix is a morphological unit that does
not exist as a free-standing word, it has the part-of-
speech tag AFX. With chemical names and scien-
tific notation in the biomedical corpus in particular,
spaces and punctuation may occur within a single
“token”, which will have a single POS tag.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991876">
3.2 Right-Branching Default
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982647055555555">
We assume a default binary right-branching struc-
ture under any NP and NML node. Each daughter
of the phrase (whether a single token or itself a con-
stituent node) is assumed to have scope over every-
thing to its right. This means that every daughter
also forms a constituent with everything to its right.
This assumption makes the annotation process for
multi-token nominals less complex and the resulting
trees more legible, but still allows us to readily de-
rive constituent nodes not explicitly represented. For
example, in
(NP (JJ primary) (NN liver)
(NN cancer))
we assume that “liver cancer” is a constituent, and
that “primary” has scope over it.
So, although we do not show the intermediate
nodes explicitly in our annotation, our assumed
structure for this NP could be derived as
</bodyText>

(NP (JJ primary)
(newnode (NN liver)
(newnode (NN cancer))))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984775">
As discussed in Section 5, entities sometimes map
to such implicit constituents, and a node needs to
be added to make the constituent explicit so the the
entity can be mapped to it.

3.4 New Empty Category for Distributed
Readings within NP: *P*
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9983062">
As discussed in Section 2.2, discontinuous enti-
ties are annotated using the “chaining” mechanism.
Analogously, we have introduced a placeholder,
*P*, for distributed material in the treebank. It is
used exclusively in coordinated nominal structures,
placed in coordinated elements that are missing ei-
ther a distributed head or a distributed premodifier.
In K- and N-ras, the coordinated premodifier K- is
missing the distributed head ras, so the placeholder
*P* is inserted after K- and coindexed with ras:

4 Annotation Process
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999449538461539">
The annotation process comprises the following
steps: Paragraph and sentence annotation (includ-
ing the delimitation of irrelevant text such as au-
thor names); tokenization; entity annotation; part-
of-speech (POS) annotation; treebanking; merged
representation.
Entity annotation precedes POS annotation, since
the entity annotators often have to correct the tok-
enization, which affects the POS labels. For exam-
ple, nephro- and hepatocarcinoma refers to two en-
tities, nephrocarcinoma and hepatocarcinoma, and
so the entity annotator would split hepatocarcinoma
into two tokens, for chaining nephro and carcinoma

<footnote confidence="0.78139575">
4In spite of the apparent similarity between *P* and right
node raising structures (*RNR*), they are not interchangeable
as the shared element often occurs to the left rather than the
right (e.g., codon 12 or 13 in Section 5.3).
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.997698">

<bodyText confidence="0.999913966666666">
(see Section 2.2). Since the entity annotators are not
qualified for POS annotation, doing POS annotation
after entity annotation allows the POS annotators to
annotate any such tokenization changes.
Treebank annotation uses the same tokenization
as for the corresponding entity file. Continuing the
above example, the treebank file would have sepa-
rate tokens for hepato and carcinoma. Note that this
would be the case even if we did not have the goal
of mapping entities to constituents. It arises from the
more minimal requirement of maintaining identical
tokenization in the treebank and entity files, and so
leads to changes in treebank annotation such as dis-
cussed in Section 3.4.
All of the annotation steps except entity annota-
tion use automated taggers (or a parser in the case of
treebanking),5 producing annotation that then gets
hand-corrected.
The use of the parser for producing a parse for
correction by the treebankers include a somewhat
unusual feature that arises from our parallel entity
and treebank annotation. The parser that we are us-
ing, (Bikel, 2004),6 allows prebracketing of parts
of the parser input, so that the parser will respect
the prebracketing. We use this ability to prebracket
entities, which can also help to disambiguate the
constituencies for prenominal modifiers, which can
often be unclear for annotators without a medical
background. For example, the input to the parser
might contain something like:

The 318 files that have been both treebanked and en-

format. The treebank and entity annotations are both
stand-off, referring to character spans in the same
source file, and we take advantage of this so that the
merged representation relates the entities and con-
stituents by these spans. Figure 1 shows a fragment
of one such .mrg file.
This .mrg file excerpt shows the text of sen-
tence 4 in the file, which spans the character offsets

the .mrg files from the Penn Treebank, except that
each terminal has the format
(POSTag:[from..to] terminal)
where [from..to] is that terminal’s span in the
source file.
The first entity listed, K-ras, is a Gene-RNA entity

One of our goals for the release of the corpus is to
allow users to choose how they wish to handle the
integration of the entity and treebank information.
By providing the corresponding spans for both as-
pects of the annotation, we provide the raw material
for any integrated approach.
We therefore do not attempt to force the entities
and constituents to line up perfectly. However, given
the parallel annotation just illustrated, we can an-
alyze how close we come to the ideal of the en-
tities behaving as semantic types on syntactic con-

each entity/treebank mapping in one of three ways:
Exact match There is a node in the tree that yields
exactly the entity. For example, the entity exon 2 in

yields exactly that entity, but it is possible to add a
node to the tree that would yield the entity. A com-
mon reason for this is that the default right branch-
ing treebank annotation (Section 3.2) does not make
explicit the required node.

the constituent mapping even aside from the determiner issue.
It is possible for the PP, such as of codon 12, to be followed by
another PP, such as in K-ras. Since all PPs are attached at the
same level, of codon 12 and in K-ras are sisters, and so, even
if the determiner was included in the entity name, there is no
constituent consisting of just the second position of codon 12.
However, in that case it is then possible to add a node yield-

5.2 Overall Mapping Results

<bodyText confidence="0.956005333333334">
Table 2 is a breakdown of how well the (non-chain)
entities can be mapped to constituents. Here we are
concerned only with entities that consist of multiple
tokens, since single-token entities can of course map
directly to the relevant token.
The number of crossing cases is relatively small.
One reason for this is the use of relations for break-
ing potentially large entities into component parts,
since the component entities either already map to
an entity or can easily be made to do so by mak-
ing implicit constituents explicit to disambiguate the
tree structure. The crossing cases tend to be ones in
which the entities are in a sense a bit too “big”, such
as including a prepositional phrase.9
8Another alternative would be to modify the treatment of
noun phrases and determiners in the treebank annotation to be
more akin to DPs. However, this has proved to be an impractical
addition to the annotation process.
9As discussed in Section 4, we are prebracketing entities in
the parses prepared for the treebankers to correct. There are two
possibilities for how the entities can therefore ever cross tree-
bank constituents: (1) the treebank annotation was done before
we started doing such prebracketing, so the treebank annotator
was not aware of the entities, or (2) the prebracketing was in-

Table 3 shows the matching status of multiple token
instances that are also chains (and so were not in-
cluded in Table 2). The presence of chains is mostly
localized to certain entity types, and the mapping is
mostly successful. Variation-location contains many
of the chains due to the occurrences of phrases such
as codon 12 or 13, which map exactly to the corre-
sponding use of the *P* placeholder, such as:

Cases that do not map exactly are ones in which
the syntactic context does not permit the use of

<bodyText confidence="0.99704636">
We have described here parallel syntactic and entity
annotation and how changes in the guidelines facil-
itate a mapping between entities and syntactic con-
stituents. Our main purpose in this paper has been to
investigate the success of this mapping. As Tables 2
and 3 show, once we make explicit the implicit right-
branching binary structure, only 6.2%10 of the enti-
ties cannot be mapped directly to a node in the tree.
It also appears likely that a significant percentage of
even the non-matching cases can match as well, with
a slight relaxation of the matching requirement (e.g.,
allowing entities to have an optional determiner).
deed done, but the treebank annotator could not abide by the
resulting tree and modified the parser output accordingly.
101410 total multiple token entities, both chained and non-
chained, with 87 cases that cannot be mapped (55 crossing, 32
chained non-exact match).
We view this in part as a successful experiment
illustrating how both linguistic content and entity
annotation can be enhanced by their interaction.
We expect this enhancement to be useful both for
biomedical information extraction in particular and
more generally for the development of statistical
systems that can take into account different levels
of annotation in a mutually beneficial way.

It includes both entity/relation annotation and a treebank containing syntactic structure, with a goal of mapping entities to constituents in the treebank. Crucial to this approach is a modification of the Penn Treebank guidelines and the characterization of entities as relation components, which allows the integration of the entity annotation with the syntactic structure while retaining the capacity to annotate and extract more complex events.</abstract>

We have also taken this opportunity to address several long-standing issues with the original set of guidelines, with regard to NP structure in particular. This has resulted in the introduction of one new node label for sub-NP nominal substrings (NML).

It arises from the more minimal requirement of maintaining identical tokenization in the treebank and entity files, and so leads to changes in treebank annotation such as discussed in Section 3.4. All of the annotation steps except entity annotation use automated taggers (or a parser in the case of treebanking),5 producing annotation that then gets hand-corrected. The use of the parser for producing a parse for correction by the treebankers include a somewhat unusual feature that arises from our parallel entity and treebank annotation. The parser that we are using, (Bikel, 2004),6 allows prebracketing of parts of the parser input, so that the parser will respect the prebracketing. We use this ability to prebracket entities, which can also help to disambiguate the constituencies for prenominal modifiers, which can often be unclear for annotators without a medical background. For example, the input to the parser might contain something like: ...(NN activation) (IN of) (PRP$ its) (* (NN tyrosine) (NN kinase) ) (NN activity)... indicating by the (* ) that tyrosine kinase should be a constituent.

We have been influenced in this by the annotation guidelines for the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) project (Consortium, 2004).1 However, our source materials are medical abstracts from PubMed2, and important differences between the domains have required significant changes and additions to many definitions, guidelines, and procedures. Most obviously, the vocabulary is very different. Many of the tokens in our source texts are chemical terms with a complex productive morphology, and a certain number are unique in PubMed. Many others are strings of notation, like S37F, often containing relevant entity references that must be isolated (S, 37, and F). And even apart from these, we are looking at a very different dialect</context>
