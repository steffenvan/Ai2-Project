<bodyText confidence="0.999942722222223">
The JMdict project has at its aim the
compilation of a multilingual lexical
database with Japanese as the pivot
language. Using an XML structure designed
to cater for a mix of languages and a rich set
of lexicographic information, it has reached
a size of approximately 100,000 entries,
with most entries having translations in
English, French and German. The
compilation involves information re-use,
with the French and German translations
being drawn from separately maintained
lexicons. Material from other languages is
also being included. The file is freely
available for research purposes and for
incorporation in dictionary application
software, and is available in several WWW
server systems.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927047619048">
The JMdict project has as its primary goal
the compilation of a Japanese-multilingual
dictionary, i.e. a dictionary in which the
headwords are from the Japanese lexicon,
and the translations are in several other
languages. It may be viewed as a synthesis
of a series of Japanese-Other Language
bilingual dictionaries, although, as discussed
below, there is merit in having this
information collocated.
The project grew out of, and has now
subsumed, an earlier Japanese-English
dictionary project (EDICT: Electronic
Dictionary) (Breen, 1995, 2004a). With
Japanese being an important language in
world trade, and with it being the second
most common language used on the WWW,
it is not surprising that there is considerable
interest in electronic lexical resources for
Japanese in combination with other
languages.

2 Project Goals and Development
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.907846226415094">
As mentioned above, the JMdict project
grew out of the bilingual EDICT dictionary
project. The EDICT project began in the
early 1990s with a relatively simple goal of
producing a Japanese-English dictionary file
that could be used in basic software
packages to provide traditional dictionary
services, as well as facilities to assist reading
Japanese text. The format was (and is) quite
simple, comprising lines of text consisting
of a Japanese word written using kanji
and/or kana, the reading (pronunciation) of
that word in kana, and one or more English
translations.
By the late 1990s, the file had outgrown its
humble origins, having reached over 50,000
entries, and having spun off a parallel
project for recording Japanese proper nouns
(see below). The material has partly been
drawn from word lists, vocabulary lists, etc.
in the public domain, and supplemented by
material prepared by large numbers of users
and other volunteers wishing to contribute.
While it had been used in a variety of
software systems, and as a source of lexical
material in a number of projects, it was clear
that its structure was quite inadequate for the
lexical demands being made by users. In
particular, it was not able to incorporate a
suitable variety of information, nor represent
the orthographical complexities of the
source language. Accordingly, in 1999 it
was decided to launch a new dictionary
project incorporating the information from
the EDICT file, but expanded to include
translations from other languages with the
Japanese entries remaining as the pivots.
The project goals were:
a. a file format, preferably using a
recognized standard, which would enable
ready access and parsing by a variety of
software applications;
b. the handling of orthographical and
pronunciation variation within the single
entry. This addressed a major problem with
the EDICT format, as many Japanese words
can be written with alternative kanji and
with varying portions in kana (okurigana),
and may have alternative pronunciations.
The EDICT format required each variant to
be treated as a separate entry, which added
to the complexity of maintaining and
extending the dictionary;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.676905173913044">
c. additional and more appropriately
associated tagging of grammatical and other
information. Certain information such as the
part of speech or the source language of loan
words had been added to the EDICT file in
parentheses within the translation fields, but
the scope was limited and the information
could not easily be parsed;
d. provision for differentiation
between different senses in the translations.
While basic indication of polysemy had
been provided in the EDICT file by
prepending (1), (2), etc. to groups of
translations, the result was difficult to parse.
Also it did not support the case where a
sense or nuance was tied to a particular
pronunciation, as occurs occasionally in
Japanese;
e. provision for the inclusion of
translational equivalents from several
languages. The EDICT dictionary file was
being used in a number of countries, and
several informal projects had begun to
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.849113888888889">
develop equivalent files for Japanese and
other target languages. A small Japanese-
German file (JDDICT) had been released in
the EDICT format. There was considerable
interest expressed in having translations in
various languages collocated to enable such
things as having a single reference file for
several languages, cross-referencing of
entries, cross-language retrieval, etc. as well
as acting as a focus for the possible
development of translations for as yet
unrepresented languages;
f. provision for inclusion of examples
of the usage of words. As the file expanded,
many users of the file requested some form
of usage examples to be associated with the
words in the file. The EDICT format was
not capable of supporting this;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.930269666666667">
g. provision for cross-references to
related entries;
h. continued generation of EDICT-
format files. As a large number of packages
and servers had been built around the
EDICT format, continued provision of
content in this format was considered
important, even if the information only
contained a sub-set of what was available.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992241025641">
An early decision was to use XML
(Extensible Markup Language) as a format
for the JMdict file, as this was expected to
provide the appropriate flexibility in format,
and was also expected to be supported by
applications, parsing libraries, etc.
An examination was made of other available
dictionary formats to ascertain if a suitable
formatting model was available. It was
known that commercial dictionary
publishers has well-structured databases of
lexical information, and some were moving
to XML, but none of the details were
available. A large number of bilingual
dictionary files and word lists were in the
public domain; however in general they only
used very simple structures, and none could
be found which covered all the content
requirements of the project. The dictionary
section of the TEI (Text Encoding
Initiative), which at the time of writing has a
well-developed document structure for
bilingual dictionaries, was at that stage quite
limited (Sperberg-McQueen et al, 1999).
Accordingly, an XML DTD (Document
Type Definition) was developed which was
tailored to the requirements of the project.
The EDICT file was parsed and reformatted
into the JMdict structure, and at the same
time, many of the orthographical variants
were identified and merged. The initial
release of the DTD and XML-format file
took place in May 1999. At that stage, it
contained the English translations from the
EDICT file and the German translations
from the JDDICT file. As described below,
it has been expanded considerably since
then, both in terms of number of entries and
also in multi-lingual coverage.

3 Project Status
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935941176471">
The JMdict file was first released in 1999,
and updated versions are released 3-4 times
each year along with versions of the EDICT
file, which is generated at the same time
from the same data files. The file now has
over 99,300 entries, i.e. the size of a
medium-large printed dictionary, and the
growth in numbers of entries is now
relatively slow, with most updates dealing
with corrections and expansion of existing
entries.
The file is available under a liberal licence
that allows its use for almost any purpose
without fee. The only requirement is that its
use be fully acknowledged and that any files
developed from it continue under the same
licence conditions.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.993584" genericHeader="method">
4 Structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904011627907">
The JMdict XML structure contains one
element type: &lt;entry&gt;, which in turn
contains sequence number, kanji word, kana
word, information and translation elements.
The sequence number is used for
maintenance and identification.
The kanji word and kana word elements
contain the two forms of the Japanese
headwords; the former is used for
representations containing at least one kanji
character, while the latter is for
representations in kana alone. The kana
word is effectively the pronunciation, but is
also an important key for indexing the
dictionary file, as Japanese dictionaries are
usually ordered by kana words. The
minimum content of these fields is a single
word in the kana word element. In addition,
each entry may contain information about
the words (unusual orthographical variant,
archaic kanji, etc.) and frequency of use
information. The latter needs to be
associated with the actual words rather than
the entry as a whole because some
combinations of kanji and kana words are
used more frequently than others. (For
example, 合気道 and 合氣道 are
orthographical variants of the one word
(aikidô), but the former is more common.)
The kana used in the elements follows
modern Japanese orthography, i.e. hiragana
is used for native Japanese words, and
katakana for loan words, onomatopoeic
words, etc.
In most cases an entry has just one kanji and
one kana word (approx. 75%), or one kana
word alone (15%). In about 10% of entries
there are multiple words in one of the
elements. In some cases a kana reading can
only be associated with a subset of the kanji
words in the entry. For example, soyokaze
(そよかぜ: breeze) can be written either
微風 or そよ風 (the latter is more common
as そよ is a non-standard reading of the 微
kanji). However 微風 can also be
pronounced bifuu (びふう) with the same
meaning, but clearly this pronunciation
cannot be associated with the そよ風 form,
as the kana portion is read &amp;quot;soyo&amp;quot;. XML
does not provide an elegant method for
indicating a restricted mapping between
portions of two elements, so when such a
restriction is required, additional tags are
used with each kana word supplying the
kanji word with which it may be validly
associated.
The information element contains general
information about the Japanese word or the
entry as a whole. The contents allow for
ISO-639 source language codes (for loan
words), dialect codes, etymology,
bibliographic information and update
details.
The translation area consists of one or more
sense elements that contain at a minimum a
single gloss. Associated with each sense is a
set of elements containing part of speech,
cross-reference, synonym/antonym, usage,
etc. information. Also associated with the
sense may be restriction codes tying the
sense to a subset of the Japanese words. For
example, *&apos;X can be pronounced suiki
(tL�) and mizuge ( �&apos;6�); both
meaning &amp;quot;moisture&amp;quot;, but the former alone
can also mean &amp;quot;dropsy&amp;quot;.
The gloss element has an attribute stating
the target language of the translation. In its
absence it is assumed the gloss is in English.
There is also an attribute stating the gender,
if for example, the part-of-speech is a noun
and the gloss is in a language with gendered
nouns. Figure 1 shows a slightly simplified
example of an entry. The &lt;ke_pri&gt; and
&lt;re_pri&gt; elements indicate the word is a
member of a particular set of common
words.

<bodyText confidence="0.989546446808511">
The potential to have multiple kanji and
kana words within an entry brings attention
to the issues of homonymy, homography
and polysemy, and the policies for handling
these, in particular the criteria for combining
kanji and kana words into a single entry. As
Japanese has a comparatively limited set of
phonemes there are a large number of
homophonous words. For example, over
twenty different words have the kana
representation :5L15 (kôjô). If we
regard homography as only applying to
words written wholly or partly with kanji,
there are relatively few cases of it, however
they do exist, e.g. M� when read
-tl-Iv9�O5 (senryû) means a comic poem,
but when read 7)&gt;tD&apos;�04 9 (kawayanagi)
means a variety of willow tree.
The combining rule that has been applied in
the compilation of the JMdict file is as
follows:
a. treat each basic entry as a triplet
consisting of: kanji representation, matching
kana representation, senses;
b. if for any basic entries two or more
members of the triplet are the same,
combine them into the one entry;
i. if the entries differ in kanji
or kana representation, include these
as alternative forms;
ii. if the entries differ in sense,
treat as a case of polysemy;
c. in other cases leave the entries
separate.
This rule has been applied successfully in a
majority of cases. The main problems arise
where the meanings are similar or related, as
in the case of the entries: (Rt, N:4�t, to
separate; to set free; to turn loose) and
(Ot, N:4�t, to part; to divide; to
separate), where the kana words are the
same and the meanings overlap. Japanese
dictionaries are divided on Rt and Ot ;
some keeping them as separate entries, and
others having them as the one entry with two
main senses. (The two words derive from a
common source.)
</bodyText>

5 Parts of Speech and Related Issues
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.999799464285715">
The omission of such derived forms means
that care needs to be taken when
constructing the translations so that the user
is readily able to identify the appropriate
translation of one of the derived forms.
As languages differ in their parts of speech
(POS), the recording of those details in
bilingual dictionaries can be a problem (Al-
Kasimi, 1977). Traditionally bilingual
dictionaries involving Japanese avoid
recording any POS information, leaving it to
the user to deduce that information from the
translation and examples (if any). In the
early stages of the EDICT project, POS
information was deliberately kept to a
minimum, e.g. indicating where a verb was
transitive or intransitive when this was not
apparent from the translation, mainly to
conserve storage space. As there are a
number of advantages in having POS
information marked in an electronic
dictionary file, a POS element was included
in the JMdict structure, and publicly
available POS classifications were used to
populate much of the file. About 30% of
entries remain to be classified; mostly nouns
or short noun phrases.
In the interests of saving space an early
decision had been made to avoid listing
derived forms of words. For example, the
Japanese adjective AU` (takai) meaning
&amp;quot;high, tall, expensive&amp;quot; has derived forms of
AL�S (takasa) &amp;quot;height&amp;quot; and Aく (takaku)
&amp;quot;highly&amp;quot;. As this process is very regular,
many Japanese dictionaries do not carry
entries for the derived forms, and some
bilingual dictionaries follow suit. Another
such example is the common verb form,
sometimes called a &amp;quot;verbal noun&amp;quot;, which is
created by adding the verb t;5 (suru) &amp;quot;to
do&amp;quot; to appropriate nouns. The verb &amp;quot;to
study&amp;quot; is O-Nt;5 (benkyôsuru) where
O-N is a noun meaning &amp;quot;study&amp;quot; in this
context. Again, Japanese dictionaries often
do not include these forms as headwords,
preferring to indicate in the body of an entry
that the formation is possible.
In a multilingual context, the omission of
derived forms can have other problems. The
recording of t;5 verbs only in their noun
base form has been reported to lead to some
discomfort among German users, as German
language orthographical convention
capitalizes the first letters of nouns but not
verbs (the WaDokuJT file has t;5 verbs as
separate entries for this reason).

6 Inclusion and Maintenance of Multiple
Languages
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.910199837209303">
As mentioned above, part of the interest in
having entries with translations in a range of
languages came from the compilation of a
number of dictionary files based on or
similar to the EDICT file. There are a
number of issues associated with the
inclusion of material from other dictionary
files, in particular those relating to the
compilation policies: coverage, handling of
inflected forms, etc. (Breen, 2002) There is
also the major issue of the editing and
maintenance of the material, which has the
potential to become more complex as each
language is incorporated.
The approach taken with JMdict has been to:
a. maintain a core Japanese-English
file with a well-documented structure and
set of inclusion and editing policies;
b. encourage the development and
maintenance of equivalent files in other
languages paired with Japanese, which can
draw on the JMdict/EDICT material as
required;
c. periodically build the complete
multi-lingual JMdict from the different
components.
This approach has proved successful in that
it has separated the compilation of the file
from the ongoing editing of the components,
and has left the latter in the hands of those
with the skills and motivation to perform the
task.
At the time of writing, the JMdict file has
over 99,300 entries (Japanese and English),
of which 83,500 have German translations,
58,000 have French translations, 4,800 have
Russian translations and 530 have Dutch
translations. A set of approximately 4,500
Spanish translations is being prepared, with
the prospects that some 20,000 will be
available shortly.
The major sources of these additional
translations are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.788791833333333">
a. French translations from two
projects:
i. approximately 17,500
entries have come from the
Dictionnaire français-japonais Project
(Desperrier, 2002), a project to
translate the most common Japanese
words from the EDICT File into
French;
ii. a further 40,5001i entries
drawn from the TLS 3497&apos; p I&apos;0i
(French-Japanese Complementation
Project) at
http://francais.sourceforge.jp/ (This
project is also based on the EDICT
file.)
b. German translations from the
WaDokuJT Project (Apel, 2002). This is a
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.980558904761905">
large file of over 300,000 entries; however,
unlike JMdict it includes many phrases,
proper nouns and inflected forms of verbs,
etc. The overlap of coverage with JMdict is
quite high, leading to the large number of
entries that have been included in the JMdict
file.
One of the issues that can lead to problems
when incorporating translations from other
project files is that of aligning the
translations when an entry has several
senses. In the case of the French
translations, the project coordinator has
marked the translations of polysemous
entries with a sense code, thus enabling the
translations to be inserted correctly when
compiling the final file. For other languages,
the translations are being appended to the set
English translations. The appropriate
handling of multiple senses is an item of
future work.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.780318" genericHeader="method">
7 Examples of Word Usage
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972869565217">
When the project was begun and the DTD
designed, it was intended that sets of
bilingual examples of usage of the entry
words would be included. For this reason an
&lt;example&gt; element was associated with
each sense to allow for such example
phrases, sentences, etc, to be included.
In practice, a quite different approach has
been taken. With the availability since 2001
of a large corpus of parallel
Japanese/English sentences (Tanaka, 2001),
it was decided to keep the corpus intact, and
instead provide for the association of
selected sentences from the corpus with
dictionary entries via dictionary application
software (Breen, 2003b). This strategy,
which required the corpus to be parsed to
extract a set of index words for each
sentence, has proved effective at the
application level. It also has the advantage
of decoupling the maintenance of the
dictionary file from that of the example
corpus.

<bodyText confidence="0.999985447368421">
Apart from a few small word lists involving
several European languages, the only other
major current project attempting to compile
a comprehensive multilingual database is the
Papillon project (e.g. Boitet et al, 2002). See
http://www.papillon-dictionary.org/ for a
full list of publications. The Papillon design
involves linkages based on word-senses as
proposed in (Sérasset, 1994) with the finer
lexical structure based on Meaning-Text
Theory (MTT) (Mel&apos;cuk, 1984-1996). At the
time of writing the Papillon database is still
in the process of being populated with
lexical information.
Closely related to the JMdict project is the
Japanese-Multilingual Named Entity
Dictionary (JMnedict) project. This is a
database of some 400,000 Japanese place
and person names, and non-Japanese names
in their Japanese orthographical form, along
with a romanized transcription of the
Japanese (Breen, 2004b). Some
geographical names have English
descriptions: cape, island, etc. which are in
the process of being extended to other
languages. The JMnedict file is in an XML
format with a similar structure to JMdict.
Another multilingual lexical database is
KANJIDIC2 (Breen, 2004c), which contains
a wide range of information about the
13,039 kanji in the JIS X 0208, JIS X 0212
and JIS X 0213 character standards. Among
the information for each kanji are the set of
readings in Japanese, Chinese and Korean,
and the broad meanings of each kanji in
English, German and Spanish. A set of
Portuguese meanings is being prepared. The
database is in an XML format.

<bodyText confidence="0.999959214285714">
The JMdict project has successfully
developed a multilingual lexical database
using Japanese as the pivot language. In
doing so, it has reached a lexical coverage
comparable to medium-large printed
dictionaries, and its components are used in
a wide range of applications and research
projects. It has also demonstrated the
potential for re-use of material from related
and cooperating lexicon projects. The files
of the JMdict project are readily available
for use by researchers and developers, and
have the potential to be a significant lexical
resource in a multilingual context.

<abstract confidence="0.998906368421053">The JMdict project has at its aim the compilation of a multilingual lexical database with Japanese as the pivot language. Using an XML structure designed to cater for a mix of languages and a rich set of lexicographic information, it has reached a size of approximately 100,000 entries, with most entries having translations in English, French and German. The compilation involves information re-use, with the French and German translations being drawn from separately maintained lexicons. Material from other languages is also being included. The file is freely available for research purposes and for incorporation in dictionary application software, and is available in several WWW server systems.</abstract>

One of the issues that can lead to problems when incorporating translations from other project files is that of aligning the translations when an entry has several senses. In the case of the French translations, the project coordinator has marked the translations of polysemous entries with a sense code, thus enabling th</context>

It may be viewed as a synthesis of a series of Japanese-Other Language bilingual dictionaries, although, as discussed below, there is merit in having this information collocated. The project grew out of, and has now subsumed, an earlier Japanese-English dictionary project (EDICT: Electronic Dictionary) (Breen, 1995, 2004a). With Japanese being an important language in world trade, and with it being the second most common language used on the WWW, it is not surprising that there is considerable interest in electronic lexical resources for Japanese in combination with other languages. 2 Project Goals and Development As mentioned above, the JMdict project grew out of the bilingual EDICT dictionary project. The EDICT project began in the early 1990s with a relatively simple goal of producing a Japanese-English dictionary file that could be used in basic software packages to provide traditional dictionary se</context>

There are a number of issues associated with the inclusion of material from other dictionary files, in particular those relating to the compilation policies: coverage, handling of inflected forms, etc. (Breen, 2002) There is also the major issue of the editing and maintenance of the material, which has the potential to become more complex as each language is incorporated. The approach taken with JMdict has been to: a. maintain a core Japanese-English file with a well-documented structure and set of inclusion and editing policies; b. encourage the development and maintenance of equivalent files in other languages paired with Japanese, which can draw on the JMdict/EDICT material as required; c. periodically build the complete multi-lingual JMdict from the different components. This approach has proved succ</context>

For this reason an &lt;example&gt; element was associated with each sense to allow for such example phrases, sentences, etc, to be included. In practice, a quite different approach has been taken. With the availability since 2001 of a large corpus of parallel Japanese/English sentences (Tanaka, 2001), it was decided to keep the corpus intact, and instead provide for the association of selected sentences from the corpus with dictionary entries via dictionary application software (Breen, 2003b).
