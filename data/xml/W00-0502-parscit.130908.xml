Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942764705882">
The importance of machine translation (MT)
in the stream of text-handling processes has
become readily apparent in many current
production settings as well as in research
programs such as the Translingual
Information Detection, Extraction, and
Summarization (TIDES) program. The MT
Proficiency Scale project has developed a
means of baselining the inherent &amp;quot;tolerance&amp;quot;
that a text-handling task has for raw MT
output, and thus how good the output must be
in order to be of use to that task. This method
allows for a prediction of how useful a
particular system can be in a text-handling
process stream, whether in integrated, MT-
embedded processes, or less integrated user-
intensive processes.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998950129032258">
Issues of evaluation have been pre-eminent in
MT since its beginning, yet there are no
measures or metrics which are universally
accepted as standard or adequate. This is in
part because, at present, different evaluation
methods are required to measure different
attributes of MT, depending on what a
particular stakeholder needs to know (e.g.,
Arnold 1993). A venture capitalist who wants
to invest in an MT start-up needs to know a
different set of attributes about the system than
does a developer who needs to see if the most
recent software changes improved (or
degraded) the system. Users need to know
another set of metrics, namely those associated
with whether the MT system in situ improves
or degrades the other tasks in their overall
process. Task-based evaluation of this sort is
of particular value because of the recently
envisioned role of MT as an embedded part of
production processes rather than a stand-alone
translator&apos;s tool. In this context, MT can be
measured in terms of its effect on the
&amp;quot;downstream&amp;quot; tasks, i.e., the tasks that a user
or system performs on the output of the MT.
The assertion that usefulness could be
gauged by tasks to which output might be
applied has been used for systems and for
processes (JEIDA 1992, Albisser 1993), and
also particular theoretical approaches (Church
and Hovy 1991). However, the potential for
rapidly adaptable systems for which MT could
be expected to run without human
intervention, and to interact flexibly with
automated extraction, summarization, filtering,
and document detection calls for an evaluation.
method that measures usefulness across several
different downstream tasks.
The U.S. government MT Functional
Proficiency Scale project has conducted
methodology research that has resulted in a
ranking of text-handling tasks by their
tolerance to MT output. When an MT
system&apos;s output is mapped onto this scale, the
set of tasks for which the output is useful, or
not useful, can be predicted. The method used
to develop the scale can also be used to map a
particular system onto the scale.
Development of the scale required the
identification of the text-handling tasks
members of a user community perform, and
then the development of exercises to test
output from several MT systems (Japanese-to-
English). The level of ease users can perform
these exercises on the corpus reflects the
tolerance that the tasks have for MT output of
varying quality. The following sections detail
the identification of text-handling tasks, the
evaluation corpus, exercise development, â€¢ and
inference of the proficiency scale .from the
apparent tolerance of the downstream text-
handling tasks.

In order to determine the suitability of MT
output for text-handling tasks, it was necessary
to interview users of text-handling tools to
identify the tasks they actually perform with
translated material. It was necessary also to
compile a corpus of translations and create
exercises to measure the usefulness of the
translations.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998284">
Expert user judgments were needed to ensure
confidence in the resulting proficiency scale.
The users who provided these judgments work
monolingually on document collections that
include translated material. Preliminary
interviews were conducted with 17 users.
During the preliminary interviews, users
completed questionnaires providing
information identifying the text-handling tasks
that ultimately formed the proficiency scale.

2.2 Corpus Composition

<bodyText confidence="0.999859958333333">
For a 1994 evaluation effort, the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
Machine Translation Initiative developed a
corpus of 100 general news texts taken from
Japanese newswires. These texts were
translated into English and were incorporated
into what is now known as the &amp;quot;3Q94&amp;quot;
evaluation. A subset of these translations was
used for the MT Functional Proficiency Scale
project.
The 100 3Q94 Japanese source texts were
translated into six English output versions,
four from commercial and research MT
systems (Systran (SY), Pivot (P), Lingstat (L),
and Pangloss (PN)), and two from professional
expert translations (E) used as baseline and
control for the 3Q94 evaluations.
Translations were selected from all of these
sets for the proficiency scale corpus. For the
purpose of validating the project&apos;s results, two
additional systems&apos; translations were added to
its corpus. These included translations from a
current version of Systran (SY2) and Typhoon
(TY).

2.3 Exercise Definitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999897">
The user exercises were designed to determine
if users could successfully accomplish their
regular tasks with translations of varying
qualities, by eliciting judgments that indicated
the usefulness of these translations. A variety
of human factors issues were relevant to the
development of the exercise sets. Since the
texts to be seen by the users were general news
texts, it was unlikely they would be relevant to
the users&apos; usual domains of interest (White and
Taylor, 1998 and Taylor and White, 1998).
This issue was handled by selecting texts
related to domains that were thought to be
similar, but broader, than those typically
handled by users (White and Taylor, 1998 and
Taylor and White, 1998). Additionally, the
simple elicitation of a judgment (to a question
such as &amp;quot;can you do your job with this text&amp;quot;)
is possibly biased by a predisposition to
cooperate (Taylor and White 1998).
Therefore, it was necessary to develop two
complementary sets of exercises: the snap
judgment exercise and the task-specific
exercises. Detailed definitions of these two
exercises can be found in Kathryn B. Taylor
and John S. White&apos;s paper &amp;quot;Predicting What
MT is Good for: User Judgments and Task
Performance&amp;quot; in the Proceedings of the Third
Conference of the Association for Machine
Translation in the Americas, AMTA &apos;98.

<bodyText confidence="0.999975869565217">
The user responses for the snap judgment
exercise are shown in Exhibit 1. In the snap
judgment exercise, the users were asked to
look at 15 translations and categorize each as
being of a good enough quality to
successfully complete their text-handling task,
i.e., &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Y,&amp;quot; or if they could not use
the translation to perform their task, i.e.,
&amp;quot;NO&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;N.&amp;quot; The top row of Exhibit 1 lists
the 15 translations by their document
identification codes. Each document
identification code includes a document
number followed by the code of the MT
system that produced it (MT system codes can
be found in the Corpus Composition section
above). The first column of Exhibit 1
contains a list of the users who participated in
the snap judgment exercise separated by which
text-handling task they performed. The users&apos;
responses of &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; appear under each
of the translations&apos; document identification
codes by user. The snap judgment scores for
each of the text handling tasks was calculated

as the percentage of &amp;quot;Ys&amp;quot; for the corpus of 15
translations by all users performing that task.
The user responses and results for the gisting
exercise are shown in Exhibit 2. In the gisting
exercise, each user was asked to rate decision
points in a translation on a 1-5 scale. The top
row of Exhibit 2 lists the seven documents
seen by the users by their document
identification codes. The first column of
Exhibit 2 contains a list of users who
participated in the gisting exercise. User
ratings averaged for each translation appear
under each of the translation codes for each of
the users. The scores for each of the
translations were calculated by totaling a user&apos;s
ratings and dividing that total by the number
of decision points contained in the document.
The user responses and results for the triage
exercise are shown in Exhibit 3. In the triage
exercise, each user was asked to order three
separate stacks of translations by their
relevance to a problem statement. The top row
of Exhibit 3 lists the 15 translations seen by
the users by their document identification
codes. The first column of Exhibit 3 contains
a list of users who participated in the triage
exercise. User responses of ordinal number
rankings appear under each of the document
identification codes by user. Each of the
category rankings was scored by comparing its
results to that of a ground truth ranking of the
same translations.
The user responses and results for the
extraction exercise are shown in Exhibit 4. In
the extraction exercise, each user was asked to
identify named entities in each translation:
persons, locations, organizations, dates, times,
and money/percent. This extraction exercise
was modeled after the &amp;quot;Named Entity&amp;quot; task
of the Message Understanding Conference
(MUC) (Chinchor and Dungca, 1995).
Exhibit 4 contains two charts. The top row of
both charts contain a list of users who
participated in the extraction exercise. The
first column of both charts lists seven
documents seen by the users by their
document identification codes. In the top
chart, recall scores appear under each of the
users for each translation. In the bottom chart,
precision scores appear under each of the
users for each translation. Recall was
calculated by the number of possible named
entities in a translation the user identified.
Precision was calculated by the number of
items the user identified as being named
entities that were actually named entities.
The user responses and results for the
filtering exercise are shown in Exhibit 5. In
the filtering exercise, each user was asked to
look at 15 documents to determine if a
document fit into any one of the three
categories of Crime, Economics, or
Government and Politics, i.e., &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Y,&amp;quot;
none of the three categories, i.e., &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;N,&amp;quot; or if they could not make a decision
either way, i.e., &amp;quot;CANNOT BE
DETERMINED&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;CBD.&amp;quot; Exhibit 5
contains two charts. The top row of both
charts lists the 15 translations seen by the users
by their document identification codes. The
first column of both charts contains a list of
users who participated in the filtering exercise.
The users&apos; responses of &amp;quot;Y,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;N,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;CBD&amp;quot;
appear under each of the translations&apos;
document identification codes by user. The
results of the filtering exercise were calculated
with the measure of recall. Recall was
calculated by the number of translated
documents related to the three categories of
Crime, Economics, and Government and
Politics the user identified.
The user responses and results for the
detection exercise are shown in Exhibit 6. In
the detection exercise, each user was asked to
look at 15 documents to determine if the.
document belonged to the category of Crime
(C), the category of Economics (E), the
category of Government and Politics (G&amp;P),
none of the three categories, i.e., &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;N,&amp;quot; or if they could not make a decision
either way, i.e., &amp;quot;CANNOT BE
DETERMINED&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;CBD.&amp;quot; Exhibit 6
contains three charts. The top row of all three
charts lists the 15 translations seen by the users
by their document identification codes. The
first column of all three charts contains a list
of users who participated in the detection
exercise. User responses of &amp;quot;C,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;E,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;G&amp;P,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;CBD,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;NOTA&amp;quot; appear under
each of the translations&apos; document
identification codes by user. The results of the
detection exercise were calculated with the
measure of recall. Recall was calculated by the
number of translated documents related to
each of the three categories of Crime,
Economics, and Government and Politics the
user identified.

The bars in Exhibit 7 represent the
percentage of affirmatives for the corpus of 15
texts by all users.
The results for the user exercises needed be
computed in a way which allowed their
comparison across tasks, but which used the
metrics relevant to each task at the same time.
We address the computation of each of these
in turn.
Gisting. Computing the acceptability cut-off
for gisting follows the general pattern, except
that the text scores are not recall or precision.
Rather, since gisting judgments were elicited
with an &amp;quot;adequacy&amp;quot; measure, each text for each
user has an average of the scores for the
decision points in that text. In turn, the
average of these average scores gives the
cutoff for acceptability for gisting, namely
2.52 out of a minimum of one and maximum
of 5. By this means, 2 texts are identified as
acceptable for gisting, indicated in Exhibit 2.
Triage. As shown in Exhibit 3, triage
requires the comparison of ordinal rankings,
with ordinal rankings from the ground truth
set. Here, a uniformity of agreement measure
was established, defined as the mean of the
standard deviations for each text in each
problem statement. Then the mean for each
text in the user ranking was compared to the
ground truth ranking, plus-or-minus the
uniformity measure. A text is acceptable if it
matches the ground truth within the
uniformity measure. Based on this
computation, 7 of 15, or 46.7%, of the texts
are acceptable for gisting.
Extraction. Extraction was computed using
both recall and precision measures. As with
filtering and detection, average recall is
computed (62%), which is used as the cut-off
for acceptability, and identifies 3 texts as
acceptable. Similarly, the average precision,
87.7%, creates a cut-off at 4 texts. To show
extraction as a single value, the total acceptable
in precision and in recall are averaged,
equaling 3.5, or 50% of the texts in the 7-text
set. These are shown in Exhibit 4.
Filtering. For filtering, user responses are
computed on two tables conforming to the
ground truth values for each text (&amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;N&amp;quot;,
i.e., whether the text was relevant to crime or
not). The average recall over all users and all
texts is 66.7% for Y and 75% for N. These
averages create for the Y and N chart the
respective cutoff boundaries for &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot; (text
output is acceptable for filtering) and &amp;quot;NO&amp;quot; (it
is not). The total number of YES&apos;s from the Y
and N tables is 8 or 53% of the texts in the
corpus acceptable for filtering. These results
are illustrated in Exhibit 5.
Detection. As shown in Exhibit 6, there are
three tables in detection, corresponding to the
three domain areas of Crime, Economics, and
Government and Politics. As with filtering, the
average recall is computed for each domain
over all users and texts, and this average
establishes the cut-off boundary of
acceptability of text outputs for detection. For
the Crime domain, the average is 82.1%, for
Economics 94%, and for Government and
Politics 50%. The total number of texts thus
identified as acceptable is 10, or 67% texts
acceptable for detection.
Exhibit 8 shows the results of the task
exercises.

At the inception of this project, we
established a heuristic scale of task tolerance,
based on common understanding of the nature
of each of these tasks. This scale â€” filtering,
detection, triage, extraction, and gisting, in
order of tolerance â€” was not a hypothesis per
se; nevertheless, it is rather surprising that the
results vary from the heuristic significantly.
The results showed detection to be the most
tolerant task, rather than filtering. The
presumption had been that the filtering task,
which simply requires a &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; if a document
is related to a specific topic or &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; if it is
not, could be performed with higher accuracy
than the task of detection that requires
classifying each document by subject matter.
In fact, when precision measures are factored
in for filtering and detection (as they were for
extraction), filtering appears to be even less
tolerant than extraction. This outcome seems
plausible when we consider that detection is
often possible even when only small quantities
of key words can be found in a document.
Also surprising, the triage task was less
tolerant of MT output then expected. It was
supposed that the ability to rank relevance to a
particular problem could be done with
sufficient keywords in otherwise unintelligible
text; rather, a greater depth of understanding is
necessary to successfully complete this task.

There are at least two evaluation techniques
that can use the task tolerance scale to predict
the usefulness of an MT system for a
particular downstream task. The set of
exercises used to elicit the task tolerance
hierarchy reported here can also be used to
determine the position on the scale of a
particular system. The system translates texts
from the corpus for which ground truth has
already been established, and the user
exercises are performed on these translations.
The result is a set of tasks for which the
system&apos;s output appears to be suitable. The
pre-existing scale can help to resolve
ambiguous results, or can be used to make
scale-wide inferences from a subset of the
exercises: it may be possible to perform just
one exercise (e.g., triage) and infer the actual
position of the system on the scale by the
degree of acceptability above or below the
minimum acceptability for triage itself.
A second technique offers more potential
for rapid, inexpensive test and re-test. This
involves the development of a diagnostic test
set (White and Taylor 1998, Taylor and White
1998), derived from the same source as the
proficiency scale itself. For every task in the
exercise results, there are &amp;quot;borderline&amp;quot; texts,
that is, texts acceptable for one task but not for
the next less tolerant task. These texts will
exhibit translation phenomena (grammatical,
lexical, orthographic, formatting, etc.) which
are diagnostic of the difference between
suitability at one tolerance level and another.
The text will also contain phenomena that are
not diagnostic at this level but are at a less
tolerant level. By characterizing the
phenomena that occur in the border texts for
each task, it is possible to determine the
phenomena diagnostic to each tolerance level.
A pilot investigation of these translation
phenomena (Taylor and White 1998, Doyon et
al. 1999) categorized the translation
phenomena in terms of pedagogy-based
descriptions of the contrasts between Japanese
and English (Connor-Linton 1995). This
characterization allows for the representation
of several individual problem instances with a
single suite of pair-specific, controlled, source
language patterns designed to test MT systems
for coverage of each phenomenon. These
patterns may be tested by any MT system for
that language pair, and the results of the test
will indicate where that system falls on the
proficiency scale by its successful coverage of
the diagnostic patterns associated with that
tolerance level.
The purpose of the user exercises is to
establish a scale of MT tolerance for the
downstream text handling tasks. However, the
same method can be used to determine the
usefulness of a particular system for any of
the tasks by performing these exercises with
the system to be tested. It is possible, for
example, to isolate the performance of systems
in the set used here, though the sample size
from each system is too small to draw any
conclusions in this case. We hope to perform
this exercises with larger samples both to
validate these findings and to execute
evaluations on candidate MT systems.
Among other validation steps in the future
will be confirmation of the exercise approach
from an empirical perspective (e.g., whether to
include &amp;quot;cannot be determined&amp;quot; as a choice),
and a validation of the ground truth in the
triage exercise.
Finally, we continue to refine the application
of the methodology to reduce time and
increase user acceptance. In particular, we
have developed a web-based version of several
of the exercises to make the process easier for
the user and more automatic for scoring.

The MT Functional Proficiency Scale project
has not only demonstrated that it is possible
for poor MT output to be of use for certain
text-handling tasks, but has also indicated the
different tolerances each such task has for
possibly poor MT output.
This task-based methodology developed in
the MT Functional Proficiency Scale project
using Japanese-to-English corpora should
prove useful in evaluating other language pair
systems. There is also potential for evaluating
other text-handling systems, such as
summarization, information retrieval, gisting,
and information extraction, in the context of
the other tasks that might process their output.
Task-based evaluations provide a direct way
for understanding how text-handling
technologies can interact with each other in
end-to-end processes. In the case of MT
systems, it is possible to predict the effective
applicability of MT systems whose output
seems far less than perfect.

<abstract confidence="0.998555222222222">The importance of machine translation (MT) in the stream of text-handling processes has become readily apparent in many current production settings as well as in research programs such as the Translingual Information Detection, Extraction, and Summarization (TIDES) program. The MT Proficiency Scale project has developed a means of baselining the inherent &amp;quot;tolerance&amp;quot; that a text-handling task has for raw MT output, and thus how good the output must be in order to be of use to that task. This method allows for a prediction of how useful a particular system can be in a text-handling process stream, whether in integrated, MTembedded processes, or less integrated userintensive processes.</abstract>

In the extraction exercise, each user was asked to identify named entities in each translation: persons, locations, organizations, dates, times, and money/percent.
