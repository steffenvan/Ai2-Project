ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996335">
In this paper we discuss a mechanism for
modifying context in a tutorial dialogue. The context
mechanism imposes a pedagogically motivated
misrepresentation (PMM) on a dialogue to achieve
instructional goals. In the paper, we outline several
types of PMMs and detail a particular PMM in a
sample dialogue situation. While the notion of
PMMs are specifically oriented towards tutorial
dialogue, misrepresentation has interesting
implications for context in dialogue situations
generally, and also suggests that Grice&apos;s maxim of
quality needs to be modified.

Most of the time, truth is a wonderful thing.
However, this research studies situations where not
saying what you believe to be the truth can be the
best course of action. Intentional misrepresentation
of a speaker&apos;s knowledge appears to be a common and
highly pragmatic process used in many different kinds
of dialogue, especially tutorial dialogue.
We use imperfect or incomplete representations in
response to constraints and demands imposed by the
situation: for example, many models of the real
world are extremely complex, and misrepresentations
are often used as useful, comprehensible
approximations of complicated systems. People use
idealized Newtonian mechanics, the wave (or particle)
theory of light, and rules of default reasoning stating
that birds fly, penguins are birds, and penguins don&apos;t
fly. Some systems which cannot be simplified are
purposefully ignored: for example, higher order

differential equations are left out of engineering
classes because of their complexity. Simplified and
imperfect representations are often found in tutoring
discourse.
Misrepresentation as a pedagogic strategy holds
promise for extending the capabilities of intelligent
tutoring systems (ITS s), but the concept also affects
computational dialogue research: it builds on the
idea of discourse focus and context, extends work on
adapting to the user with multiple representations of
knowledge, and challenges Grice&apos;s maxims of
conversation.

2. MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998854083333334">
Misrepresentations are alterations to a perceived
reality. When they have sincere pedagogic purposes,
we name them Pedagogically Motivated
Misrepresentations, or PMMs. PMMs can reduce the
complexity of the dialogue and of the concepts to be
learned, provide focus in a busy environment, or
facilitate the communication of essential knowledge.
PMMs share themes with research into
computational dialogue and ITS. PMMs are
intimately connected to ideas of instructional and
dialogue focus, the latter of which was explored by
Grosz [1977], who stated that task-oriented dialogue
could be organized into focus spaces, each containing
a subset of the dialogue&apos;s purposes and entities. The
collection of focus spaces created by the changing
dynamics of a dialogue could be gathered together into
a focusing structure which assisted in interpreting new
utterances.
Adaptation to the hearer is also a concern in
dialogue research: beliefs about the hearer or about the
situation can be used to vary the structure,
complexity, and language of discourse to optimally
suit the hearer. Several projects (e.g. [McKeown et al
1985], [Moore &amp; Swartout 1989], [Paris 1989]) have
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996283">

<bodyText confidence="0.99974697826087">
looked at adapting the level or tenor of explanations
to a user&apos;s needs. Paris&apos;s [1989] TAILOR system
varies its output (descriptions of complex devices)
depending upon the hearer&apos;s expertise.
Another concern in both dialogue research and ITS
research is multiple representations of domain
knowledge. TAILOR, for example, uses two different
models of each device to construct its explanations.
Tutoring systems like SMITHTOWN [Shute and
Bonar 1986] and MHO [Lesgold et al. 1987] organize
different representations around distinct pedagogic
goals; in the domain of electrical circuits, QUEST
[Frederiksen &amp; White 1988] provides progressively
more sophisticated representations, from a simple
qualitative model to quantitative circuit theory.
Lastly, any discussion of misrepresentation in
dialogue is bound to reflect on Grice&apos;s first maxim of
quality, &amp;quot;do not say that which you believe to be
false.&amp;quot; The conversational maxims of H. Paul Grice
[1977] are a well-known set of observations about
human discourse frequently used in computational
dialogue research (for example [Joshi et al 1984],
[Moore and Paris 1989], [Reichman 1985]).
However, people sometimes accept the truth of
Grice&apos;s maxims too easily. A close examination
reveals difficulties with a literal interpretation of the
first maxim of quality. While this maxim seems a
reasonable rule to use in dialogue, examination of
human discourse shows many instances where
uttering falsehoods is legitimate behaviour. For
example, in some first year computer science courses,
students are told that a semicolon is the terminator of
a Pascal statement. This utterance misrepresents
reality (a semicolon actually separates statements),
but the underlying purpose is sincere: the
misrepresentation allows students to begin
programming without forcing them to learn about
syntax charts, parsing algorithms, or recursive
definitions. Grice&apos;s maxims have avoided major
criticism by the computational dialogue community,
and the maxims have been successfully used in
limited domains to help dialogue systems interact
with their users. Realizing that misrepresentations
often occur in tutorial discourse, however, provides us
with a context for investigating limits to the Gricean
approach.

3. OVERVIEW OF PEDAGOGICALLY
MOTIVATED MISREPRESENTATIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926454545454">
We have identified and characterized several types
of PMM that can occur in tutorial discourse. We
define each type as a computational structure that,
when invoked, alters the dialogue system&apos;s own
reality and hence the student&apos;s perception of reality,
for sincere pedagogic purposes. There are five
essential computational characteristics governing the
use of PMMs: preconditions, applicability
conditions, removal conditions, revelation conditions,
and effects.
These conditions are predicates matched against
information in the dialogue system&apos;s essential data
structures: a domain knowledge representation (in
this system, a granularity hierarchy after [Greer and
McCalla 1989], as shown in Figure 1); a model of the
student; and an instructional plan (in this system, a
simplified version of Brecht&apos;s (1990) content planner,
from which a sample partial plan is shown in Figure
2). Each step in the instructional plan provides a
teaching operator (such as prepare-to-teach) and a
concept from the knowledge base which becomes the
focus of the instructional interaction.

In this implementation, PMMs act by
manipulating the dialogue system&apos;s blackboard-based
internal communication. An active PMM intercepts
relevant messages before the knowledge base can
receive them, then returns misrepresented information
instead of the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; information to the blackboard.

The first step in using a misrepresentation
involves the PMM&apos;s preconditions and applicability
conditions. Preconditions are definitional constraints
characterizing situations in which a particular PMM
is conceivable. Applicability conditions actually
determine the suitability of a PMM to a situation.
Each applicability condition examines one element of
the current instructional context, from the student
model, the domain representation, or the instructional
plan. The individual conditions are combined to
determine a final &amp;quot;score&amp;quot; for the PMM, using a
calculus akin to MYCIN&apos;s certainty factors
([Shortliffe 1976]). For example, one applicability
condition states that less student knowledge about a
domain concept can provide evidence for the PMM&apos;s
greater applicability, and more knowledge implies less
applicability.
A PMM&apos;s removal conditions provide a facility for
determining when the misrepresentation is no longer
useful and may be removed. However, a dialogue
system also needs to know when a PMM is not
working well; after all, there are certain dangers
associated with the use of misrepresentations. For
example, a student may realize the discrepancy
between the altered environment and reality. These
situations are monitored by a PMM&apos;s revelation
conditions, guiding the system in cases where it must
be ready to abandon the misrepresentation and reveal
the misrepresentation.
If preconditions and applicability conditions are
satisfied, a PMM&apos;s procedural effects can be applied to
the domain representation, implementing the
&apos;alternative reality&apos; presented to the student through
the dialogue.
The way in which the student&apos;s perceived
environment is altered and restored plays a crucial part
in a misrepresentation&apos;s success. The dialogue actions
which accomplish these changes compose two unique
subdialogues. An alteration subdialogue must make a
smooth transition to the altered environment; a
restoration subdialogue has the opposite effect: it
must restore the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; environment, knot all the
loose ends created by the misrepresentation, and help
the student transfer knowledge from the
misrepresented environment to the real environment.
Restoration subdialogues must guard against another
potential danger of misrepresentation: that students
may retain incorrect information even after the
misrepresentation has been retracted at the close of the
learning episode.

4. DETAILS OF THE PMM MODEL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940838709677">
We have identified several types of pedagogic
misrepresentations, and have implemented and
evaluated them in a partial tutorial dialogue system.
The implemented system concentrates on the function
of the misrepresentation expert, and therefore the
dialogue system is not fully functional: for example,
it does not process or generate surface natural
language. We have implemented the
misrepresentation expert and the PMM structures, the
blackboard communication architecture, the student
model, and the domain knowledge (see Figure 1). The
content planner and other system components are
implemented as shells able to provide necessary
information when needed.
Input to the system is a teaching situation
including information from the content planner, the
student model, and the domain. The system&apos;s output
is a log of system actions detailing the simulation of
the teaching situation.
Figure 3 shows the organization of the
implemented PMMs, some of which inherit shared
conditions and effects. The implemented PMMs have
a variety of uses: Ignore-Specializations PMM
simplifies concepts by reducing the number of kinds
that a concept has; Compress-Redirect PMM
collapses a part of the granularity hierarchy to allow
specific instantiations of general concepts. There are
also extended versions of these two PMMs which
have more wide-reaching effects. The remaining
PMMs are Entrapment PMM, which uses a
misconception to corner a student and add weight to

Explanation PMM, which reduces the complexity of a
concept&apos;s functional explanation. The remaining
restriction PMM, Restrict-Peripheral PMM, is
detailed in the following section to illustrate the
concept of misrepresentation and the elements of the
PMM model, and to show the PMM&apos;s use in an
actual dialogue.

The purpose of the &amp;quot;Restrict Peripheral Concepts&amp;quot;
PMM is to simplify concepts related to the current
teaching concept. For example, during an initial
discussion of base cases (while learning programming
in Lisp), a student might benefit from a
misrepresentation which restricts recursive cases to a
single type, the variety of recursive case used with cdr
recursion. The restriction allows both participants in
the dialogue to discuss and refer to a single common
object, and allows the student to concentrate on base
cases without needing to know the complexities of
recursive cases.
This PMM&apos;s preconditions check that there are
peripheral concepts in the current instructional
context. Applicability conditions determine whether
those concepts should be simplified, by considering
the domain&apos;s pedagogic complexity and the student&apos;s
capabilities. For example, the PMM considers the
difficulty ratings of the current concept and the
peripheral concept, the student&apos;s knowledge of these
concepts and any existing difficulties with them as
shown in the student model. In addition, the PMM
considers other factors such as the student&apos;s anxiety
level and their ability with structural relationships.
Removal conditions for this PMM consider factors
such as whether or not instruction about the current
concept has been completed, or whether the
instructional context has changed so markedly that the
PMM can no longer be useful. Revelation conditions
cover two other cases for a PMM&apos;s removal: when
the student challenges the misrepresentation, and
when the student or another part of the dialogue
system requires a hidden part of the domain.
If applied, the effect of this PMM is to restrict
peripheral concepts related to the current concept such
that all but one of their specializations are hidden.
The PMM carries out the restriction, but does not
choose the specializations that will remain visible:
that decision is left to the pedagogic expert, using the
instructional plan and the student model.

S. EXAMPLE DIALOGUE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985049375">
PMM &amp;quot;Restrict Peripheral Concepts&amp;quot; is illustrated
below in an example dialogue. The dialogue is based
on an actual trial of the implemented system, which
determined when to invoke the PMM, when to revoke
it, and all the interactions between the knowledge base
and the dialogue system. However, the surface
utterances are fabricated to illustrate how the
misrepresentation system would function in a
completed tutorial discourse system.
The teaching domain in the dialogue is recursion
in Lisp (as shown in Figure 1), and the system
believes the student to be a novice Lisp programmer.
T: ... the next thing I&apos;d like to show you is the part
of recursion that stops the reduction.
The system&apos;s current instructional context contains a
teaching operator, &amp;quot;prepare to teach x,&amp;quot; and a current
concept, &amp;quot;base case.&amp;quot; The current situation satisfies
the preconditions of PMM &amp;quot;Restrict Peripheral
Concepts,&amp;quot; and its applicability score ranks it as most
applicable to the situation. The PMM thus
determines that the peripheral concept &amp;quot;recursive case&amp;quot;
will be restricted to one specialization, and the
pedagogic expert chooses &apos;cdr recursive case&apos; as the
most appropriate specialization for novice students.
The system asks the instructional planner to
replan given the altered view of the domain, and enters
into an alteration subdialogue with the student.
Although these subdialogues are only represented as
stubs in the system&apos;s internal notation, the discourse
could proceed as follows:
T: Do you remember the last example you saw?
S: Yes.

T: OK. Remember that I pointed out the parts of the
recursive function, the base case and the recursive
case?
S: Yup.
T: Great. Now, I&apos;ll just put that example back on for
a second. You&apos;ll notice that the recursive case looks
like &amp;quot;(t (allnums (cdr liszt)))&amp;quot; Got that?
S: Yup.
T: Ok. For when we look at the base case, I want
you to assume that this recursive case is the only kind
of recursive case that there is. Then when we write
some programs, you won&apos;t have to worry about the
recursive case part. Does that sound ok?
[At this point the system has already imposed its
alteration on the knowledge base, and when the
system asks for the specializations of &apos;recursive case,&apos;
it will receive only &apos;cdr recursive case&apos; as an answer.]
S: Sure.
T: Great. So the thing to remember is, whenever
you need a recursive case, use a recursive case like
you have in the example.
So. Let&apos;s move on to looking at the way the base
case works; let&apos;s start with that example we had up.
First, you identify the base case...
Later in the dialogue, the student is constructing a
solution to another problem:
S: I&apos;m not sure about the base case for this one ... I
think I&apos;ll do the recursive case first. What does the
recursive case do again?
T: A recursive case reduces the problem by calling
the function again with reduced input. The recursive
case is the default case of the &amp;quot;cond&amp;quot; statement, and it
calls the function again with the cdr of the list input.
[Here the PMM again alters perceived reality,
restricting &apos;recursive case&apos; to &apos;cdr recursive case]
S: Right. So the recursive case is (t (findb (cdr
liszt)))?
T: Yep.
[The PMM is again used to verify the student&apos;s
query.]
S: OK. Now the base case ...
This exchange shows that the misrepresentation is
useful in focusing the dialogue on the current concept
of base case, by making the recursive case easy to
synthesize.
The system continues investigating and teaching
base case until the student can analyse and synthesize
simple base cases. The instructional plan then raises
its next step, &amp;quot;complete base case.&amp;quot; Arrival at this
plan step satisfies one of the removal conditions for
the PMM, so the system engages in a restoration
subdialogue with the student, which might go as
follows, preparing the student for the next context:
T: Ok. The next thing we&apos;ll do is look a little closer
at recursive case. Although I told you that there was
only one kind of recursive case, there are actually
more. The reason we only used one kind of recursive
case is because I wanted to make sure you learned the
way a base case works without needing all the details
of recursive cases. Recursive cases still do the same
thing (that is, reducing the input) but the specific
parts might do different things than the recursive case
we used. Does that sound ok to you?
S: ok.
T: So let&apos;s look at recursive cases. We&apos;ll only deal
with the kinds used with cdr recursion. ...

6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969689655172">
Evaluative trials for the PMM system have been
aimed specifically at both the individual PMMs and
the PMM model. Twenty-six different types of
situations have been designed to test the PMMs&apos;
relevance, consistence, and coherence. Through these
trials the individual PMMs demonstrated their
integrity, and the PMM model itself was shown to be
capable of working within a dialogue system
architecture. Full details of evaluation methodology
and results can be found in [Gutwin 1991].
This research project has shown that PMMs can
be represented for use in a tutorial dialogue system,
and supports their value as a pedagogic tool.
However, the foremost contribution of the PMM
system to computational dialogue may be how it
extends the notion of focus currently used in dialogue
research. Grosz and Sidner [1986] see dialogue as a
collection of focus spaces which shift in reaction to
changes in the discourse&apos;s purposes and salient
entities. This research suggests that within any of
these focus spaces, there can exist a further structure:
a context that provides a specific interpretation of the
knowledge represented in the system. The same
knowledge is &amp;quot;in focus&amp;quot; throughout the focus space,
but different contexts can color or interpret that
knowledge in different ways. A pedagogically
motivated misrepresentation is thus a context
mechanism that alters the domain knowledge for an
educational purpose. It is possible that we always use
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996201">
156
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980015873016">
some kind of alternate interpretation or
misrepresentation to mediate between our knowledge
and other dialogue participants.
Focusing structure has traditionally been used in
interpretation: in several projects ([Grosz 1977],
[Sidner 1983]), context structures are shown to be
useful in tasks like pronoun resolution or anaphora
resolution. Pragmatic contexts, such as those created
by a PMM, can direct generation of discourse as well.
They are active reflections of the larger situation,
rather than local representations of dialogue structure,
and they are able to alter the discourse in order to
further some goal. Responding to patterns in the
world outside the dialogue allows pragmatic context
mechanisms such as PMMs to consider fitness and
suitability of a dialogue situation in addition to a
focus space&apos;s subset of goals and salient entities.
Another issue of importance to this research is
that of tailoring. While some existing dialogue
systems tailor an explanation to the user&apos;s level of
expertise (e.g. [Paris 1989], [McKeown et al 1985]),
the PMM system instead tailors the domain to the
learner. The PMM system does not make basic
decisions about either content or delivery in a
dialogue, but attempts to shape the content&apos;s
representation into a form which will be best suited to
the learning situation.
The PMM model also touches on research into
multiple representation, in that it provides a
mechanism for encapsulating several different
interpretations of a knowledge base. The mechanism
might be able to model and administer alternate
representations of other kinds as well, such as
analogy.
The usefulness and ubiquity of PMMs also
suggests that a literal interpretation of Grice&apos;s
maxims, particularly the maxim of quality, is
inappropriate. Clearly, we often say things we know
to be false! However, the maxim of quality can be
rescued by indicating the relationship between truth
and dialogue purposes: from the original, &amp;quot;do not say
that which you believe to be false,&amp;quot; we create a new
maxim, &amp;quot;do not say that which you believe to be false
to your purposes.&amp;quot; The new maxim shifts emphasis
from an absolute standard of truth in dialogue to the
more pragmatic idea of truth relative to a dialogue&apos;s
goals, and better reflects the way humans actually use
discourse.
Much remains to be accomplished in this research.
There are undoubtedly other as yet undiscovered
PMMs. The notion of intentional misrepresentation
itself may just be an instance of a more general
context mechanism that underlies all dialogue, an idea
that should be explored by considering other kinds of
dialogue from the perspective of PMMs, and by a
closer examination of existing theories of discourse
context. Finally, all of the oracles used in the PMM
system should be replaced by functioning components
so that a dialogue system with complete capabilities
can stand alone as proof of the PMM concept.
Nevertheless, this research points the way towards the
possibility of a new and widely applicable mechanism
for modelling dialogue.

<abstract confidence="0.999381384615385">In this paper we discuss a mechanism for modifying context in a tutorial dialogue. The context mechanism imposes a pedagogically motivated misrepresentation (PMM) on a dialogue to achieve instructional goals. In the paper, we outline several types of PMMs and detail a particular PMM in a sample dialogue situation. While the notion of PMMs are specifically oriented towards tutorial dialogue, misrepresentation has interesting implications for context in dialogue situations generally, and also suggests that Grice&apos;s maxim of quality needs to be modified.</abstract>
