Corepresentational Grammar and Parsing English Comparatives
Karen Ryan
University of Minnesota
SEC. 1 INTRODUCTION
Marcus [3] notes that the syntax of English comparative
constructions is highly complex, and claims that both
syntactic and semantic information must be available for
them to be parsed. This paper argues that comparatives
can be structurally analyzed on the basis of syntactic
Information alone via a strictly surface-based grammar.
Such a grammar is given in Ryan [5], based on the co-
representational model of Kac [1]. While the grammar
does not define a parsing algorithm per se, it nonethe-
less expresses regularities of surface organization and
Its relationship to semantic interpretation that an ade-
quate parser would be expected to incorporate. This
paper will discuss four problem areas in the description
of comparatives and will outline the sections of the
grammar of [5] that apply to them.
The central problem in parsing comparatives involves
identifying the arguments of comparative predicates, and
the relations borne by these arguments to such predi-
cates. A corepresentational grammar is explicitly de-
signed to assign predicate-argument structure to sen-
tences on the basis of their surface syntactic organi-
zation.
SEC. 2 COMPARATIVE PREDICATES
An initial assumption underlying the proposed analysis
of.comparatives is that the comparative elements such as
more, faster, more spacious, are syntactically akin to
[Vacates, and thus that the principles applying to
predicate-argument structure extend to them. Each com-
parative element will accordingly have arguments (Subject
and Object) assigned to it, and comparative predications
will also be analyzed as being in relations of subordin-
ation or superordination with other predications in the
sentences in which they appear. For example, in (1)
below, the comparative predicate richer will have both a
simple NP Subject and a simple NP Object:

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.874769428571429">
SUBJ OBJ
The referent of OBJ(richer), i.e. Tom, is to be inter-
preted as the standa72-67-comparisiirragainst which the
referent of doctors is judged. The entire predication
forms a term expression (&apos;T&apos;) acting as OBJ(know), so
that the whole relational analysis is as sh6W-in (2).

<bodyText confidence="0.998070666666667">
Because Pr/richer is included in an argument of another
predicate cullywr: the former is in a relation subordinate
to the latter.
This analysis assumes three types of comparative predi-
cates: adverbial, adjectival, and quantifier. Illustra-
tions are given below:

<bodyText confidence="0.99980775">
The adverbial predicates are subcateaorized as taking
predicational arguments in both relations, and only such
arguments; the other types can take nonpredicational
arguments, though in some cases their Objects may be
predicational.
SEC. 3 COREPRESENTATIONAL GRAMMAR (CORG)
The grammar itself consists of two sets of principles.
The first set consists of general constraints on sentence
structure and applies as well to non-comparative con-
structions. These principles are discussed in detail in
[1] and [2] and will be presented here without justifi-
cation. In addition there are a number of principles
applying only to comparative constructions but non ad
hoc in the sense that each can be applied toward the so-
lution of a number of distinct problems of analysis.
These principles are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.928231083333333">
(6) Law of Correspondence Every NP or term in a
sentence must be assigned a relational role. [1]
(7) Law of Uniqueness No two elements in a sentence
may bear the same relation to a sinnle predicate
unless they are coordinate or coreferential. [1]
(3) Object Rule (OR) If P is an active transitive
predicate, OBJ(P) must be identified in such a
way as to guarantee that as many segments thereof
as possible occur to the right of P. [1]
(9) Multi-Predicate Constraint Every predicate in a
sentence which contains more than one predicate
must be in an ordination relation with some other
predicate in that sentence.[4]
(10) Term Identification Principles
a. Any predication with the internal structure
OU-SUB-PRED may be analyzed as T. Any nP is
a T. Any T satisfying either of these conditions
is a SIMPLE TERM.
b. Any predication consisting solely of a compara-
tive predicate with simple MP&apos;s as arguments is
a T; such expressions will be called SIMPLE
COMPARATIVE TERMS. All others will be COMPLEX
COMPARATIVE TERMS.
c. Any predication whose Subject occurs to the

<bodyText confidence="0.9520032">
right of than, and whose predicate either
occurs to-ER left of than or occurs as SUBJ(do)
where do itself occurs to the right of than, is
a T; such expressions will be called PRUTTATE-
CONTAINpG TERMS or PCT&apos;s.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.856988615384615">
(11) Comparative Object Rule The object of a comparative
predicate is any term or predication satisfying the
subcategorization of the predicate and which in-
cludes some element occuring immediately to the
right of than.
(12) ComparatiVi-Tubject Rule The Subject of a compara-
tive predicate must occur to the left of than.
(13) Comparative Object Restriction The ObjecTOT a
nonadverbial comparative predicate must be a simple
term unless the MP occuring immediately to the
right of than is SUBJ of a PCT; in that case, the
OBJ of the non-adverbial comparative predicate must
be a PC-term.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998809375">
These principles do not define a parsing algorithm per
se; rather, they express certain surface true restric-
tions which taken together and in concert with the gen-
eral principles from Kac [1 ] and [2 ], define exactly
the set of predicate argument structures assignable to
a comparative construction. Since no particular analyt-
ic procedure is associated with CORG, the assignment of
particular analyses may be thought of either as a com-
parison of complete potential relational analyses with
the principles, whereby all potential analyses of the
string not consistent with the grammar are discarded, or
as a process of sequential assignments of partial analy-
ses where each step is checked against the principles.
The sequential method of analysis will be used here to
present the operation of these principles; however, it
Is not a necessary adjunct to the grammar.

SEC. 4.0 STRUCTURE TYPES AND DESCRIPTIVE PROBLEMS
There are three types of comparative predicates, already
noted in section 2: adjectival, quantifier and adverbial.
The differing subcategorization of these predicates does
affect the possible analyses for a given sentence. Sev-
eral other factors which influence the interpretation of
the sentence are the position of the comparative predi-
cate in the sentence, the degree of ellipsis in the
than-phrase, and the subcategorization of surrounding
predicates. The effect of the type of predicate and the
effect of the position of the predicate (in particular
relative to than) will be considered separately in the
following se-Filins. The effects of the degree of
ellipsis in the than phrase and the subcategorization of
surrounding prediTaIes will be considered together in
section 4.3. It should be kept in mind however that all
of these variables may act together in any combination
to affect the type and number of interpretations a given
sentence may have.
SEC. 4.1 SUBCATEGORIZATION AND PREDICATE TYPES
The effects of the type of comparative predicate on the
interpretation can be noted in (3) and (4). The adverb-
ial predicate faster in (3) takes predicational arguments
only (ignoring for now the problem of lexical ambiguity)
while the adjectival predicate taller takes non-predica-
tional (MP or Term) arnuments.
To see how these differences interact with the possible
analyses which may be assigned, consider a complete
analysis of (4). This analysis may begin with any ele-
ment in the sentence. In most cases the assignment of
the object of the comparative predicate, as the first
step, will result in a more direct path to a complete
analysis. Assume then, that Bob has been analyzed as
OBJ(taller). This assignment satisfies the Comparative
Object Ruleand is also consistent with the OR.
</bodyText>

(14) John met people taller than Bob.
08.1
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996728647058824">
Since neither met nor taller is a reflexive predicate,
the Law of Uniqueness guarantees that Bob cannot be
analyzed as OBJ (P), where P is any predicate (other
than taller) as long as it is analyzed as OBJ(taller).
Since thereare two non-reflexive predicates in this
sentence (taller and met), there are four remaininq re-
lational aii1715Fients ;Wien must be made before the analy-
sis is complete. These are SUBJ(met), OBJ(met), sum
(taller) and some ordination relaFah between the pred-
icates met and taller.
Either John or people may be analyzed as SUBJ(taller) at
this poi-Fa-since both satisfy the Comparative 3171E5Tt
Rule by occuring to the left of than. If John were
assigned the relation SUBJ(talleiTThe analysis would
violate some principles. Assume for purposes of demon-
stration, that John=SUBJ(taller). The relational analy-
sis at this point would then be:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.754889">

</listItem>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.426393" genericHeader="abstract">
supJ lr OBJ
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995067222222222">
The remaining relational assignments would be OBJ(met),
SUBJ(met) and some ordination relation for the two pred-
icates. The next apparently logical step would be to
analyze people as 03J(met). However, this will violate
the OR, since it is poiiible to include more than just
the UP people as part of the OBJ(met). The OR requires
that as many segments as possible occuring to the right
of a predicate be included in OBJ(P). The way to satis-
fy this condition would be to analyze people as part of
PR/taller. Then the OR would be satisfied by the maxi-
mum number of elements (consistent with the grammar)
which occur to the right of met. The only possible re-
lation that people could bear to taller would be SUBJ
(taller) since it occurs to the left ofthan (see Com-
parative Subject Rule). If it is analyzed as SUBJ(tal- •
ler), then John can no longer be analyzed as SUBJ(tal=
ler). These steps would give the following partial rela-
tional representation:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.873664">

1. SUBJ T
PR/taller(T)
nsj 03,)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995702848484848">
At this point in the analysis, the only relation which
needs to be assigned still is SUBJ(met). The assignment
of this relation to John is the only possible choice
which violates no pri5Ciple of the grammar and this as-
signment would give a complete analysis.
The analysis of (3) procedes along somewhat different
lines due to the subcategorization of the adverbial
comparative predicate faster, which requires predica-
tional arguments. The analysiscan begin as before by
attempting to assign arguments to the comparative predi-
cate faster. However, the first MP after than cannot be
assigned to faster as OBJ since it is not a predicational
arnument. The TJEcategorization of faster requires com-
plete predications to be available before arguments for
it may be identified. Thus consider the other predi-
cates, build and Lux. Both are transitive predicates
taking 557Y-simple NP&apos;s as arguments. The MP them must
be analyzed as OBJ(fly) because of the OR. Thi-aMpar-
ative OBJ Rule and tEl OR together will require robots
to be analyzed as part of the PR/fly. Since robots
occurs immediately to the richt of than, it must be in-
cluded as part of the OBJ(faster) bTERe Comparative OBJ
Rule. The OR requires the ORJ of any predicate to in-
clude as many elements to the right of that predicate as
possible. Therefore, if possible, fix and them must
also be included as elements of OBJ-ifiSter)7--Tince
faster is an adverbial predicate, it a com-
Fal-predication (in fact requires) to be its object.
Thus, all three of these aspects of the grammar work to-
gether to force the string robots..fly..them to be anal-
yzed as a predication PR/fly as shown below, with PR/fly
analyzed as OBJ(faster).(as allowed by the Comparative
OBJ Rule).

At this point the arguments of build still need to be

predication for its subject, the predication build must
be built first. If any MP&apos;s other than Alice and planes

be completed. For example7-17-Fobots were analyzed as
OBJ(builds) (as well as SUBJ(fly)7Then either Alice or

<bodyText confidence="0.994538666666667">
PR/build could then be analyzed as SUBJ(faster) and all
the necessary relations between arguments and predicates,
and between predicates themselves (i.e. ordination rela-
tions) would be assigned. However, the analysis would be
ill-formed since one element, in this case planes, would
be left unanalyzed in violation of the Law of Correspon-
dence. The only way this situation can be avoided, while
at the same time not violating the OR or the Comparative
Object Rule as discussed above for the OBJ(faster), would
be to use only Alice and planes as arguments for builds.
The OR would r4TILT171i that planes be analyzed as OBJ
(builds) leaving Alice to be analyzed as SUBJ(builds).
This resulting priation Pr/builds can then be anal-
yzed as SUBJ(faster) completing the analysis with all
rules in the grammar satisfied.

The most obvious differences between the analyses of (3)
and (4) is in the types of arguments which the compara-
tive predicates take and the ordination relations be-
tween the predicates and the order in which the differ-
ent predications were &amp;quot;built up&amp;quot;. For (3), the argu-
ments for the non-comparative predicates must be assigned
first, before the arguments for the comparative predi-
cate. This is required by the subcategorization of the
adverbial predicate, which takes predicational arguments
only. In this sentence, the non-comparative predicates
are analyzed as subordinate to the comparative predicate.
This too is a conseqence of the subcategorization of
faster. For (4), the most efficient procedure for
assigning relations (i.e. the one requiring the least
backtracking) requires the arguments of the comparative
predicate taller to be assigned first. In addition
since the subcategorization of this predicate allows
Only for non-predicational arguments, the comparative
predicate is analyzed as subordinate to the non-compar-
ative predicate in the sentence. Thus the type of com-
parative predicate and its subcategorization affects the
type of analysis provided by the grammar, and also the
&amp;quot;optimal&amp;quot; order of relational assignments, when proce-
dural aspects of the analysis are considered.
SEC. 4.2 POSITION OF THE COMPARATIVE PREDICATE
There are two aspects to the problem of the position of
the comparative predicate: one involves the position of
the SUBJ(COMP P) relative to than; the other involves
the position of the entire comparative predication rela-
tive to any other predicate in the string.
SEC. 4.2.1 COORDINATE AND NON-COORDINATE ADVERBIAL
COMPARATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS
In some cases, the arguments of comparative predicates
may be coordinate. This will always be the case for
adverbial comparative predicates for which there is some
ellipsis in the string as in
(20) John builds planes faster than robots
Here robots can be considered to be coordinate with
either Wes or John, that is it can be interpreted as
either the SUBJ(bUTTas) or as the OBJ(builds). In non-
adverbial comparative constructions, it will not always
be the case that a single NP after than will be inter-
preted as coordinate with some nother NP. Consider the
differences in possible interpretations between (4) and
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984991">
(21) John met taller people than Bob
(4) John met people taller than Bob
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.984078236842105">
For (4), there is only one possible interpretation,while
there are two possible interpretations for (21). That is,
in (21) Bob may simply be interpreted as OBJ(taller)
correspollUng to the meaning of the sentence
(22) John met people who are taller than Bob
However, (21) has another interpretation in which Bob is
interpreted as SUBJ(met). This case corresponds to the
interpretation of (23).
(23) John met taller people than Bob did
For this second interpretation, there are two subjects
for met, i.e., John and Bob. This means that John and
Bob must be forEWTTY defiiiiO as coordinate arguments.
Ms formal definition is necessary since the Law of
Uniqueness states that no two NP&apos;s may bear the same
relation to a predicate (i.e. both be SUBJ(Pi) unless
they are coordinate or coreferential. Such a definition
for NP&apos;s such as John and Bob in (23) is not unreason-
able since they both meet the basic requirements for
coordinate elements. They are both interpretable as
bearing the same relation to some Predicate P.
The Comparative Object Restriction and a definition of
coordinate comparative elements are required to precise-
ly define the conditions under which two elements may be
construed as coordinate in a comparative construction.
The essence of the Coordinate Comparative Definition
(not included here due to space considerations) is that
any two elements may be coordinated by than if no
non-adverbial comparative predicate occurs immediately
to the left of than. The ultimate consequence of this
condition is that only one interpretation is allowed for
constructions like (4) and this interpretation does not
include any arguments coordinated by than. This means
that in (4) for example there is no pTiiible analysis in
which Bob can be SUBJ(met).
In the coordinate interpretation of (22), (i.e., where
John is coordinate with Bob) the final analysis of the
string will include the 7-di-1owing predicational struc-
ture:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.860349">

</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.536877">

Pr/met(PCT)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993057666666667">
It is this term, then, which is assigned to the relation
OBJ(taller), people being SUBJ(taller) (note that people
plays two distinct roles in this sentence).

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992827166666667">
This particular assignment (of pr/met as OBJ(taller) is
allowed by the Comparative Object Restriction. That is,
taller, being non-adverbial comparative predicate, is
not subcategorized for predicational arguments. But in
(25) OBJ(taller) contains a predicate as one of its
arguments.
This particular predicational structure is defined as a
Predicate Containing Term or PCT by the Term Definitions.
The Comparative Object Restriction has the effect of al-
lowing the OBJ(COMP P) to be a PCT. Since the particular
substring of (22), met..people..Bob need not be analyzed
as a PCT, an alternative analysis for (22) is also pos-
sible. The alternative analysis would be like that for
(4), where only Bob.SUBJ(taller). That is, the Compar-
ative Object Restriction does not necessarily require an
analysis for (22) like (25); it merely allows it if cer-
tain conditions set out in the Term Definition are met.
The Comparative Object Restriction is quite important,
then, in distinguishing the possible analysis for non-
adverbial comparative constructions. It is equally im-
portant in obtaining the correct analysis for the sen-
tence types to be discussed in the next section.
SEC. 4.2.2 SUBJECT COMPARATIVES
The position of the entire comparative predication, rela-
tive to other predicates in the string is also quite im-
portant in determining the possible types of analysis.
Sentence (26) exhibits a subject comparative where the
comparative predication occurs to the left of another
predicate. It is useful to compare this sentence with
the object comparative in (22) repeated here.

As has already been discussed in 4.2.1, (22) has two pos-
sible interpretations. Sentence (26), however, has only
one possible interpretation. Therefore there should be
only one possible analysis. The analysis which needs to
be avoided is

This case must be disallowed while at the same time al-

</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.974105183333334">
Definitions work together to achieve this. The structure
Pr/met shown in (28) does not meet the requirements set
out for a PC-Term and the subcategorization of taller
(i.e. non-predicational arguments only).will not allow
Pr/met to be analyzed as an argument of taller unless it
is analyzable as a PC-Term. Thus, the subcategorization
of taller and the Comparative Object Restriction will
both prevent the assignment of Pr/met as OBJ(taller). in
(27). Since an analysis which includes (27) is not pos-
sible, the only way the analysis can procede is as fol-
lows. The Comparative Subject Rule will require
people=SUBJ(taller) since it is the only MP to the left
of than. Since Bob is the element occuring immediately
to i-h-Tright of than, it is the only MP which can be
analyzed as object of taller. The resulting predication
Pr/taller is defined as a term by (lob).
(28) Taller peqple than Bqb met John
SUBJ OtJ
Pr/taller(T)
The MP John must be analyzed as OBJ(met) to satisfy the
OR, lei7TFF Pr/taller to be analyzed as SUBJ(met). This
will also satisfy the MultiPredicate Constraint since
taller and met will be in some ordination relation as a
7iidif.
(29) Taller people than Bob met John
GUM TPr/taller(T)
SdOJ OQJ
Pr/met
No other analysis is possible since no non-comparative
predicate occurs to the left of than (which would allow
for possible coordinate interpreiillOns).
SEC. 4.2.3 CONCLUSIONS
The important points in this section are that for Sub-
ject Comparatives such as (26), only one interpretation
is possible, while for Object Comparatives such as (22),
two interpretations are possible. Position of the com-
parative predication relative to the rest of the string
is thus an important factor in determining the number of
possible interpretations. Position of individual NP&apos;s
relative to than is also an important factor in deter-
mining the number of possible interpretations a sentence
may have Sentences like (4),where no MP occurs between
than and the comparative predicate, have only one inter-
pretation, while sentences like (22), where an MP does
occur in the position, have two possible interpretations.
The Comparative Object Restriction and the Term Defini-
tions figure crucially in all these cases in the deter-
mination of the correct number and type of possible
analyses.
SEC. 4.3 DEGREE OF ELLIPSIS AND SUBCATEGORIZATION OF
SURROUNDING PREDICATES
The degree of ellipsis following than in comparative
structures is quite important in determining the number
of possible interpretations a structure may have. For
example, in the first sentence of each pair below, where
only a single predicate occurs before than, more than
one interpretation is possible per string, while in the
second sentence in each pair, where an NP followed by
some predicate occurs, only one interpretation is
Possible.

SEC. 4.3.1 DEGREE OF ELLIPSIS AND SUBCATEGORIZATION OF
SURROUNDING PREDICATES.
The problem of degree of ellipsis interacts crucially
with another factor, the subcateqorization of surround-
ing predicates, in a very interesting way. Consider ,
the following sets of sentences.
John knows more doctors than lawyers debate
John knows more doctors than lawyers debate

These sentences contain different combinations of com-
parative predicates with either transitive or intrans-
itive verbs following them and preceding verbs which
take: either complement or MP objects (341-(37); MP
objects only (38-41); and complement objects only (42-
45). The type and number of interpretations depends on
the subcategorization of these verbs and the verbs fol-
lowing the comparative predicate. The first sentence in
each group contains a transitive verb, debate, with no
overt object. The second sentence in each groupcontains
debate with an overt object. This results in (39) in an
ungrammatical sentence, as compared with (38), and in
(35) in a sentence with only one possible interpretation
as compared with (34), which has two possible interpre-
tations. The third sentence in each group contains an
Intransitive verb, run. This also results in an ungram-
matical sentence foirT40) in the second group and in a
sentence with only one interpretation, (36) in the first
verb, gg::11(1,i:fet=tgragu:v::3•nillji:catr.lott
?ragitiTv:e
difference between this verb and debate is that debate
Is a so-called &apos;object deletablel-Tria—While spoiRri5T-
is not. Note that in (45) this results in an ungrammat-
ical sentence (compare to 42) while in (37) the sentence
is grammatical. However, in (37) the structure of the
phrase more doctors than lawyers differs from its struc-
ture in (351 and (36), in which more doctors than
1121Attrl is the subject of the third verb. That is not
the aie in (37), where only lawyers is the subject of
the third verb. It can be seiii-67.61 this that the sub-
categorization of the preceding the following predicates
Is very important to the structure of the comparative
predication. In addition, as the first two sentences

the structure.
In all cases, the structure of the phrase more doctors
than lawyers shifts in structure. The most important
aspect of this data is the type of arguments which the
comparative predicates must take. In these particular
cases it is a change in the object of the comparative
predicate which corresponds to a shift in the structure
of the sentence. This is accounted for most directly by
the rules in (10), (11) and (13).
For example, in (36) the OBJ(more) is lawyers and the
complete predication Pr/more The Subject of run.
This partial analysis is—a-Eign in (46).

Sentence (36) could not be analyzed as in (47) because
run, the third verb in (36), is intransitive while
Teiate, the third verb in (38), is transitive. Thus run
cannot be included in any structure satisfying the Term
Identification Principles (10), while debate can be so
analyzed. This means that run cannot FF-TiEluded as part
of the OBJ(more). This is guaranteed by the Comparative
Object Restilaion (13).

<bodyText confidence="0.957805916666667">
Both of the analyses shown in (46) and (47) are possible
for sentence (34) since knows may take predicational
objects (in this case, more doctors than lawyers run) or
it may take nonpredicational objects such as the complex
comparative term in (47).
Sentences (39) and (40) do not have possible analyses
since hired cannot take predicational objects (such as
that shown in (46)), and the presence of either an
intransitive verb (run) or a transitive verb with an
overt object (debate psychiatrists) after the compara-
tive predicate, forces such a structure because of rules
(10) and (13). Sentence (41) would have a structure
similar to (47).
Sentences (42) - (44) would all have structures similar
to the partial analysis in (46). This is forced by the
subcategorization of thinks, which takes only predica-
tional objects. There-117o possible analysis for (45)
since the subcategorization of spoke to, unlike debate,
requires the presence of an overt object. But if an
object is assigned to spoke to, the result will ulti-
mately be a structure like t-git shown in (47). But the
structure shown in (47) is a term and therefore nonpred-
icational. This means it could not be analyzed as
OBJ(thinks), while requires a predicational (complement)
structure.
Finally, it is precisely because a sentence with spoke
to as the third verb must have a structure like (4/T-
nonpredicational) that sentence (41) has a possible
analysis in contrast to (45). That is, the structure of
the string more doctors than lawyers spoke to in (49)
has a nonpredicational (comparative term) structure.
Since it is a term and not a predication, any verb tak-
ing it as an argument must be subcategorized for nonpred-
icational arguments. Think in (45) takes only predica-
tional arguments in thi-aject relation, while hired in
(41) takes only nonpredicational arguments in the object
relation. Thus, only the sentence with hired may take
the comparative term as an argument. But sooke to does
not allow the string more doctors than lawyers to simply
be analyzed as its subject, since no possible object
would then be available for spoke to. However, if the
string more doctors than lawyers is not analyzed as
SUBJ(spoke to), it will not be possible to analyze the
string as a predication Pr/spoke to, thus blocking the
analysis of the string as OBJ(think).
SEC. 4.3.2 CONCLUSION
The degree of ellipsis and the subcategorization of the
surrounding predicates interact to affect the possible
number and type of interpretations for each of the sen-
tences in this section. That interaction can be most
clearly seen in a comparison of (34) and (35) and (36).
The verb know is subcategorized for either predicational
or nonpreTrational arguments. This allows the string
more doctors than lawyers debate to have two possible
structures corresponding to the structures shown in (46)
and (47). The structure in (46) is a predicational
structure while the structure in (47) is a nonpredica-
tional structure. The subcategorization of knows allows
either of those as possible interpretations of the OBJ
(knows). Verbs subcategorized for only one type of ar-
gument, say predicational, will allow only one of those
possible structures of more doctors than lawyers debate,
in this case the predicational one shown in (46), to be
analyzed as the object of that verb. This is one way in
which the subcategorization of surrounding predicates
affects the type and number of possible interpretations
a sentence may have.
The effect of the subcategorization of the following
predicate parallels the effect of no ellipsis after than.
Thus sentences (35) and (36) each have only one possible
interpretation and the relation of the string more doc-
tors than lawyers is the same in each case; that is, it
is the same as the oredicational structure shown in (46),
being the subject of the following predicate. Thus, the
presence of an intransitive verb or the presence of a
transitive verb plus an overt object to its right as in
(35) and (36) forces a predicational structure of the
type shown in (46). Since knows takes predicational
objects, these sentences are still grammatical. If
hired is substituted for knows as in (39) and (40), the
sentences are no longer grammatical, since the subcate-
gorization of hired does not allow predication arguments.
The last type of effect of the predicate following than
is in some cases to force a nonpredicational structure
like that shown in (47). The verb spoke to is not an
object deletable verb, while the verb debate does allow
unspecified objects. For this reason, the verb sooke to
cannot be part of a structure like that shown in 463T
since it would require the object of spoke to to be
analyzed as &amp;quot;unspecified&amp;quot;. Thus, the presence of a verb
like spoke to after than forces the nonpredicational
structure of the type shown in (47), since in this struc-
ture the object of spoke to would be overt. Since the
presence of spoke to forces a nonpredicational structure
for the string more doctors than lawyers spoke to, it
can only occur as part of an object of a verb which al-
lows nonpredicational objects, like know or hired.
It follows from this that if the striTi-more doctors
than lawyers spoke to occured after a verb which took
predicational arguments only, such as thinks, the result
would be an ungrammatical sentence. This is in fact the
case, as can be seen from sentence (45).
SEC. 5 CONCLUSIONS
The rules presented here provide an axiom system which
allows only one possible analysis for each interpreta-
tion of a sentence, and no possible analysis for sen-
tences which are ungrammatical. The rules specifically
proposed for comparatives have been shown to apply to a
wide variety of construction types; for example, the
Comparative Object Restriction and the Term Definitions
figure crucially in the analysis of sentences in all the
subsections of section 4. In addition, these rules are
based on observations about characteristics of the sen-
tences which are either directly observable in the
string (e.g. left to right relative order) or which are
a necessary part of any grammatical description (e.g.
subclassification and subcategorization of verbs). Such
a grammar can provide useful and accessible information
for the problem of parsing as well as grammatical
description.

The effects of the degree of ellipsis in the than phrase and the subcategorization of surrounding prediTaIes will be considered together in section 4.3. It should be kept in mind however that all of these variables may act together in any combination to affect the type and number of interpretations a given sentence may have. SEC. 4.1 SUBCATEGORIZATION AND PREDICATE TYPES The effects of the type of comparative predicate on the interpretation can be noted in (3) and (4). The adverbial predicate faster in (3) takes predicational arguments only (ignoring for now the problem of lexical ambiguity) while the adjectival predicate taller takes non-predicational (MP or Term) arnuments. To see how these differences interact with the possible analyses which may be assigned, consider a complete analysis of (4). This analysis may begin with any element in the sentence. In most cases the assignment of the object of the comparative predicate, as the first step, will result in a more direct path to a complete analysis.

These steps would give the following partial relational representation: (16) John met people taller than Bob 1. SUBJ T PR/taller(T) nsj 03,) At this point in the analysis, the only relation which needs to be assigned still is SUBJ(met). The assignment of this relation to John is the only possible choice which violates no pri5Ciple of the grammar and this assignment would give a complete analysis. The analysis of (3) procedes along somewhat different lines due to the subcategorization of the adverbial comparative predicate faster, which requires predicational arguments. The analysiscan begin as before by attempting to assign arguments to the comparative predicate faster. However, the first MP after than cannot be assigned to faster as OBJ since it is not a predicational arnument. The TJEcategorization of faster requires complete predications to be available before arguments for it may be identified. Thus consider the other predicates, build and Lux.

For (3), the arguments for the non-comparative predicates must be assigned first, before the arguments for the comparative predicate.

This paper argues that comparatives can be structurally analyzed on the basis of syntactic Information alone via a strictly surface-based grammar. Such a grammar is given in Ryan [5], based on the corepresentational model of Kac [1]. While the grammar does not define a parsing algorithm per se, it nonetheless expresses regularities of surface organization and Its relationship to semantic interpretation that an adequate parser would be expected to incorporate. This paper will discuss four problem areas in the description of comparatives and will outline the sections of the grammar of [5] that apply to them. The central problem in parsing comparatives involves identifying the arguments of comparative predicates, and the relations borne by these arguments to such predicates. A corepresentational grammar is explicitly designed to assign predicate-argument structure to sentences on the basis of their surface syntactic organization. SEC. 2 COMPARATIVE PREDICATES An initial assumption underlying the proposed analysis of.comparatives is that the comparative elements such as more, faster, more spacious, are syntactically akin to [Vacates, and thus that the principles applying to pred</context>
<context position="23131" citStr="[5]" startWordPosition="3739" endWordPosition="3739"> structure may have. For example, in the first sentence of each pair below, where only a single predicate occurs before than, more than one interpretation is possible per string, while in the second sentence in each pair, where an NP followed by some predicate occurs, only one interpretation is Possible. (30) Alice builds planes faster than robots (31) Alice builds planes faster than robots do (32) John knows richer doctors than Alice (33) John knows richer doctors than Alice does The actual analysis of these sentences will not be presented here. Such sentences are discussed in detail in Ryan [5]. SEC. 4.3.1 DEGREE OF ELLIPSIS AND SUBCATEGORIZATION OF SURROUNDING PREDICATES. The problem of degree of ellipsis interacts crucially with another factor, the subcateqorization of surrounding predicates, in a very interesting way. Consider , the following sets of sentences.
