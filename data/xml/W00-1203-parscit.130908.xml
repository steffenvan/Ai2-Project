ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.9999622">
In this paper, a knowledge extraction process
was proposed to extract the knowledge for
identifying Chinese organization names. The
knowledge extraction process utilizes the
structure property, statistical property as well as
partial linguistic knowledge of the organization
names to extract new organizations from domain
texts. The knowledge extraction processes were
experimented on large amount of texts retrieved
from WWW With high standard of threshold
values, new organization names can be
identified with very high precision. Therefore
the knowledge extraction processes can be
carried out automatically to self improve the
performance in the future.

1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932454545455">
The occurrences of unknown words cause
difficulties in natural language processing. The
word set of a natural language is open-ended.
There is no way of collecting every words of a
language, since new words will be created for
expressing new concepts, new inventions,
newborn babies, new organizations. Therefore
how to identify new words in a text will be the
most challenging task for natural language
processing. It is especially true for Chinese.
Each Chinese morpheme (usually a single
character) carries meanings and most are
polysemous. New words are easily constructed
by combining morphemes and their meanings
are the semantic composition of morpheme
components. However there are also
semantically non-compositional compounds,
such as proper names. In Chinese text, there is
no blank to mark word boundaries and no
inflectional markers nor capitalization markers
to denote the syntactic or semantic types of new
words. Hence the unknown word identification
for Chinese became one of the most difficult and
demanding research topic.
There are many different types of
unknown words and each has different morph-
syntactic and morph-semantic structures. In
principle their syntactic and semantic categories
can be determined by their content and
contextual information, but there are many
difficult problems have to be solved. First of
all it is not possible to find a uniform
representational schema and categorization
algorithm to handle different types of
unknown words due to their different morph-
syntactic structures. Second, the clues for
identifying different type of unknown words
are also different. For instance, identification
of names of Chinese people is very much
relied on the surnames, which is a limited set
of characters. The statistical methods are
commonly used for identifying proper names
(Chen &amp; Lee 1996, Chang et al. 1994, Sun et
al. 1994). The identification of general
compounds is more relied on the morphemes
and the semantic relations between
morphemes (Chen &amp; Chen 2000). The third
difficulty is the problems of ambiguities,
such as structure ambiguities, syntactic
ambiguities and semantic ambiguities. For
instances, usually a morpheme
character/word has multiple meaning and
syntactic categories and may play the roles
of common words or proper names.
Therefore the ambiguity resolution became
one of the major tasks.
In this paper we focus our attention on
the identification of the organization names.
It is considered to be a hard task to identify
organization names in comparing with the
identification of other types of unknown
words, because there are not much morph-
syntactic and morph-semantic clues to
indicate an organization name. There is no
significant preference on the selection of
morphemes/ characters and the semantic of
the morphemes, which gives no clue leading
toward the identification. For instance,
micro-soft&apos; (Microsoft) has the character by
character (morpheme by morpheme)
translation of &apos;slightly soft&apos; and there is no
marker, such as capitalization, to indicate
that it is a proper name. The only reliable
clue is its context information. However an
organization&apos;s full names usually occur at its
first mention, unless it is a well-known
organization. A full name contains its proper

<bodyText confidence="0.996269782608696">
name and organization type, such as ME
, Acer Computer-Company&apos;. The
organization types became the major clue of
identifying a new organization name. However
abbreviated shorter names usually will be used,
such as a) omit part of the organization type, for
instances ‘z...5 CM, Acer Computer&apos;, &apos;Ea
, Acer Company&apos;, b) omit the organization
type totally, for instance ,gig, Acer&apos;, or c) the
abbreviation, for instanceV.-2, global-electric
(Acer-computer)&apos;. Therefore the task became
not only the identification of organization names
in different forms but also finding their meaning
equivalence classes. To achieve the above goal,
the knowledge of 1) proper names of
organizations, 2) different lines of the businesses,
and 3) different organization types, should be
equipped. Unfortunately there is no well-
prepared knowledge sources containing the
above information. Therefore a knowledge
extraction model is proposed to extract the
above mentioned knowledge from the dictionary
and domain texts.

2. STRUCTURES OF ORGANIZATION
NAMES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892696428572">
There is no rigid structure for an organization
name as mentioned in the previous section.
Roughly speaking an organization name is
composed by two major components. The first
part is the proper name and the second part is the
organization type. The second part contains the
major key words lead toward the identification
of an organization, since the organization types,
such as , company&apos;, ‘g-12- foundation&apos;,
IJNE group&apos;, &apos;XIN enterprise&apos; etc, tells what
kind of organizations they are. If it is a company,
to be more informative the line of business
usually goes with the key word `!air-il company&apos;,
for instances &apos;*áJ food company&apos;, &apos;CM
computer company&apos;, * mill
investment consultant company&apos;, but in most
cases the keyword `2\.; Tlf company&apos; will be
ignored, such as Ag—tai( President food).
Sometimes the line of business and the
organization type go together to become a single
word, such as &apos;4:IW middle school&apos; , &apos;f
bank&apos; , hospital&apos;. By observing the
structure of the organization name, it seems that
once a complete list of the organization types is
well prepared, then it is not hard to identify the
organizations by their full names. The only
complication is that abbreviated names occur
more frequently than full names. The identifier
company&apos; is usually ignored in real text.
The lines of business became the major
identifier for a company and many business lines
are common words, such as .*ea food&apos;,
&apos;ajE computer&apos;, `710g cement&apos;. Therefore
it is necessary to make the distinction
between a common compounds and a
company name, for examples, ..icatia,
health food&apos; vs. ,a-*67„ President food&apos;,
&apos;AJ personal computer&apos; vs. ,E*4
Acer computer&apos;. Although they are two-
way ambiguous, usually they have only one
preference reading.
In conclusion, the types and the proper
names of organizations will be the major
clues lead toward the identification of the
organizations. In addition, it is also better to
have a list of well known organization
names, such that the well known company
names, like k7&apos; V Microsoft&apos;, can be
identified immediately. Most of the
knowledge preparation works should be
done by offline approaches. The prepared
knowledge would be utilized to online
identification of newly coined organizations.
The equivalent classes of the well-known
organizations are also classified by a
similarity-based approach.

3. KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972633333333">
There are two knowledge sources. One is the
CICIP Chinese lexicon and another is the
Chinese text from WWW. The lexicon
provides a partial list of important
organizations and the information extracted
from them will be the initial knowledge of
the identification system. The texts from
WWW provide ample of new organization
names implicitly. The problem is how to
extract some, if not all, of them from the
texts. Once we have a list of organization
names. The proper names for organizations
and the organization types will be extracted
by analyzing the morphological structures of
the organization names. However an
effective morphological analyzer depends
upon the availability of the knowledge of the
organization types, but the lists of the
organization types are not available yet.
As we mentioned before the complete
organization names have two parts. The first
part is the proper name and the second part
is the organization type. The number of
different proper names is unlimited and on
the other hand the number of different
organization types is limited. This property
will be utilized to separate the variable parts,
i.e. the proper name, and the constant parts,
i.e. the organization type, from the
organization names.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.983193">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935705882353">
The numbers of organization names in the
lexicon is very limited, since only the important
organizations in the common domain will be
collected. Therefore the initial knowledge
extracted from lexicon is also very limited. To
make the sources of knowledge more adequate,
vast amount of new organization names should
be extracted from each different domain corpus.
Unfortunately none of the existing corpora had
tagged the organization names. Therefore we are
going to design a semi-automatic method to
extract the high frequency organization names
from text corpora.
The locality of occurrences of keywords in a
text will be utilized for keyword extraction.
Once an organization name occurring in a text it
is very probably reoccurred in the same text. The
recurrence property had been utilized to extract
keywords or key-phrases from text (Chien 1999,
Fung 1998, Smadja 1993). However not all
keywords are organization names. The
knowledge extracted from the lexicon, i.e. the
list of the organization types will be the initial
knowledge for identifying organization names.
In addition to the initial knowledge, the structure
property of the organization names will be also
utilized in classifying extracted keywords into
organization names and non-organization names.
The extraction processes will be repeated for
extracting new organizations and therefore
extracting new organization types. The more
knowledge would have been extracted the more
accurate of the organization identification will
achieve.

As we observed, the morphological structure of
an organization name usually is a compounding
of a proper name and a organization type. The
organization type might be a compounding of a
line of business and a type, for instances es
/.1.1..q (computer company), En (bank), 143 gl4
(middle school), or simply a line of business,
for instances *ffll(food), l(computer),
E (cement). The proper names are
variables, since each organization type may
have many different institutions with
different names. The types are constants.
There is a limited number of constants
attached with many different proper names
to form different organization names.
Therefore to extract the organization types is
equivalent to extract the high frequency
ending morphemes. Table 2 shows the top 20
high frequency ending morphemes extracted
from the 1391 organization names and in
deed they are organization types.

3.2 Automatic Extraction of Organization
Names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974800666666667">
A Web spider can extract text from each
different domain through WWW. Then
keyword extraction technique is applied on
domain texts to retrieve possible keywords.
The keyword set includes organization
names, personal names, general compounds,
and also error extraction. Most of which are
not organization names. It is supposed that
the available list of the organization types
will be the source of knowledge to identify
candidates of organizations. However such a
method only identifies the organizations of
the known organization types and provides
new proper names only. It will not identify
new types of organizations. Therefore we
use a new method to extract the organization
names by using the structure property of
organization names.
Extraction Algorithm for Organization
Types:
Step 1. Using a Web spider to collect
Chinese texts of a fixed domain, such as
domain of finance and business, from
WWW.
Step 2. Extract high frequency keywords in
the text (Smadja 93, Chang &amp; Su 97, Chien
99).
Step 3. For the keywords of length 3,4, and 5,
each keyword is divided into two parts X
and Y. X is a candidate of proper name and
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995582">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999852333333333">
Y is a candidate of organization type. The X is
the initial two-characters of the keyword and Y
is the remained characters. (Since most proper
names of organizations have two characters, we
can extract the organization types of the lengths
1, 2 and 3 from three different groups of
keywords with lengths 3, 4 and 5 respectively.)
Extract the organization type Y, if for some
keywords X+Y, the following conditions hold.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.489824">
a) X satisfies one of the following cases.
</equation>
<listItem confidence="0.9889854">
1. X is not in the lexicon, i.e. X is an
unknown word.
2. X has the categories of Nb or Nc, i.e. it is
a known proper name (Nb) or a location
name (Nc).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.979233428571429">
b) For each Y, assumed to be the organization
type, there must have more than n number of
different X, such that X+Y in the extracted
keyword list. In practice, the threshold value
n was set to 2.
In general, Chinese company names like most
proper names are non-common word (unknown
words). However sometimes they are place
names (Nc), but rarely they are common nouns,
adjectives, or verbs. Therefore in order to avoid
too many false alarms, such as &amp;quot;WAWA super
computer&amp;quot;, to be considered as a company name,
the condition a) of step 3 is set. The reason to
setup the condition b) is that each organization
type Y should have many different organizations
which have the same organization type Y, such
as ik Acer computer &apos; ,
Leo computer &apos; , a IS Blue-sky
computer&apos;, ...etc.. The real implementation
shows the different threshold value n gives the
different precision and recall for identification.
For the first iteration of knowledge
extraction, we suggest to have higher recall rate.
Set the threshold value low and manually select
the final list of the organization types. For the
future automatic knowledge extraction, in order
to increase the precision of the information
extraction higher threshold values are suggested.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963042857143">
The knowledge extraction processes for Chinese
organization names are carried out by different
stages. At the first stage, the words marked with
semantic category of organization were accessed
from the CKIF&apos; dictionary. There are 1391 word
organization types. As mentioned in section 3.1,
a pseudo morphological analysis process was
carried out, which try to find the high frequency
ending morphemes. Since the structure of an
organization name is a composition of X+Y,
where X is a proper name and Y is a
organization type. There are 546 different
ending morphemes. The high frequency
ending morphemes are exactly to be the
morphemes for common organization types.
Many of them are monosyllabic words and
they are polysemous, as shown in Table 1.
For the future identification, the
disambiguation process has to be carried out
for those polysemous ending morphemes
(Chen &amp; Chen 2000). The extracted
morphemes and list of organizations will be
the first collection of the organization types.
At the second stage, we try to extract
new organizations names from different
domain text. Each different domain has
many new organization types. For instance
in the domain of finance and business, there
are many company names, which have
completely different word strings for the
organization types as in the extracted list by
the first stage.
The algorithm shown in the section 3.2
was carried out. At the step 1, 31787 texts of
news of the finance and business domain
were extracted from http://www.cnyes.com.
At step 2, 40675 keywords were extracted
from the news corpus. At step 3,
organization names were identified and the
organization types were extracted. If the
threshold value n = 2, 92 types were
extracted and among them 83 are correct
organization types. The precision is 90%. If
the threshold was set to 3, only 56 types
were extracted and all of them happen to be
correct. The precision increased to 100%,
but of course the recall rate dropped. We
don&apos;t know the exact recall rate, since there
are too many keywords in the training set.
However the recall rate is not important,
since the whole knowledge extraction
process is a recurrent process. The
knowledge extraction procedures should be
repeatedly applied on the different set of text
and at each iteration more information will
be extracted. Hence the precision is much
more important than the recall. The
knowledge sources for future identification
of organizations are the accumulated lists of
the organization names, the proper names of
organizations and the organization types.
Table 3 contains the extracted
organization types while the threshold value
n=3. The organization types are classified by
their lengths and sorted by their frequencies
of uses. Table 4 contains the extracted
organization types which associated with
exactly two different names and the last line
shows the error extractions. Among newly
extracted organization types only 23 of them

4.1 Strategies for On-line Identification of
Organization Names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988394736842">
The knowledge about organizations extracted
from the dictionaries and domain texts will be
used to identify organization names at on-line
sentence processing. During the word
segmentation process, an organization name is
either identified immediately (if it is a known
organization name), or it will be segmented into
two segments of X+Y or several segments of
(x 1 +x2+...+xn)+Y, where X is a proper names,
Y is the organization type. When the proper
name X is a new word, it will be segmented into
shorter segments (xl +x2+...+xn). To simplify
the experiment process, we assume the proper
names X are either the words of categories Nb
(i.e. proper names) or Nc (i.e. the place names)
or a two-character unknown word. For the
identification experiment, a corpus extract from
a T.V. news ( http://www.ttv.com.tw )
The patterns of X+Y in the testing corpus
were searched. 117 different organizations were
identified. Among them 56 are known
organizations, i.e. they are in the organization
name list. 61 of them are identified by the
composition of X+Y and 52 of them are correct.
It counts the precision of 52/61=85% for
identifying new names. The total performance is
the precision of 108/117=92%.
The knowledge-based approach for
identifying organization names seems very
promising. It outperforms the reports of the
precision of 61.79% and the recall of
54.50% in (Chen &amp; Lee 1996) and the
experiment was carried out under the
condition that the knowledge extraction
process is in its initial stage. We expect that
performance of the algorithm will become
better and better while the knowledge
extraction process continuously performs.

I. For each abbreviation name matches the

5. CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879">
The knowledge extraction process will be
continuously carried on in the future. The
accumulated knowledge will be utilized for the
on-line unknown word identification as well as
for the off-line knowledge extraction. The
proposed knowledge extraction processing
model can be generalized to extract other types
of linguistics or morphological knowledge, for
instances, to extract the transliterate foreign
names, to extract the titles of people.
Some of the errors are caused by that the
titles of the people are wrongly identified as
organization types, since the patterns of people&apos;s
name followed by their title are commonly
occurred in real text. These patterns are similar
to the structures of organization names. Such
kind of errors can be avoid, if the titles of people
are known and in fact the titles of people can be
extracted by the same extraction model except
that most of people&apos;s names have three
characters instead of two.
In the future, the knowledge extraction
processes will be automatically carried out. We
expect that it will be one of the major building
blocks for automatic learning systems for
Chinese morphology and sentence processing.

<abstract confidence="0.998989875">In this paper, a knowledge extraction process was proposed to extract the knowledge for identifying Chinese organization names. The knowledge extraction process utilizes the structure property, statistical property as well as partial linguistic knowledge of the organization names to extract new organizations from domain texts. The knowledge extraction processes were experimented on large amount of texts retrieved from WWW With high standard of threshold values, new organization names can be identified with very high precision. Therefore the knowledge extraction processes can be carried out automatically to self improve the performance in the future.</abstract>
