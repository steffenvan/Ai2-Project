Graph theory is a well studied discipline, and so is the field of natural language processing.
Traditionally, these two areas of study have been perceived as distinct, with different algorithms,
different applications, and different potential end-users. However, as recent research work has
shown, the two disciplines are in fact intimately connected, with a large variety of natural language
processing applications finding efficient solutions within graph-theoretical frameworks.
This volume contains papers accepted for presentation at the Textgraphs 2006 Workshop on
Graph-based Algorithms for Natural Language Processing. This event took place on June 9,
2006, in New York City, immediately following the HLT-NAACL Human Language Technologies
Conference. The workshop was centered around the topic of using graph-based algorithms
for natural language processing, and it brought together people working on areas as diverse as
lexical semantics, text summarization, text mining, ontology construction, clustering and learning,
connected by the common underlying theme consisting of the use of graph-theoretical methods for
text processing tasks.
We issued calls for both regular and short, late–breaking papers. After careful review by our
program committee, eleven regular papers and four short papers were accepted for presentation. We
were truly impressed by the high quality of the reviews provided by all the members of the program
committee, particularly since deadlines were very tight. All of the committee members provided
timely and thoughtful reviews, and the papers that appear have certainly benefited from that expert
feedback.
Finally, when we first started planning this workshop, we agreed that having a high quality
invited speaker was crucial. We thank Lillian Lee not only for her talk, but also for the boost of
confidence provided by her quick and enthusiastic acceptance.
