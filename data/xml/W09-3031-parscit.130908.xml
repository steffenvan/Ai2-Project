In this paper, we present preliminary work on
corpus-based anaphora resolution of discourse
deixis in German. Our annotation guidelines
provide linguistic tests for locating the antecedent,
and for determining the semantic types of both the
antecedent and the anaphor. The corpus consists of
selected speaker turns from the Europarl corpus.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988875">
An important component of text understanding is
anaphora resolution, i.e. to determine the refer-
ence of constituents whose interpretation depends
on (the reference of) other textual elements. The
majority of anaphora are instances of noun phrase
anaphora, which relate a noun phrase anaphor to
a nominal antecedent. Grammatical restrictions
(gender, number agreement) and saliency (gram-
matical function, recency) guide the resolution
process in these cases. In addition to pronouns,
definite noun phrases can be viewed as anaphoric
in that they may corefer to some other NP in the
given context. To solve the latter type of anaphora,
lexical semantic knowledge is required, as pro-
vided by an ontology or a database like WordNet.
Another type of anaphora is discourse deixis
(Webber 1988; 1991), which relates a noun phrase
anaphor to a verbal or (multi-)clausal antecedent.
The discourse entities that are introduced by
antecedents of discourse deictic pronouns are
called “abstract objects” since they refer to prop-
erties and propositional entities (Asher, 1993).
Grammatical restrictions cannot apply since the
antecedent is non-nominal and the anaphor—
commonly in the form of a personal or demonstra-
tive pronoun—is usually in neuter singular. We
assume that in addition to saliency the resolution
process needs to take semantic restrictions into ac-
count (cf. Hegarty et al. (2002)).
The automatic procedure of our research effort
can be envisaged as follows: Given some text we
first locate discourse anaphors. Next, the semantic
(= abstract) type of each anaphor is determined,
based on contextual features that are derived from
annotated corpus data. The anaphor’s semantic
type restricts the semantic type of the antecedent,
and thus narrows down the search space. Finally,
the antecedent is located with the help of these se-
mantic restrictions and, again, with contextual fea-
tures derived from the corpus.

Corpus-based studies have shown that abstract ob-
jects are less salient than other discourse referents,
which has an effect on the choice of the anaphoric
element (Hegarty et al., 2002). The abstract type
of the antecedent and that of the anaphor do not
necessarily coincide. The data suggests that refer-
ence to other types (referred to in the literature as
coercion) is possible only in accordance to an ab-
stractness hierarchy (Hegarty, 2003; Consten and
Knees, 2005; Consten et al., 2007). The hierarchy
starts with events as the most concrete type, which
are anchored in spatial-temporal dimensions, and
ends with propositions as the most abstract types.
Anaphoric reference is possible to antecedents that
are of the same type or less abstract than the
anaphor (Consten and Knees, 2005).
Most works concerning the annotation of
anaphora resolution do not make reference to ab-
stract entities. OntoNotes, for example, only an-
notates reference to verbs (Pradhan et al., 2007).
Annotation research efforts on discourse deixis in-
clude: Eckert and Strube (2000), Byron (2002),
Poesio and Modjeska (2005), Poesio and Artstein
(2008), and M¨uller (2007) for English; Navarretta
(2000) for Danish; and Recasens (2008) for Span-
ish/Catalan. To our knowledge, there has been no
attempt to systematically annotate such a corpus
of German.

3 The Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965066666667">
Our corpus consists of texts from the Europarl cor-
pus (Koehn, 2005). As our basis, we selected all
contributions whose original language is German
(including Austrian German).
For the annotation task, we isolated medium-
sized turns, consisting of 15–20 sentences. This
was done to guarantee that the turns were not
too lengthy but still provided enough information
for the annotators to understand the broader con-
text of discussion, so that they could resolve the
anaphors without comprehension problems. From
these turns, we selected those that contained the
anaphor dies ‘this’. This is the only anaphor in
German which unambiguously refers to discourse
units.

4 The Guidelines
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934090909091">
Our guidelines are based on theoretical research
on discourse semantics as well as work on anno-
tating discourse phenomena.
Given some discourse anaphor (i.e., anaphoric
das, dies, was, es ‘that, this, which, it’), the guide-
lines define (i) how to locate the antecedent, (ii)
how to determine the semantic type of the an-
tecedent, and (iii) how to determine the seman-
tic type of the anaphor. For each of these tasks,
the guidelines provide linguistic tests (Dipper and
Zinsmeister, 2009).

<bodyText confidence="0.999883666666667">
To determine the antecedent of the anaphoric re-
lation, a “paraphrase test” is applied: The anno-

4.2 The semantic type of the antecedent
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887725">
We distinguish 10 types of propositional enti-
ties. Many verbs prototypically denote one type
of propositional entity; gewinnen ‘win’, for in-
stance, usually expresses an event. Often, how-
ever, the type of entity that is denoted depends on
the context and usage of the verb; Hans hat ¨Apfel
gegessen (‘Hans ate apples’) denotes a process,
whereas Hans hat zwei ¨Apfel gegessen (‘Hans ate
two apples’) denotes an event because the action
has an end (when both apples are eaten)—i.e., the
action is telic. The semantic types are defined in
terms of the following features: world-dependent,
time-dependent, dynamic, telic, and modal (with
subtypes deontic and epistemic, generic, subjec-
tive) (see e.g., Vendler (1967), Asher (1993)). Ta-
ble 1 displays the different types of propositional
entities and their defining features. It also lists the
labels used for annotating these entities. The en-
tity types are ordered according to their degree of
abstractness.
The entity type “deict” (deictic) does not fit in
the abstractness hierarchy of the table. It refers
to extra-linguistic entities, such as the external sit-
uation, or an issue that is currently the focus of
attention in parliament, etc.
ample with the identified antecedent underlined. Both the
antecedent and the anaphor are labeled with their seman-
tic types (see below). The Engl line presents an English
translation that is based on the original translations from Eu-
roparl. We used the tool OPUS (http://urd.let.rug.
nl/tiedeman/OPUS) to retrieve the English translations.
2E.g., the anaphor dies alles ‘all this’ often refers to
an antecedent consisting of multiple sentences. The ac-
tual antecedent can diverge from the one constructed by
the paraphrase test in minor aspects, such as active-passive-
alternations, or bare infinitive vs. zu-infinitive vs. participle.
In some cases, the divergences are more important and could
involve, for instance, the insertion or modification of the main
verb. In such cases, annotators were asked to note and record
the differences.

To determine the type of anaphors, we defined a
“replacement test”. With this test, the demonstra-
tive anaphor dies, das, etc. is replaced by a suitable
NP, such as dieses Ereignis, dieser Vorgang. The
head noun indicates the type of the propositional
entity (e.g., event, process).3 Table 1 lists the dif-
ferent types of propositional entities and suitable
replacement nouns. The annotators are asked to
choose the most concrete, suitable noun.

5 Results

<bodyText confidence="0.950508181818182">
As a first pilot study on the reliability of our an-
notation guidelines, two student annotators anno-
tated 32 texts that included 48 instances of the
demonstrative pronoun dies ‘this’. The pronouns
were marked in bold face, and the annotation was
performed on paper. After annotating 17 texts, the
annotators discussed their intermediate results.
Locating the antecedent: In one case, one of
the annotators decided on a deictic reading and did
not mark an antecedent at all. 40 out of 47 an-
tecedents (85%) were marked with identical spans.
In four cases they chose differing but adjacent
spans and in one case one of the annotators chose
a longer string than the other.
The semantic type of the antecedent: The
type of the antecedents coincided in 28 out of 47
cases (60%, α=0.52).4 Agreement improved af-
3We use the term “semantic type of the anaphor” in a
somewhat sloppy way. Put more precisely, the “semantic type
of the anaphor” indicates the way that the anaphor refers to
(parts of) the propositional discourse referent that is denoted
by the antecedent.

ter the discussion period: 11/17 cases matched
(α=0.60).
The semantic type of the anaphor: The results
with respect to the semantic type of the anaphor
seemed more disappointing: the annotators agreed
in only 22 out of 48 instances (46%, α=0.37).
However, after the discussion period, agreement
leveled that of the type of the antecedent: 12 out
of 17 cases coincided (α=0.66). In addition to the
semantic type, we annotated the grammatical role
of the anaphor, which occurred as the subject in
79% of cases and as objects elsewhere.
Annotators agreed most often on the four most
concrete types (‘ev, proc, state, circ’) and least of-
ten on the three most abstract types (‘gen, fact,
prop’). This might be due to the fact that the most
abstract types are applicable in many cases, but an-
notators are advised to choose the most concrete
type that is available. In the majority of the cases
(73%), the anaphor’s type was identical with or
more abstract than the antecedent’s type.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855666666667">
In this paper, we presented a corpus-driven ap-
proach to discourse deictic anaphora in German.
We introduced annotation guidelines that provide
linguistic tests for locating the antecedent, and
for determining the semantic types of both the
antecedent and the anaphor. Further work will
include exploitation of contextual information in
combination with the semantic types to confine the
set of potential antecedents.
Our corpus consists of selected speaker turns
from the Europarl corpus. In this study, 32 texts
(providing 48 instances of discourse deixis) were

annotated according to these guidelines, and first
results concerning inter-annotator agreement are
promising (with an agreement of 85% on the ex-
tension of the antecedent, 60% on the antecedent
type, and 46% on the type of the anaphor). The
pilot study indicates that the paraphrase test helps
the annotators in determining on the extension of
the abstract antecedent.5 It also shows that the lin-
guistic tests for the semantic types have to be re-
fined.
In the next steps, we will switch from paper-
and-pencil annotation to annotation based on the
tool MMAX26. In addition to manually determin-
ing the semantic types of anaphors, we will in-
vestigate robust, fully-automatic approaches to the
derivation of contextual features for anaphora res-
olution. For instance, we plan to take into account
anaphors of the form dieses Ereignis, dieser Um-
stand, etc. (‘this event, this circumstance’), which
explicitly name the semantic type of the anaphor.
In a later step other, more ambiguous, types of
anaphors will be included in the investigation.

This is the only anaphor in German which unambiguously refers to discourse units. 4 The Guidelines Our guidelines are based on theoretical research on discourse semantics as well as work on annotating discourse phenomena. Given some discourse anaphor (i.e., anaphoric das, dies, was, es ‘that, this, which, it’), the guidelines define (i) how to locate the antecedent, (ii) how to determine the semantic type of the antecedent, and (iii) how to determine the semantic type of the anaphor. For each of these tasks, the guidelines provide linguistic tests (Dipper and Zinsmeister, 2009). 4.1 Locating the antecedent To determine the antecedent of the anaphoric relation, a “paraphrase test” is applied: The annotator supplements the anaphor by a paraphrase in the form of n¨amlich ... ‘namely ... ’. The part that fills the ... corresponds to the antecedent that we are looking for, cf.

The discourse entities that are introduced by antecedents of discourse deictic pronouns are called “abstract objects” since they refer to properties and propositional entities (Asher, 1993). Grammatical restrictions cannot apply since the antecedent is non-nominal and the anaphor— commonly in the form of a personal or demonstrative pronoun—is usually in neuter singular. We assume that in addition to saliency the resolution process needs to take semantic restrictions into account (cf. Hegarty et al. (2002)). The automatic procedure of our research effort can be envisaged as follows: Given some text we first locate discourse anaphors. Next, the semantic (= abstract) type of each anaphor is determined, based on contextual features that are derived from annotated corpus data. The anaphor’s semantic type restricts the semantic type of the antecedent, and thus narrows down the search space. Finally, the antecedent is located with the help of these semantic restrictions and, again, with contextual features derived from the corpus. 2 Related Work Corpus-based studies have shown that abstract objects a</context>

The semantic types are defined in terms of the following features: world-dependent, time-dependent, dynamic, telic, and modal (with subtypes deontic and epistemic, generic, subjective) (see e.g., Vendler (1967), Asher (1993)).

The entity types are ordered according to their degree of abstractness. The entity type “deict” (deictic) does not fit in the abstractness hierarchy of the table.

The majority of anaphora are instances of noun phrase anaphora, which relate a noun phrase anaphor to a nominal antecedent. Grammatical restrictions (gender, number agreement) and saliency (grammatical function, recency) guide the resolution process in these cases. In addition to pronouns, definite noun phrases can be viewed as anaphoric in that they may corefer to some other NP in the given context. To solve the latter type of anaphora, lexical semantic knowledge is required, as provided by an ontology or a database like WordNet. Another type of anaphora is discourse deixis (Webber 1988; 1991), which relates a noun phrase anaphor to a verbal or (multi-)clausal antecedent. The discourse entities that are introduced by antecedents of discourse deictic pronouns are called “abstract objects” since they refer to properties and propositional entities (Asher, 1993). Grammatical restrictions cannot apply since the antecedent is non-nominal and the anaphor— commonly in the form of a personal or demonstrative pronoun—is usually in neuter singular.
