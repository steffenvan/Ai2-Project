Welcome to the ACL Workshop on Software, the first of its kind. It is intended as a venue for discussing
and comparing the implementation of software and algorithms used in Natural Language and Speech
Processing. The goal is to bring together researchers, software developers, teachers, and students with
a common interest in the implementation of NLP applications, and to allow useful implementation
techniques and “tricks of the trade” to be discussed in detail and disseminated widely.
We received 13 submissions, of which 8 were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings,
after a careful review process. Because the number of reviewers exceeded the number of submissions,
each submission received more than four reviews on average, while the workload per reviewer was
less than three papers on average. This being the workshop on software, the initial assignment of
reviews was performed algorithmically using the Ford–Fulkerson max-flow algorithm, while taking
into account individual reviewer preferences. The reviewers did an admirable job dealing with a diverse
set of submissions, for which they deserve the thanks of the community.
The papers presented in this workshop deal with many different aspects of NLP software: Carpenter
describes a scalable implementation of high-order character language models; Clegg &amp; Shepherd take
three existing parsers that were trained on business news text and perform a comparative evaluation on
a corpus of biomedical journal papers; Cohen-Sygal &amp; Wintner have implemented a compiler which
translates between the description languages of two different finite state toolboxes; Foster has designed
a generation module for a dialogue system which can ship out text without having to wait for the
planning phase to finish; Koller &amp; Thater describe the intelligent design of increasingly powerful
constraint solvers; Newman proposes a uniform formalism for representing the output of parsers for
easy inspection and comparison; Tr«on, Gyepesi, Hal«acsy, Kornai, N«emeth &amp; Varga have implemented
a generic library for analyzing orthographic words; and White discusses the design of a generation
component which flexibly incorporates language models in a syntactic surface realizer.
The workshop proceedings are being made available in electronic form only. Not only does this save
costs, but it also allows the distribution of additional software and resources that could not be included in
printed proceedings. A number of authors have included the software described in their papers directly
on the proceedings CD. As always, the latest versions of the included software can be found on the
Internet or by contacting the individual authors.
I would like to thank the reviewers and authors once again for their hard work and look forward to an
exciting workshop.
