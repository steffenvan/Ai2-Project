ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.99989735">
This paper addresses the alignment issue in
the framework of exploitation of large bi-
multilingual corpora for translation purposes. A
generic alignment scheme is proposed that can
meet varying requirements of different
applications. Depending on the level at which
alignment is sought, appropriate surface
linguistic information is invoked coupled with
information about possible unit delimiters. Each
text unit (sentence, clause or phrase) is
represented by the sum of its content tags. The
results are then fed into a dynamic programming
framework that computes the optimum alignment
of units. The proposed scheme has been tested at
sentence level on parallel corpora of the CELEX
database. The success rate exceeded 99%. The
next steps of the work concern the testing of the
schemes efficiency at lower levels endowed with
necessary bilingual information about potential
delimiters.

Parallel linguistically meaningful text units
are indispensable in a number of NLP and
lexicographic applications and recently in the so
called Example-Based Machine Translation
(EBMT).
As regards EBMT, a large amount of bi-
multilingual translation examples is stored in a
database and input expressions are rendered in
the target language by retrieving from the
database that example which is most similar to
the input. A task of crucial importance in this
framework, is the establishment of
correspondences between units of multilingual
texts at sentence, phrase or even word level.
The adopted criteria for ascertaining the
adequacy of alignment methods are stated as
follows :

• an alignment scheme must cope with the
embedded extra-linguistic data (tables, anchor
points, SGML markers, etc) and their possible
inconsistencies.
• it should be able to process a large amount
of texts in linear time and in a computationally
effective way.
• in terms of performance a considerable
success rate (above 99% at sentence level) must
be encountered in order to construct a database
with truthfully correspondent units. It is desirable
that the alignment method is language-
independent.
• the proposed method must be extensible to
accommodate future improvements. In addition,

any training or error correction mechanism
should be reliable, fast and should not require
vast amounts of data when switching from a pair
of languages to another or dealing with different
text type corpora.
Several approaches have been proposed
tackling the problem at various levels. [Catizone
89] proposed linking regions of text according to
the regularity of word co-occurrences across
texts.
[Brown 91] described a method based on the
number of words that sentences contain.
Moreover, certain anchor points and paragraph
markers are also considered. The method has
been applied to the Hansard Corpus achieving an
accuracy between 96%-97%.
[Gale 91] [Church 93] proposed a method
that relies on a simple statistical model of
character lengths. The model is based on the
observation that longer sentences in one language
tend to be translated into longer sequences in the
other language while shorter ones tend to be
translated into shorter ones. A probabilistic score
is assigned to each pair of proposed sentence
pairs, based on the ratio of lengths of the two
sentences and the variance of this ratio.

Although the apparent efficacy of the Gale-
Church algorithm is undeniable and validated on
different pairs of languages, it faces problems
when handling complex alignments. The 2-1
alignments had five times the error rate of 1-1.
The 2-2 category disclosed a 33% error rate,
while the 1-0 or 0-1 alignments were totally
missed.
To overcome the inherited weaknesses of the
Gale-Church method, [Simard 92] proposed
using cognates, which are pairs of tokens of
different languages which share &amp;quot;obvious&amp;quot;
phonological or orthographic and semantic
properties, since these are likely to be used as
mutual translations.
In this paper, an alignment scheme is
proposed in order to deal with the complexity of
varying requirements envisaged by different
applications in a systematic way. For example, in
EBMT, the requirements are strict in terms of
information integrity but relaxed in terms of
delay and response time. Our approach is based
on several observations. First of all, we assume
that establishment of correspondences between
units can be applied at sentence, clause, and
phrase level. Alignment at any of these levels has
to invoke a different set of textual and linguistic
information (acting as unit delimiters). In this
paper, alignment is tackled at sentence level.

THE ALIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Content words, unlike functional ones, might
be interpreted as the bearers that convey
information by denoting the entities and their
relationships in the world. The notion of
spreading the semantic load supports the idea
that every content word should be represented as
the union of all the parts of speech we can assign
to it [Basili 92]. The postulated assumption is
that a connection between two units of text is
established if, and only if, the semantic load in
one unit approximates the semantic load of the
other.
Based on the fact that the principal
requirement in any translation exercise is
meaning preservation across the languages of the
translation pair, we define the semantic load of a
sentence as the patterns of tags of its content
words. Content words are taken to be verbs,
nouns, adjectives and adverbs. The complexity of
transfer in translation imposes the consideration
of the number of content tags which appear in a
tag pattern. By considering the total number of
content tags the morphological derivation
procedures observed across languages, e.g. the
transfer of a verb into a verb+deverbal noun
pattern, are taken into account. Morphological
ambiguity problems pertaining to content words
are treated by constructing ambiguity classes
(acs) leading to a generalised set of content tags.
It is essential here to clarify that in this
approach no disambiguation module is
prerequisite. The time breakdown for
morphological tagging, without a disambiguator
device, is according to [Cutting 92] in the order
of 1000 ;Lseconds per token. Thus, tens of
megabytes of text may then be tagged per hour
and high coverage can be obtained without
prohibitive effort.
Having identified the semantic load of a
sentence , Multiple Linear Regression is used to
build a quantitative model relating the content
tags of the source language (SL) sentence to the
response, which is assumed to be the sum of the
counts of the corresponding content tags in the
target language (TL) sentence. The regression
model is fit to a set of sample data which has
been manually aligned at sentence level. Since
we intuitively believe that a simple summation
over the SL content tag counts would be a rather
good estimator of the response, we decide that
the use of a linear model would be a cost-
effective solution.
The linear dependency of y (the sum of the
counts of the content tags in the TL sentence)
upon xi (the counts of each content tag category
and of each ambiguity class over the SL
sentence) can be stated as:
y=b0+b1 xi+b2x2+b3x3+...+bnxn+e (1)
where the unknown parameters {bi} are the
regression coefficients, and s is the error of
estimation assumed to be normally distributed
with zero mean and variance a2.
In order to deal with different taggers and
alternative tagsets, other configurations of (1),
merging acs appropriately, are also
recommended. For example, if an acs accounts
for unknown words, we can use the fact that
most unknown words are nouns or proper nouns
and merge this category with nouns. We can also
merge acs that are represented with only a few
distinct words in the training corpus. Moreover,
the use of relatively few acs (associated with
content words) reduces the number of parameters

to be estimated, affecting the size of the sample
and the time required for training.
The method of least squares is used to
estimate the regression coefficients in (1).
Having estimated the bi and a2, the
probabilistic score assigned to the comparison of
two sentences across languages is just the area
under the N(0,a2) p.d.f., specified by the
estimation error. This probabilistic score is
utilised in a Dynamic Programming (DP)
framework similar to the one described in [Gale
91]. The DP algorithm is applied to aligned
paragraphs and produces the optimum alignment
of sentences within the paragraphs.

The application on which we are developing
and testing the method is implemented on the
Greek-English language pair of sentences of the
CELEX corpus (the computerised documentation
system on European Community Law).
Training was performed on 40 Articles of
the CELEX corpus accounting for 30000 words.
We have tested this algorithm on a randomly
selected corpus of the same text type of about
3200 sentences. Due to the sparseness of acs
(associated only with content words) in our
training data, we reconstruct (1) by using four
variables. For inflective languages like Greek,
morphological information associated to word
forms plays a crucial role in assigning a single
category. Moreover, by counting instances of acs
in the training corpus, we observed that words
that, for example, can be a noun or a verb, are
(due to the lack of the second singular person in
the corpus) exclusively nouns. Hence:
y=130-1-b x +b2x2-1-b3x3+b4x4-Fe (2)
where x1 represents verbs, x2 stands for nouns,
unknown words, vernou (verb or noun) and
nouadj (noun or adjective), x3 adjectives and
veradj (verb or adjective), x4 adverbs and
advadj (adverb or adjective)
a2 was estimated at 3.25 on our training
sample, while the regression coefficients were:

b3 = 0.8584,b4 = 0.7579
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.952109130434783">
An accuracy that approximated a 100%
success rate was recorded. Results are shown in
Table 1. It is remarkable that there is no need for
any lexical constraints or certain anchor points to
improve the performance. Additionally, the same
model and parameters can be used in order to
cope with the infra-sentence alignment.
In order to align all the CELEX texts, we
intend to prepare the material (text handling, pos
tagging in different languages pairs and different
tag sets, etc.) so that we will be able to evaluate
the method on a more reliable basis. We also
hope to test the method&apos;s efficiency at phrase
level endowed with necessary bilingual
information about phrase delimiters. It will be
shown there, that reusability of previous
information facilitates tuning and resolving of
inconsistencies between various delimiters.
