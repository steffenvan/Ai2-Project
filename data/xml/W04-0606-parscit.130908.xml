Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999765588235294">
Mikrokosmos contains an ontology plus a number
of lexicons in different languages that were origi-
nally developed for machine translation. The under-
lying representation formalism for these resources
is an ad-hoc frame-based language which makes it
difficult to inter-operate Mikrokosmos with state-of-
the-art knowledge-based systems.
In this paper we propose a translation from the
frame-based representation of Mikrokosmos into
Description logics. This translation allows us to
automatically transform Mikrokosmos sources into
OWL and thus provide a powerful ontology in the
formalism of the semantic web. Furthermore, the
reasoning mechanisms of Description Logics may
also support knowledge acquisition and mainte-
nance as well as its application in natural language
processing systems.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999869873015873">
The Mikrokosmos project was originally an interlin-
gual system for Knowledge-Based Machine Trans-
lation (KBMT) (Nirenburg, 1987) developed in the
Computing Research Laboratory from New Mexico
State University. Although KBMT was conceived
for translation of domain specific texts, no further
restrictions are imposed in the contents of the text.
Therefore the creators of Mikrokosmos built a rich
ontology that contains a lot of general concepts,
more than 4.700 concepts that are connected with
an average of other 14 concepts using attributes and
relations (de Quesada, 2001).
KBMT is an expensive approach that requires
a big effort on knowledge acquisition, and it has
been considered impractical by some authors. For
that reason, the creators of Mikrokosmos were es-
pecially concerned about developing real-size sys-
tems that would demonstrate the feasibility of their
approach. Generating contents for the ontology was
their first concern, while the use of a rigorous for-
malism for knowledge representation was not con-
sidered a priority (Moreno-Ortiz et al., 2002).
The work presented here is an effort to port
Mikrokosmos into Description Logics (DL) in or-
der to incorporate this resource into the systems we
are developing. Our work on natural language gen-
eration integrates ontologies and case-based reason-
ing (CBR) (Diaz-Agudo et al., 2002), an approach
that heavily relies on classification-based reasoning
from DL.
Representing Mikrokosmos in DL should bring
several benefits. Since DL is the underlying knowl-
edge representation approach in the Semantic Web,
a big number of supporting tools are being de-
veloped for acquiring and maintaining ontologies
represented in some version of DL, such as OWL
(Bechhofer et al., 2004). Giving a well-founded
formal representation to Mikrokosmos should im-
prove its quality by uncovering inconsistencies. Fi-
nally, porting Mikrokosmos to a formalism as pop-
ular as OWL will definitively increase its potential
user community.
There are other efforts that convert ontologies
from different representations to Description Log-
ics languages. OntoMap is a web-site that pro-
vides access to upper-level ontologies and hand-
crafted mappings between them (Kiryakov et al.,
2001). The initial set of ontologies contains Cyc,
EuroWordnet and Mikrokosmos ontology, but it
only deals with the top-level hierarchy. In case of
Mikrokosmos it only contains 13 concepts. Their
main effort involves the mapping between differ-
ent ontologies. They also provide the resources in
DAML+OIL. The project’s goal is to facilitate easy
access, understanding, and reuse of general-purpose
ontologies and upper-level models.
The rest of this paper runs as follows. Next
section describes the frame-based language used in
Mikrokosmos ontology, and Section 3 describes the
DL which is the target of the translation. Section 4
is dedicated to the mapping process and Section 5
evaluates this process. Section 6 points out future
work, and finally Section 7 concludes the paper.

<bodyText confidence="0.996453555555556">
In Mikrokosmos, ontology lists the definitions of
concepts that are understood as corresponding to
classes of thing and events in the world. Concepts
are primitive symbols of a world model which in-
cludes objects, events and properties organized in
a complex hierarchy of language-independent con-
cepts (See top hierarchy of Mikrokosmos in Figure
1). The concepts are constructed following super or-
dinates, or hyponymy relations (IS-A links). In ad-
dition to its organization into a taxonomy via IS-A
links, the ontology contain numerous other links be-
tween concepts, such as links using properties (Lon-
ergan, 2001). For example DECEMBER has a rela-
tion with WINTER using the property PART-OF-
OBJECT.
Each concept that makes up the ontology is lan-
guage independent and is represented using frames.
For example we can see the frame for concept
REPLACEMENT-FOR in Table 1.
The format of Mikrokosmos Ontology is de-
scribed in detail in (Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004).
It formally introduces the syntax and the semantics
of the ontology using a BNF grammar. We are most
interested in how we can access to this information.
Ontology is saved in a text file using Spencer no-
tation that is based on XML. There is another nota-
tion called Beale notation that is based on Lisp, but
we will focus on Spencer notation.
In the XML based format we have the whole on-
tology represented in a list of RECORD entries.
Definition of one CONCEPT requires one or more
of these RECORD entries. Each entry contains four
fields, that are: CONCEPT, SLOT, FACET, and
FILLER.
The CONCEPT field can be filled by any Name
of a concept of the ontology.
The second field in each entry is SLOT. This
field can be filled with PROPERTY or any of its
subclasses using IS-A links. There are two kind
of slot fillers. One type are descendants of AT-
TRIBUTE or RELATION, that represent links be-
tween concepts in the hierarchy. The other type are
descendants of ONTOLOGY-SLOT. We will call
them special slots, and all of them have the sense of
determining the structure of the ontology. Possible
descendants of ONTOLOGY-SLOT are: DEFINI-
TION, DOMAIN, INSTANCES, INVERSE, IS-A,
RANGE, SUBCLASSES and some others that are
less important; later in this section we will explain
them in detail.
The third field is FACET, and it describes some
finer distinctions between the possible fillers of the
slot. Possibles FACET fillers are: VALUE, SEM,
DEFAULT, INV, NOT, DEFAULT, DEFAULT-
MEASURE and RELAXABLE-TO.
The last field is FILLER, and its value depends
on the other fields, but generally it contains either a
Name of a concept of the ontology or an instance.
Initially we can think that there are no restrictions
in these representations, but there are some spe-
cial slots that limit expressiveness. All CONCEPT
frames have non-special and special slots. Special
slots for all kinds of concepts are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9853315">
• DEFINITION: Definition in English of the
concept.
• IS-A: It is used for asserting parents in the hi-
erarchy.
• SUBCLASSES: It is used for listing concept
children.
• INSTANCES, SPANISH1, ENGLISH1: They
are only used in the leaves of OBJECT and
EVENT, and contains words of the dictionary.
Special slots which can only be present in
all PROPERTY and only in PROPERTY concept
frames are:
• DOMAIN: It has fillers usually filled with
EVENTsl and/or OBJECTs and it determines
whether a CONCEPT can have it as a SLOT.
• RANGE: It is used in RELATIONs and AT-

TRIBUTEs. In RELATIONs the RANGE slot
has only the SEM facet. The fillers of the SEM
facet are the names of concepts that are in the
range of this RELATION. In ATTRIBUTEs
the RANGE slot has only a VALUE facet. The
VALUE facet is filled by all the possible literal
or numerical values permissible for that AT-
TRIBUTE. The filler can also be a numerical
range specified using appropriate mathemati-
cal comparison operators (such as &gt;, &lt;, ...).

scendants of the SCALAR-ATTRIBUTE con-

to add a measuring unit for the number or
scalar range that fills facets of the RANGE slot
in SCALAR-ATTRIBUTE concept frames.
The facet fillers of the MEASURED-IN
slot are the daughters of the MEASURING-
UNIT concept. The MEASURED-IN slot
is used only in those SCALAR-ATTRIBUTE
frames where MEASURING-UNIT has physi-
cal sense (e.g. for SIZE, AGE, etc.).

DL are a family of logical formalisms that origi-
nated in the field of artificial intelligence as a tool
for representation of conceptual knowledge. Since
then, DLs have been successfully used in a wide
range of application areas such as knowledge repre-
sentation, reasoning about class-based formalisms
(e.g. conceptual database models and UML dia-
grams), and ontology engineering in the context of
the semantic web. The basic syntactic entities of DL
are concepts, which are constructed from concept

names (unary predicates) and role names (binary
predicates) using the set of concept and role con-
structors provided by a particular DL (Lutz, 2003).
Our interest in Mikrokosmos ontology is to map
its contents to a DL language. We have chosen
AGCQHZI,+ also known as SHZQ (Horrocks et
al., 2000).
SHZQ is the basic logic AGC augmented with
qualifying number restrictions, role restrictions,
role hierarchies, inverse roles, and transitive roles.
AGC comprises concepts —denoting sets— as
well as roles —denoting binary relations. Unlike
roles, concepts can be compound. Compound con-
cepts are constructed by the following operators: in-
tersection n, union U, complementation ¬ —taking
concepts as arguments—, and the value restrictions
V, and I —taking a role and a concept as their ar-
guments. Formally, AGC is given by the following
formation rules, where c denotes a concept symbol
and r a role symbol (Schild, 1991):

<bodyText confidence="0.9974915">
DL SHZQ is implemented in the RACER sys-
tem (Haarslev and Moller, 2003). This makes it a
desirable target representation for our ontology. For
describing our ontology in SHZQ we will use the
notation explained in Table 2, that contains denota-
tional semantics for our language translation.

Once we have identified DL language we want
to use —SHZQ— and we have described the
Mikrokosmos ontology, we can proceed to map it.
The first step is to determine whether a concept
is a class or a slot. Although in the Mikrokosmos
ontology everything is a concept we need to dis-
tinguish between Mikrokosmos concepts that cor-
respond to unary predicates —which map to DL
classes— and Mikrokosmos concepts that corre-
spond to binary predicates —which map to DL rela-
tions. EVENT, OBJECT and all of their subclasses
will be unary predicates so they will be classes.
Meanwhile PROPERTY and all its hierarchy ex-
cept ONTOLOGY-SLOTs (see Figure 1) will be bi-
nary predicates so they will be slots. There are
a few exceptions: concept ALL is top in DL and
ONTOLOGY-SLOT and all of their subclasses are
not mapped to DL language because they have the

Mikrokosmos has some information that can not
be mapped to a DL language. We will address this
problem in two ways. First we will make some an-
notations to class and slots that are not supported
by DL language, but which could be provided by
RDFS based languages. Second, extra information
about slots that is not supported by DL language
will be stored in special concepts created from the
corresponding slots.

4.3 Building Mikrokosmos PROPERTYs as
DL classes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999789857142857">
As we have seen in previous subsection, not all in-
formation about PROPERTYs can be mapped easily
to slots. Because of that we have decided to include
an extra hierarchy of concepts created from PROP-
ERTYs.
For each slot we create a class that inherits
from CLASS-SLOT called CLASS-&lt;PROPERTY-
NAME&gt;. These classes contain all information
about the PROPERTYs that we could not represent
in a DL relation.
For each SLOT applied to a CONCEPT we will
create a class that inherits from CLASS-SLOT-
CONCEPT called CLASS-&lt;PROPERTY-NAME&gt;-
&lt;CONCEPT-NAME&gt;. These classes have slot-
constraints in order to define information not cap-
tured in the respective concept.
With this structure of classes we do not lose any
information about slots and slot-constraints but al-
most all information stored in that way is not useful
for reasoning in current tools like RACER (Haarslev
and Moller, 2001).

5 Evaluation of the translation process
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999738894736842">
DL provide the way to carry out complex inference
and reasoning tasks. In order to achieve this goal
our DL language is less expressive than Mikrokos-
mos. Among all restrictions in the expressiveness of
DL languages we will mention two. DL languages
are not able to reason with default values for the re-
strictions. And they do not manage finite domains
such as enumerates or sets.
These differences in expressivity between
Mikrokosmos and our DL language has as a result
some interesting points in the translation process.
There were two possible solutions to this problem.
First one was to discard all information that has not
a direct mapping to our DL language. And second
one —which we have chosen— is to make some
artifices in order to preserve all information, but
obviously we cannot reason with this information.
There are two places where we have made this
kind of artifices:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9515438">
• Default values: Mikrokosmos is able of man-
aging default values for restrictions while DL
is not. So we have decided to store it as an
annotation.
• Numeric restrictions: For example in

<bodyText confidence="0.991381444444445">
Mikrokosmos we can restrict the age of a
person to be plus than 0 and minus that 120,
but our DL language is not capable. Because
of that we have created the complex structure
of Numeric-Range concepts.
So we can say that we have no loss of information
in the translation process. But we were incapable to
use all information contained in Mikrokosmos for
reasoning and inference tasks.

that was associated with those concepts for realiza-
tion in a particular language. This peculiarity al-
lowed relatively easy bidirectional translation be-
tween different languages via an intermediate con-
ceptual representation.
Subsequent uses and/or transformations of these
resources must take into account this peculiarity. In
our case, the work carried out so far in transport-
ing the Mikrokosmos ontology to OWL has been
restricted to the part of the ontology concerned
with the conceptual representation. Although this
transformation already opens up avenues of re-
search for knowledge representation for problem
solving (Diaz-Agudo and Gonz´alez-Calero, 2002),
the number of useful applications of the results of
this process in the field of natural language process-
ing will increase greatly once the corresponding lex-
icons —there are currently versions in Spanish and
English— are also transformed into OWL.
For instance, use of this resource provides the
means for intelligently substituting a given word for
a different one - as required for example in our po-
etry generation system (Diaz-Agudo et al., 2002)
during the adaptation of the structure of poem from
the case base to obtain a verse approximation of a
user query. Assuming that a structure such as:
Sabed que en mi perfecta edad y armado
con mis ojos abiertos me he rendido
al ni˜no que sab´eis ciego y desnudo.
needs to be adapted, and the adaptation requires the
substitution of the verb “sabed” for a related one out
of a list of candidates - possibly obtained from the
given user query - such as “pensad”, “cortad” and
“saltad”. By conuslting the structure of the ontology
—see extract in Figure 7 for illustration— the sys-
tem may correctly select “pensad” as a preferable
candidate in view of its proximity in the ontology to
the original word.
Our future lines of research in this field will focus
in a deeper study of which concepts are primitive
and which ones are defined. Now we have decided
that all concepts having any restriction are defined
concepts. This decission was taken in orden to rea-
son with the ontology but it is necessary to examine
it in detail.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914875">
Mikrokosmos ontology is a rich and extensive
knowledge resource that was developed with a pro-
prietary formalism, with a weak theoretical founda-
tion. We have analysed the contents of the ontology
which have lead us to propose a possible translation
into description logics.
All this effort of understanding Mikrokosmos
ontology and mapping it to a description logics
language has resulted in a concrete implementa-
tion. We have chosen OWL —an RDFS based
language—, in its version idOWL DL. This version
implements reasoning using JENA (McBride, 2001)
and the DIG interface (Bechhofer et al., 2003).
There are two inference engines that implement the
DIG interface: RACER and FaCT4. As part of this
implementation we have developed an import plu-
gin for Prot´eg´e 2.0 (See Figure 7).
With this work we can profit from all the knowl-
edge stored in the Mikrokosmos ontology for other
tasks related to Artificial Intelligence. These tasks
are Natural Language Processing and Knowledge-
Intensive Case-Based Reasoning. We still have to
translate the Mikrokosmos lexicon in order to fully
exploit the original resource.

<abstract confidence="0.999281277777778">Mikrokosmos contains an ontology plus a number of lexicons in different languages that were originally developed for machine translation. The underlying representation formalism for these resources is an ad-hoc frame-based language which makes it difficult to inter-operate Mikrokosmos with state-ofthe-art knowledge-based systems. In this paper we propose a translation from the frame-based representation of Mikrokosmos into Description logics. This translation allows us to automatically transform Mikrokosmos sources into OWL and thus provide a powerful ontology in the formalism of the semantic web. Furthermore, the reasoning mechanisms of Description Logics may also support knowledge acquisition and maintenance as well as its application in natural language processing systems.</abstract>

For each SLOT applied to a CONCEPT we will create a class that inherits from CLASS-SLOTCONCEPT called CLASS-&lt;PROPERTY-NAME&gt;- &lt;CONCEPT-NAME&gt;. These classes have slotconstraints in order to define information not captured in the respective concept. With this structure of classes we do not lose any information about slots and slot-constraints but almost all information stored in that way is not useful for reasoning in current tools like RACER (Haarslev and Moller, 2001). 5 Evaluation of the translation process DL provide the way to carry out complex inference and reasoning tasks. In order to achieve this goal our DL language is less expressive than Mikrokosmos. Among all restrictions in the expressiveness of DL languages we will mention two. DL languages are not able to reason with default values for the restrictions. And they do not manage finite domains such as enumerates or sets. These differences in expressivity between Mikrokosmos and our DL language has as a result some interesting points in the translation process. There were two possible solutions to</context>

The first step is to determine whether a concept is a class or a slot.

Concepts are primitive symbols of a world model which includes objects, events and properties organized in a complex hierarchy of language-independent concepts (See top hierarchy of Mikrokosmos in Figure 1). The concepts are constructed following super ordinates, or hyponymy relations (IS-A links). In addition to its organization into a taxonomy via IS-A links, the ontology contain numerous other links between concepts, such as links using properties (Lonergan, 2001). For example DECEMBER has a relation with WINTER using the property PART-OFOBJECT. Each concept that makes up the ontology is language independent and is represented using frames. For example we can see the frame for concept REPLACEMENT-FOR in Table 1. The format of Mikrokosmos Ontology is described in detail in (Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004). It formally introduces the syntax and the semantics of the ontology using a BNF grammar. We are most interested in how we can access to this information.

KBMT is an expensive approach that requires a big effort on knowledge acquisition, and it has been considered impractical by some authors. For that reason, the creators of Mikrokosmos were especially concerned about developing real-size systems that would demonstrate the feasibility of their approach. Generating contents for the ontology was their first concern, while the use of a rigorous formalism for knowledge representation was not considered a priority (Moreno-Ortiz et al., 2002). The work presented here is an effort to port Mikrokosmos into Description Logics (DL) in order to incorporate this resource into the systems we are developing. Our work on natural language generation integrates ontologies and case-based reasoning (CBR) (Diaz-Agudo et al., 2002), an approach that heavily relies on classification-based reasoning from DL. Representing Mikrokosmos in DL should bring several benefits. Since DL is the underlying knowledge representation approach in the Semantic Web, a big number of supporting tools are being developed for acquiring and maintaining ontologies repre</context>

The concepts are constructed following super ordinates, or hyponymy relations (IS-A links). In addition to its organization into a taxonomy via IS-A links, the ontology contain numerous other links between concepts, such as links using properties (Lonergan, 2001). For example DECEMBER has a relation with WINTER using the property PART-OFOBJECT. Each concept that makes up the ontology is language independent and is represented using frames. For example we can see the frame for concept REPLACEMENT-FOR in Table 1. The format of Mikrokosmos Ontology is described in detail in (Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004). It formally introduces the syntax and the semantics of the ontology using a BNF grammar. We are most interested in how we can access to this information. Ontology is saved in a text file using Spencer notation that is based on XML. There is another notation called Beale notation that is based on Lisp, but we will focus on Spencer notation. In the XML based format we have the whole ontology represented in a list of RECORD entries. Definition of one CONCEPT requires one or more of these RECORD entries. Each entry contains four fields, that are: CONCEPT, SLOT, FACET, and FILLER. The CONCEPT fie</context>

In this paper we propose a translation from the frame-based representation of Mikrokosmos into Description logics. This translation allows us to automatically transform Mikrokosmos sources into OWL and thus provide a powerful ontology in the formalism of the semantic web. Furthermore, the reasoning mechanisms of Description Logics may also support knowledge acquisition and maintenance as well as its application in natural language processing systems. 1 Introduction The Mikrokosmos project was originally an interlingual system for Knowledge-Based Machine Translation (KBMT) (Nirenburg, 1987) developed in the Computing Research Laboratory from New Mexico State University. Although KBMT was conceived for translation of domain specific texts, no further restrictions are imposed in the contents of the text. Therefore the creators of Mikrokosmos built a rich ontology that contains a lot of general concepts, more than 4.700 concepts that are connected with an average of other 14 concepts using attributes and relations (de Quesada, 2001). KBMT is an expensive approach that requires a big effort on knowledge acquisition, and it has been considered impractical by some authors. For that re</context>

AGC comprises concepts —denoting sets— as well as roles —denoting binary relations. Unlike roles, concepts can be compound. Compound concepts are constructed by the following operators: intersection n, union U, complementation ¬ —taking concepts as arguments—, and the value restrictions V, and I —taking a role and a concept as their arguments. Formally, AGC is given by the following formation rules, where c denotes a concept symbol and r a role symbol (Schild, 1991): C,D −� c |T |C n D |¬C |VR.C R −� r DL SHZQ is implemented in the RACER system (Haarslev and Moller, 2003). This makes it a desirable target representation for our ontology. For describing our ontology in SHZQ we will use the notation explained in Table 2, that contains denotational semantics for our language translation. 4 Mikrokosmos mapping to SHIQ Once we have identified DL language we want to use —SHZQ— and we have described the Mikrokosmos ontology, we can proceed to map it. The first step is to determine whether a concept is a class or a slot. Although in the Mikrokosmos ontology ever</context>
