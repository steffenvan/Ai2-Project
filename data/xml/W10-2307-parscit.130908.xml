Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998705">
The talk will commence by discussing some of the problems that arise when machine learning is
applied to graph structures. A taxonomy of different methods organised around a) clustering b)
characterisation and c) constructing generative models in the graph domain will be introduced.
With this taxonomy in hand, Dr. Hancock will then describe a number of graph-spectral al-
gorithms that can be applied to solve the many different problems inherent to graphs, drawing
examples from computer vision research.
