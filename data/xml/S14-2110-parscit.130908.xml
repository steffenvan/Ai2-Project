This paper presents a word-for-word trans-
lation approach using Wiktionary for
SemEval-2014 Task 5. The language
pairs attempted for this task were English-
Spanish and English-German. Since this
approach did not take context into account,
it performed poorly.

<bodyText confidence="0.999579518518518">
The objective of SemEval-2014 Task 5 is to trans-
late a few words or a phrase from one language
(L1) into another (L2). More specifically, a sen-
tence containing primarily L2 and a few L1 words
is provided, and the task is to translate the L1
words into the L2. This task is similar to the previ-
ous cross-linguistic SemEval tasks involving lexi-
cal substitution (Mihalcea et al., 2010) and word-
sense disambiguation (Lefever and Hoste, 2013).
For example, consider the following sentence,
written entirely in German except for one English
word: Aber auf diesem Schiff wollen wir auch
Ruderer sein, wir sitzen im selben Boot und wollen
mit Ihnen row. Here, the word row is polysemous
and can be translated as the verb rudern or as the
noun Reihe depending on context. The words to
be translated can also form an idiomatic expres-
sion, such as in exchange in die 1967 eroberten
arabischen Gebiete in exchange gegen Frieden.
These examples reveal that this is not a straightfor-
ward task, as word-for-word translation may give
inaccurate results.
Wiktionary is a multilingual dictionary con-
taining word-sense, examples, sample quotations,
collocations, usage notes, proverbs and transla-
tions (Torsten et al., 2008; Meyer and Gurevych,
2012). Since Wiktionary data have previously

been used for translations (Orlandi and Passant,
2010), it was chosen for looking up the transla-
tion of source language (L1) words. However, the
translation approach was word-for-word and ig-
nored the target language (L2) context, i.e., the
context in which the text fragment to be trans-
lated is found. The Wiktionary-based solution
is for English-to-Spanish and English-to-German
language translation though four language pairs
were provided in this shared task.

For a given word, the English version of Wik-
tionary gives not only its definition but also possi-
ble translations. The translations are divided based
on part of speech (PoS) and word sense and at
times also encode gender and number informa-
tion. For example, the German and Spanish trans-
lations for the English word book are stored in
Wiktionary as follows:

used to look up the translations for the task.
Wiktionary also contains lists of the 10000 most
frequent words in Spanish and of the 2000 most
frequent words in German. This information was
used to sort the target language words in the hash
table in decreasing order of frequency. The trans-
lations absent from these frequency lists were kept
in the hash table in the order that they were ex-
tracted from Wiktionary.

The TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) was used to
parse the English (L1) phrases to obtain the PoS of
each word along with the lemma. The PoS tags re-
turned by the TreeTagger were mapped to the PoS
used in Wiktionary as shown in Table 1. The word
and its PoS were searched for in the hash table. If
the translation was not found, then the lemma and
its PoS were looked up. If the lemma lookup also
failed then the phrase was not translated.
Once the L2 words were obtained for all the L1
words in the phrase, the L2 words were matched
based on the gender and number information pro-
vided. For example, for the phrase this ques-
tion, Wiktionary offered este|m and esta|f as
Spanish translations of this, and interrogante|m
pregunta|f duda|f cuesti´on|f inc´ognita|f for
question. The translations were paired based on
gender agreement rules (e.g. este interrogante,
where both are masculine, and esta pregunta,
where both are feminine) and provided as solu-
tions.

gated (finite) verbs. Lack of this inflectional infor-
mation degraded the overall performance of both
English-to-Spanish and English-to-German trans-
lations. Two rules were included in an attempt to
improve the English-to-Spanish translations: (1)
plural nouns and adjectives were formed by adding
-s or -es, and (2) where a noun was preceded by
an adjective in a L1 phrase, after the translation,
the positions of the noun and the adjective were
switched to respect the noun-adjective word order
that is more commonly found in Spanish.

4 Results and Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996429032258">
Table 2 shows the performance of the system
for the English-to-Spanish and English-to-German
translations. The approach in bold was submit-
ted for evaluation. The accuracy refers to the per-
centage of the fragments that were predicted accu-
rately, whereas word accuracy measures the par-
tially correct solutions. For each fragment, up to
5 translations could be submitted with one consid-
ered as the best answer and the rest regarded as
alternatives. The best evaluation considered only
the best answers. On the other hand, oof (out-of-
five) evaluation considered the alternative answers
to calculate the scores if the best answer was in-
correct.
A context-independent, word-for-word transla-
tion approach to L2 Writing Assistant was pro-
posed. The mediocre performance was due to
the fact the approach was very basic. The sys-
tem can be significantly improved by using the
Spanish and German versions of Wiktionary to
make up for the translations missing from the
English version and by considering the L2 con-
text provided. One such example in the German
Wiktionary is the ffCharakteristische
Wortkombinationen}} tag, which refers to
the possible collocations. For example, one of
the translations of the English word exchange in
German is Austausch, which is most often col-
located with im or als. Also, using a tool like
JWKTL2 would improve the quality of informa-
tion extracted from Wiktionary.
