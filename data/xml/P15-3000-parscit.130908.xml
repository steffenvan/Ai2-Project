Welcome to the ACJ-IJCNLP 2015 Student Research Workshop!
Following the tradition of the previous years’ workshops, we have two tracks: research papers and thesis
proposals. The research papers track is as a venue for Ph.D. students, masters students, and advanced
undergraduates to describe completed work or work-in-progress along with preliminary results. The
thesis proposal track is offered for advanced Ph.D. students who have decided on a thesis topic and are
interested in feedback about their proposal and ideas about future directions for their work.
We received in total 18 submissions: 5 thesis proposals and 13 research papers. Of these, we accepted
3 thesis proposals and 4 research papers, giving an acceptance rate of 39% overall: 60% for thesis
proposals and 31% for research papers.
This year, all of the accepted papers will be presented as posters alongside the main conference short
paper posters on the second day of the conference. In addition, authors will each have a chance to give a
short oral presentation to advertise their work. The oral session will be held on immediately prior to the
poster session.
Mentoring programs are a central part of the SRW. This year, students had the opportunity to participate
in a pre-submission mentoring program prior to the submission deadline. The mentoring offers students
a chance to receive comments from an experienced researcher in the field, in order to improve the quality
of the writing and presentation before making their final submission. Fourteen authors participated in the
pre-submission mentoring, more than twice as many as participated last year.
In addition, authors of accepted papers are matched with mentors who will meet with the students in
person during the workshop. This year, each research paper is assigned two mentors and each thesis
proposal is assigned one mentor. Each mentor will prepare in-depth comments and questions prior to the
student’s presentation, and will provide discussion and feedback during the workshop.
We are very grateful for the generous financial support from BAOBAG Language Solutions, Google,
the Don and Betty Walker Scholarship Fund, and the National Science Foundation. The support of our
sponsors allows the SRW to cover the travel and lodging expenses of the authors, keeping the workshop
accessible to all students.
We would also like to thank our program committee members for their constructive reviews for each
paper and all of our mentors for donating their time to work one-on-one with our student authors. Thank
you to our faculty advisers for their advice and guidance, and to the ACL-IJCNLP 2015 organizing
committee for their constant support. Finally, a huge thank you to all students for their submissions and
their participation in this year’s SRW. Looking forward to a wonderful workshop!
