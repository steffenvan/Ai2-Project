Extensively annotated bilingual parallel corpora
can be exploited to feed editing tools that in-
tegrate the processes of document composition
and translation. Here we discuss the archi-
tecture of an interactive editing tool that, on
top of techniques common to most Translation
Memory-based systems, applies the potential of
SGML&apos;s DTDs to guide the process of bilingual
document generation. Rather than employing
just simple task-oriented mark-up, we selected a
set of TEI&apos;s highly complex and versatile collec-
tion of tags to help disclose the underlying log-
ical structure of documents in the test-corpus.
DTDs were automatically induced and later in-
tegrated in the editing tool to provide the basic

This paper discusses an approach to the archi-
tecture of an experimental interactive editing
tool that integrates the processes of source doc-
ument composition and translation into the tar-
get language. The tool has been conceived as an
optimal solution for a particular case of bilin-
gual production of legal documentation, but it
also illustrates in a more general way how to ex-
ploit the possibilities of SGML (IS08879, 1986)
used extensively to annotate a whole range of
linguistic and extralinguistic information in spe-
cialized bilingual corpora.
SGML is well established as the coding
scheme underlying- most Translation Memory
based systems (TMBS), and has been pro-
posed as the coding scheme for the interchange
of existing Translation Memory databases -
Translation Memories eXchange, TMX (Melby.
1998). The advantages of SGML have also been
perceived by a large community of corpus lin-
guistics researchers. and big efforts have been
made in the development of suitable markup
options to encode a variety of textual types and
functions -as clearly demonstrated by the Text
Encoding Initiative, TEI; (Burnard &amp; Speberg-
MacQueen, 1995). While the tag-sets employed
by TMBS are simple and task-oriented, TEl has
offered a highly complex and versatile collection
of tags. The guiding hypothesis in our experi-
ment has been the idea that it is possible to
explore TEI/SGML markup in order to develop
a system that carries the concept of Translation
Memory one step further. One important fea-
ture of SGML is the DTD. DTDs determine the
logical structure of documents and how to tag
them accordingly. We have concentrated on the
accurate description of documents by means of
TEl conformant SGML markup. The markup
will help disclose the underlying logical struc-
ture of documents. From annotated documen-
tation, DTDs can be induced and these DTDs
provide the basic scheme to produce new doc-
uments. We have collected a corpus of official
publications from three main institutions in the
Basque Autonomous Region in Spain, the Bo-
letin Oficial de Bizkaia (BOB, 1990-1995). Bo-
letin Oficial de Alava (BOA, 1990-1994) and
Boletin Oficial del Pais Vasco (BOPV, 1995).
Documents in the corpus were composed by Ad-
ministration clerks and translated by transla-
tors. Both clerks and translators have been us-
ing a wide variety of word-processors, although
since 1994 MS Word has been generalized as the
standard editing tool. Administrative docu-
mentation shows a regular structure, and is rich
in recurrent textual patterns. - For each docu-
ment type different document tokens share a
common global distribution of elements. Of-
ficial document composers learn these global
structures and apply them consistently. It is
also the case that composers tend to reuse old

document files when producing new documents
of the same type. Despite the fact that no
SGML software was used at the editing phase,
texts in the corpus show regular logical struc-
tures and consistent distribution of text seg-
ments. Our main goal in tagging the corpus was
to make all them explicit (Martinez, 1997). The
most common type of document in the corpus,
the Orden Foral, was chosen (see Table 1). We
analysed some 100 tokens and hand-marked the
most salient elements. The heuristics to identify
these elements were later expressed in a collec-
tion of recognition routines in Perl and tested
against a set of 400 tokens, including the initial
100. As a result of this process of automatic
tagging of structural elements we produced a
TEI/SGML tagged corpus with yet no corre-
sponding overt DTD. In Section 2 we will ex-
plain how DTDs were later induced from the
tagged corpus.
Once the corpus was segmented the next step
was to align it. This was conducted at different
levels: general document elements (DIV, SEG,
P), as well as sentential and intra-sentential el-
ements, such as S, RS, NUM, DATE, etc. (Mar-
tinez, 1998b). Aligned in this way, the corpus
becomes an important resource for translation.
Four complementary language databases may
be obtained at any time from the annotated
corpus: three translation memory databases
(TM I, TM2, and TM3) as well as a terminology
database (termbase). The three TMs differ in
the nature of the translation units they contain.
TM1 consists of aligned sentences than can feed
commercial TM software. TM2 contains ele-
ments which are translation segments ranging
from whole sections of a document or multi-
sentence paragraphs to smaller units. such as
short phrases or proper names. TM3 simply
hosts the whole collection of aligned bilingual
documents, where the whole document may
be considered the translation unit. TM3 can
be&apos;construett as--a hilingwidocirment-database.
Much redundancy originates from this TM col-
lection, although it should be noticed that they
are all by-products derived from the same an-
notated bitext which subsumes them all. Good
software packages for TM1 and TM3 already ex-
ist in the market, and hence their exploitation is
beyond our interest (Trados Translator&apos;s Work-
bench, Star&apos;s Transit,â€žSDLX Deja Vii IBM&apos;s
Translation Manager) for TM1; and any SGML
browsing tool for TM3). The originality of our
editing tool lies in a design which benefits from
joining the potentiality of DTDs and the ele-
ments in TM2, as will be shown in sections 4
and 5.

DTDs have been abstracted away from the an-
notations that were automatically introduced
in the corpus. Similar experiments have been
reported before in the literature. (Ahonen,
1995) uses a method to build document in-
stances from tagged texts that consists of a de-
terministic finite automaton for each context
model. Subsequently, these automata are gen-
eralized and converted into regular expressions
which are easily transcribed into SGML content
models. (Shafer, 1995) combines document in-
stances with simplification rules. Our method
is similar to Shafer&apos;s, but with a. modification
in the way rules reduce document instanCes. A
tool to obtain a DTD for all document instances
has been developed (Casillas, 1999). Given that
source and target documents show some syn-
tactic and structural mismatches, two different
DTDs are induced, one for each language, and

respondences in this table can be up-dated, or
deleted. At present, we have six DTDs, one for
each document type in each language (there are
three document types; Figure 2 shows a part of
one of these DTDs). By means of these paired
DTDs, document elements in each language are
appropriately placed. In the process of gener-
ating the bilingual document, a document type
must first be selected. Each document type has
an associated DTD. This DTD specifies which
elements are obligatory and which are optional.
With the aid of the DTD, the source document
is generated. The target document will be gen-
erated with the aid of the corresponding target
DTD.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954377818181818">
TM2 specifically stores a type of translation
segment class, which we have tagged &lt;segl&gt;,
&lt;seg2&gt;... &lt;segn&gt;, &lt;title&gt; and &lt;rs&gt;, and
which is relevant to the DTD. Segments tagged
&lt;segn&gt; are variable recurrent language pat-
terns very frequent in the specialized domain
of the corpus and whose occurrence in the text
is well established. These &lt;segn&gt; tags in-
clude two attributes: id and correspond which
locate the aligned segment both in the cor-
pus and in the database (Figure 1). Seg-
ments tagged &lt;rs&gt; are referring expressions
which have been recognized, tagged and aligned
â€¢ and which correspond largely to proper names
(Martinez, 1998a), (Martinez, 1998b). TM2 is
managed in the form of a relational database
-where -segments are stored as records. .Each
record in the database consists of four fields:
the segment string, a counter for the occur-
rences of that string in the corpus, the tag
and the attributes (type, id and corresp).

the &lt;/divi&gt;...&lt;/divO&gt; tags of Figure 1 ren-
ders three records in the database. Note how
the content of the string field in the database
maintains only the initial &lt;segn&gt; and &lt;rs&gt;
tags. Furthermore, &lt;rs&gt; tagged segments in-
side &lt;segn&gt; records are simplified so that their
content is dismissed and only the initial tag is
kept (Lange et al., 1997). The reason is that
they are considered variable elements within
the segment (dates and numbers are also these
type of elements). The strings Orden Foral of
record 2 marked as &lt;rs type=law&gt; and Sala
de lo Contencioso-Administrativo del Tribunal
Superior de Justicia del Pais Vasco of record
3 &lt;rs type=organization&gt; are thus not in-
cluded in record 1 &lt;seg9&gt;, since they may dif-
fer in other instantiations of the segment. These
internal elements are largely proper names that
vary from one instantiation of the segment to
another. The &lt;rs&gt; tag can be considered
to be the name of the varying element. The
value of the type attribute &lt;rs type=law&gt;
constraints the kind of referential expression
that may be inserted in that point of the trans-
lation segment. Table 2 shows that source
and target records may not have straight one-
to-one correspondences. Although this is by
no means the general case; only about 5.61%,
(Martinez. 1998a), such one-to-N correspon-
dences provide good ground to explain how
the TM2 is designed. The asymmetry can be
easily explained. The Spanish term recursÂ°
contencioso-administrativo has been translated
into Basque by means of a category changing
operation, where the Spanish adjective admin-
istrativo has been translated as a Basque noun
complement Administrazioarekiko which liter-
ally means &amp;quot;Administration-the-with-of&amp;quot; trig-
gering its identification as a proper noun.
Table 3 shows the way in which source lan-
guage units are related with their correspond-
ing target units, which, as can be observed, can
be one-to-one or one-to-N. This means that one
source element can have more than one transla-
tion.
TM2 is created in three steps:
O First, non-pertinent tags are filtered out
from the annotated corpus. Tags marking
sentence &lt;s&gt; and paragraph &lt;p&gt; align-
ment are removed because they are of no
interest for TM2 (recall that they are reg-
istered in TM1).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.985506">
O Second, translation segments &lt;segn&gt;.
&lt;title&gt; phrases and referential expres-
sions &lt;rs&gt; are detected in the source doc-
ument and looked up in the database.
o Third, if they are not already present in
the database, they are stored each in its
database and values of the id and corresp
â€¢ attributes are- used to set the correspon-
dence between source and target database.

which control the application of this markup.
The composition process follows two main steps
which correspond to the traditional source doc-
ument generation and translation into the tar-
get document. The markup and the paired
DTD guides the process in the following man-
ner:
1. Before the user starts writing the source
document, he must select a document type,
i.e., a DTD. This has two consequences. On
the one hand, the selected DTD produces
a source document template that contains
the logical structure of the document and
some of its contents. On the other hand,
the selected source ,DTD triggers a target
paired DTD, which will be used later to
translate the document. There are three
different types of elements in the source
document template:
a Some elements are mandatory and are
provided to the user, who must only
choose its content among some alter-
native usages (s/he will get a list of
alternatives ordered by frequency, for
example &lt;title&gt;). Other obligatory
elements, such as dates and numbers,
will also be automatically generated.
a Some other elements in the template
are optional (e.g., &lt;seg9&gt;). Again.
a list of alternatives will be offered to
the user. These optional elements are
sensitive to the context (document or
division type), and markup is also re-
sponsible for constraining the valid op-
tions given-tothe user.. Obligatory and
optional elements are retrieved from
TM2, and make a considerable part of
the source document.

most variable part, and the system lets
the writer input text freely. It is when
TM2 has nothing to offer that TM1
and TM3 may provide useful material.
Given the recurrent style of legal doc-
umentation, it is quite likely that the
user will be using many of the bilin-
gual text choices already aligned and
available in TM1 and TM3.
2. Once the source document has been com-
pleted, the system derives its particular
logical structure, which, with the aid of the
target DTD, is projected into the resulting
target logical structure.

Table 4 shows the number of words that make
up the segments stored in TM2 from the source
documents. There is a line for each document
size considered. We can see that the average
of segments contained in TM2 is 31.8%, on a
scale from 34.91% to only 3.01%. The amount
of segments dealt with in this way largely de-
pends on the size of the document. Short doc-
uments (90.21) have about 35% of their text
composed in this way. This figure goes down to
3% in documents larger than 1,000 words. This
is understandable, in the sense that the larger
the document, the smaller proportion of fixed
sections it will contain.
Table 5. shows the number of words that are
proposed for the target document. These trans-
lations are obtained from what is stored in TM2
complemented by algorithms designed to trans-
late dates and numbers. We can see that the

<bodyText confidence="0.999991864864865">
We have shown how DTDs derived from de-
scriptive markup can -be-employed to ease the
process of generating bilingual dedicated docu-
mentation. On average, one third of the con-
tents of thedocuments can be automatically ac-
counted for. It must also be pointed out that
the part being dealt with represents the core
structure, lay-out and logical components of the
text. The remaining two-thirds of untreated
document can still be managed with the aid
of sentence-oriented TMBS, filling in the gaps
in the overall skeleton provided by the target
template. Composers may also browse TM3 to
retrieve whole blocks for those parts which are
not determined by the DTD. One of the clear
targets for the future is to extend the cover-
age of the corpus and to test structural taggers
against other document types. A big challenge
we face is to develop tools that automatically
perform the recognition of documents from less
restricted and more open text types. However,
we are not sure of the extent of the practicality
of such an approach. An alternative direction
we are presently considering is to establish a
collection of pre-defined document types, which
would be validated by the institutional writers
themselves. It is a process currently being im-
plemented in the Basque administration to de-
fine document models for writers and transla-
tors to follow. What we have demonstrated is
that paired DTDs, complemented with rich lan-
guage resources of the kind defined in this pa-
per, allow for the design of optimal editing envi-
ronments which would combine both document
composition and translation as one single pro-
cess. All the resources needed (DTDs and TMs)
can be induced from an aligned corpus.

Abstract Extensively annotated bilingual parallel corpora can be exploited to feed editing tools that integrate the processes of document composition and translation. Here we discuss the architecture of an interactive editing tool that, on top of techniques common to most Translation Memory-based systems, applies the potential of SGML&apos;s DTDs to guide the process of bilingual document generation. Rather than employing just simple task-oriented mark-up, we selected a set of TEI&apos;s highly complex and versatile collection of tags to help disclose the underlying logical structure of documents in the test-corpus. DTDs were automatically induced and later integrated in the editing tool to provide the basic scheme for new documents.</abstract>

This is called the Document Type Definition (DTD) and it contains specifications for: * Names and content for all elements that are permitted to appear in a document. * Order in which these elements must appear. o Tag attributes with default values for those elements. DTDs have been abstracted away from the annotations that were automatically introduced in the corpus. Similar experiments have been reported before in the literature. (Ahonen, 1995) uses a method to build document instances from tagged texts that consists of a deterministic finite automaton for each context model. Subsequently, these automata are generalized and converted into regular expressions which are easily transcribed into SGML content models. (Shafer, 1995) combines document instances with simplification rules. Our method is similar to Shafer&apos;s, but with a. modification in the way rules reduce document instanCes. A tool to obtain a DTD for all document instances has been developed (Casillas, 1999). Given that source and target documents show some syntactic and st</context>

Furthermore, &lt;rs&gt; tagged segments inside &lt;segn&gt; records are simplified so that their content is dismissed and only the initial tag is kept (Lange et al., 1997). The reason is that they are considered variable elements within the segment (dates and numbers are also these type of elements). The strings Orden Foral of record 2 marked as &lt;rs type=law&gt; and Sala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo del Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Pais Vasco of record 3 &lt;rs type=organization&gt; are thus not included in record 1 &lt;seg9&gt;, since they may differ in other instantiations of the segment. These internal elements are largely proper names that vary from one instantiation of the segment to another. The &lt;rs&gt; tag can be considered to be the name of the varying element. </context>
