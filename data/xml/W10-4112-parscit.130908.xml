<bodyText confidence="0.9994924375">
We propose an effective approach to auto-
matically identify predicate heads in Chinese
sentences based on statistical pre-processing
and rule-based post-processing. In the pre-
processing stage, the maximal noun phrases in
a sentence are recognized and replaced by
“NP” labels to simplify the sentence structure.
Then a CRF model is trained to recognize the
predicate heads of this simplified sentence. In
the post-processing stage, a rule base is built
according to the grammatical features of
predicate heads. It is then utilized to correct
the preliminary recognition results. Experi-
mental results show that our approach is feasi-
ble and effective, and its accuracy achieves
89.14% on Tsinghua Chinese Treebank.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970690476191">
It is an important issue to identify predicates in
syntactic analysis. In general, a predicate is con-
sidered the head of a sentence. In Chinese, it
usually organizes two parts into a well-formed
sentence, one with a subject and its adjunct, and
the other with an object and/or complement (Luo
et al., 1994). Accurate identification of predicate
head is thus critical in determining the syntactic
structure of a sentence. Moreover, a predicate
head splitting a long sentence into two shorter
parts can alleviate the complexity of syntactic
analysis to a certain degree. This is particularly
useful when long dependency relations are in-
volved. Without doubt, this is also a difficult task
in Chinese dependency parsing (Cheng et al.,
2005).
Predicate head identification also plays an im-
portant role in facilitating various tasks of natural
language processing. For example, it enhances
shallow parsing (Sun et al., 2000) and head-
driven parsing (Collins, 1999), and also improves
the precision of sentence similarity computation
(Sui et al., 1998a). There is reason to expect it to
be more widely applicable to other tasks, e.g.
machine translation, information extraction, and
question answering.
In this paper, we propose an effective ap-
proach to automatically recognize predicate
heads of Chinese sentences based on a preproc-
essing step for maximal noun phrases 1(MNPs).
MNPs usually appear in the location of subject
and object in a sentence. The proper identifica-
tion of them is thus expected to assist the analy-
sis of sentence structure and/or improve the ac-
curacy of predicate head recognition.
In the next section, we will first review some
related works and discuss their limitations, fol-
lowed by a detailed description of the task of
recognizing predicate heads in Section 3. Section
4 illustrates our proposed approach and Section 5
presents experiments and results. Finally we
conclude the paper in Section 6.

There exist various approaches to identify predi-
cate heads in Chinese sentences. Luo and Zheng
(1994) and Tan (2000) presented two rule-based
methods based on contextual features and part of
speeches. A statistical approach was presented in
Sui and Yu (1998b), which utilizes a decision
tree model. Gong et al. (2003) presented their
hybrid method combining both rules and statis-
tics. These traditional approaches only make use
of the static and dynamic grammatical features of
the quasi-predicates to identify the predicate
heads. On this basis, Li and Meng (2005) pro-
posed a method to further utilize syntactic rela-
tions between the subject and the predicate in a
sentence. Besides the above monolingual pro-
posals, Sui and Yu (1998a) discussed a bilingual
strategy to recognize predicate heads in Chinese

sentences with reference to those in their coun-
terpart English sentences.
Nevertheless, these methods have their own
limitations. The rule-based methods require ef-
fective linguistic rules to be formulated by lin-
guists according to their own experience. Cer-
tainly, this is impossible to cover all linguistic
situations concerned, due to the complexity of
language and the limitations of human observa-
tion. In practice, we also should not underesti-
mate the complexity of feature application, the
computing power demanded and the difficulties
in handing irregular sentence patterns. For in-
stance, a sentence without subject may lead to an
incorrect recognition of predicate head. For cor-
pus-based approaches, they rely on language data
in huge size but the available data may not be
adequate. Those bilingual methods may first en-
counter the difficulty of determining correct sen-
tence alignment in the case that the parallel data
consist of much free translation.
Our method proposed here focuses on a simple
but effective means to help identify predicate
heads, i.e., MNP pre-processing. At present,
there has some substantial progress in automatic
recognition of MNP. Zhou et al. (2000) proposed
an efficient algorithm for identifying Chinese
MNPs by using their structure combination,
achieving an 85% precision and an 82% recall.
Dai et al. (2008) presented another method based
on statistics and rules, reaching a 90% F-score on
HIT Chinese Treebank. Jian et al. (2009) em-
ployed both left-right and right-left sequential
labeling and developed a novel “fork position”
based probabilistic algorithm to fuse bidirec-
tional results, obtaining an 86% F-score on the
Penn Chinese Treebank. Based on these previous
works, we have developed an approach that first
identifies the MNPs in a sentence, which are then
used in determining the predicate heads in the
next stage.

3 Task Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.947497466666667">
The challenge of accurate identification of predi-
cate heads is to resolve the problem of quasi-
predicate heads in a sentence. On the one hand,
the typical POSs of predicate heads in Chinese
sentences are verbs, adjectives and descriptive
words 2 . Each of them may have multiple in-
stances in a sentence. On the other hand, while a
simple sentence has only one predicate head, a
complex sentence may have multiple ones. The
2 We only focus on Verbs and adjectives in this work.
latter constitutes 8.25% in our corpus. Thus, the
real difficulty lies in how to recognize the true
predicate head of a sentence among so many
possibilities.
Take a simple sentence as example:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.48146875">
这 /rN 种 /qN 有 /v 特 大 /a 翅膀/n 的
/uJDE 大 /a 鸟 /n 没 有 /v 足 够 /aD 的
/uJDE 支 撑 /v 力 /n 和 /cC 前 进 /v 力
/n 。/wE
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.99814345">
The quasi-predicate heads (verbs and adjectives)
include 有/v, 特大/a, 大/a, 没有/v, 支撑/v,
and 前进/v. However, there are two MNPs in
this sentence, namely, “这/rN 种/qN 有/v 特大
/a 翅膀/n 的/uJDE 大/a 鸟/n” and “足够/aD
的/uJDE 支撑/v 力/n 和/cC 前进/v 力/n”.
These two MNPs cover most quasi-predicate
heads in the sentence, except 没有/v, the true
predicate head that we want.
An MNP is a complete semantic unit, and its
internal structure may include different kinds of
constituents (Jian et al., 2009). Therefore, the
fundamental structure of a sentence can be made
clear after recognizing its MNPs. This can help
filter out those wrong quasi-predicates for a bet-
ter shortlist of good candidates for the true predi-
cate head in a sentence.
In practice, the identification of predicate head
begins with recognizing MNPs in the same sen-
tence. It turns the above example sentence into:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9405555">
[ 这/rN 种/qN 有/v 特大/a 翅膀/n 的
/uJDE 大/a 鸟/n ] 没有/v [ 足够/aD
的/uJDE 支撑/v 力/n 和/cC 前进/v 力
/n ] 。/wE
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9541189">
These MNPs are then replaced with the conven-
tional label “NP” for noun phrase, resulting in a
simplified sentence structure as follows.
NP/NP 没有/v NP/NP 。/wE
This basic sentence structure can largely allevi-
ates the complexity of the original sentence and
narrows down the selection scope of quasi-
predicates for the true head. In this particular
example, the only verb left in the sentence after
MNP recognition is the true predicate head.

This section describes the process of identifying
predicate heads in sentences. As illustrated in
Figure 1 below, it can be divided into three steps:
Step 1: recognize the MNPs in a sentence and
replace the MNPs with “NP” label to simplify
the sentence structure.
Step 2: recognize the predicate heads in the
resulted simplified structure.
Step 3: post-process the preliminary results to
correct the wrong predicate heads according to
heuristics in a rule base.

The main effective factors for MNPs recogni-

of sentence in question. We analyze the length

that their average length is 6.24 words and the
longest length is 119 words. Table 2 presents this
distribution in detail.

After the MNPs in a sentence are recognized,
they are replaced by “NP” label to rebuild a sim-
plified sentence structure. It largely reduces the
difficulty in identifying predicate heads from this
simplified structure.

sentence as right_sentence if and only if all its

cluding those with multiple predicate heads.
For each predicate head, we need an appropri-

it improves the recognition accuracy, so as to
retrieve a validated rule base. The labeling of
predicate heads follows the standard of TCT and
a wrong labeling is treated as an error.
There are three main types of error, according
to our observation. The first is that no predicate

predicate head is recognized. The third is that the

Our experiments are carried out on the Tsinghua
Chinese Treebank (TCT). Every constituent of a
sentence in TCT is labeled by human expert. We
randomly extract 5000 sentences from TCT and
remove those sentences that do not have predi-
cate head. Finally, our data set contains 4613
sentences, in which 3711 sentences are randomly
chosen as training data and 902 sentences as test-
ing data. The average length of these sentences
in training set is 20 words.
The number of quasi-predicate heads in a sen-
tence is a critical factor to determine the per-
formance of predicate head recognition. Reduc-
ing the number of quasi-predicate heads can im-
prove the recognition precision. Table 5 shows
the percentage of quasi-predicate heads in train-

From Table 5, we can see that almost half sen-
tences contain more than three quasi-predicate
heads. Only 12.5% of sentences have only one
quasi-predicate head before MNP replacement.
However, after MNPs are replaced with the “NP”
label, only 10.72% contain more than three
quasi-predicate heads and nearly 50% contain
only one quasi-predicate head. We have evidence
that MNP pre-processing can reduce the number

For comparison purpose, we developed four dif-
ferent models for predicate head recognition.
Models 1 and 2 are CRF models, the former rec-
ognizing predicate heads directly and the later
recognizing MNPs at the same time. Model 3
recognizes predicate heads based on MNP pre-
processing. Model 4 is based on model 3, includ-
ing the post-processing stage. Table 6 shows the
recognition performance of each model using the
best context window size.

Comparing these models, we can see that the
additional feature in model 2 leads to 1% im-
provement in precision over model 1. Moreover,
the MNP pre-processing in model 3 results in a
large increase in accuracy, compared to model 1.
It indicates that the MNP pre-processing does
improve the precision of recognition. Compared
with model 3, model 4 achieves a precision even
6.55% higher, indicating that the post-processing
is also an effective step for recognition.
As shown, the performance is affected by the
effect of MNP recognition. There are three kinds
of relation between the predicate heads and the
types of MNP recognition error:
Relation 1: The whole sentence is recognized
as an MNP.
Relation 2: The boundaries of an MNP are in-
correctly recognized and the MNP does not con-
tain the predicate head.
Relation 3: The boundaries of an MNP are in-
correctly recognized and the MNP contains the
predicate head. Table 7 shows the distribution of
these three relations in the recognition errors.
In our approach, the errors of relation 1 and
relation 3 can be solved by the post-processing,
as presented in Section 4.3. Relation 2 holds the
largest proportion among the three. But the error
rate of predicate head recognition only reaches
31.67% in this case. That is to say, although the
MNP boundaries are incorrectly recognized, the
accuracy of predicate head recognition can still
reach 68.33%.
Chen (2007) proposed a probabilistic model
(model 5) for recognizing predicate heads in Chi-
nese sentences. The probabilities of quasi-
predicates are estimated by maximum likelihood
estimation. A discounted model is used to
smooth parameters. We compare his model with
our model 3 using different contextual features
on TCT corpus. Table 8 shows the comparison
results.
The highest precision of model 3 is 82.59%
when the context window size is set to 3. For
model 5, it is 70.62% at a context window size of
4. Experimental results show that the precision of
our method is about 12% higher than Chen’s.

Beside Chen’s method, the Stanford Parser
can also recognize the predicate heads in simple
Chinese sentences. The root node of dependency
tree is the predicate head. For a comparison, we

our model 3. We also train a model of predicate
head recognition (model 6), which assumes that
all MNPs are successfully identified. The com-
parison is shown in Table 9. We can see that the
precision of model 6 is 8.35% higher than model
3. This means that our method still has a certain
room for further improvement.

<bodyText confidence="0.995431">
As shown above, the post-processing can correct
most errors in the recognition of predicate heads.
But we also observe some errors that cannot be
corrected this way. For example,
地理学/n以/p 描述性/n 记载/v [ 地理/n
知识/n ] 为主/v 。/wE
The predicate head here is “为主”, but usually
“记载” is recognized as the predicate head. This
is because “记载” can be used either as a verb or
a noun. There are many verbs of this kind in Chi-
nese, such as “ 主 张 ” and “应 用 ”. Mistakes
caused by the flexibility of Chinese verb and the
ambiguity of sentence structure appear to deserve
more of our effort. Meanwhile, there are also
some other unusual cases that cannot be properly
solved with statistical methods.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970235294118">
Identification of predicate heads is important to
syntactic parsing. In this paper, we have pre-
sented a novel method that combines both statis-
tical and rule-based approaches to identify predi-
cate heads based on MNP pre-processing and
rule-based post-processing. We have had a series
of experiments to show that this method achieves
a significant improvement over some state-of-
the-art approaches. Furthermore, it also provides
a simple structure of sentence that can be utilized
for parsing.
In the future, we will study how semantic in-
formation can be applied to further improve the
precision of MNP recognition and predicate head
identification. It is also very interesting to ex-
plore how this approach can facilitate parsing,
including shallow parsing.

<abstract confidence="0.982522117647059">We propose an effective approach to automatically identify predicate heads in Chinese sentences based on statistical pre-processing and rule-based post-processing. In the preprocessing stage, the maximal noun phrases in a sentence are recognized and replaced by “NP” labels to simplify the sentence structure. Then a CRF model is trained to recognize the predicate heads of this simplified sentence. In the post-processing stage, a rule base is built according to the grammatical features of predicate heads. It is then utilized to correct the preliminary recognition results. Experimental results show that our approach is feasible and effective, and its accuracy achieves 89.14% on Tsinghua Chinese Treebank.</abstract>

Relation 3: The boundaries of an MNP are incorrectly recognized and the MNP contains the predicate head. Table 7 shows the distribution of these three relations in the recognition errors. In our approach, the errors of relation 1 and relation 3 can be solved by the post-processing, as presented in Section 4.3. Relation 2 holds the largest proportion among the three. But the error rate of predicate head recognition only reaches 31.67% in this case. That is to say, although the MNP boundaries are incorrectly recognized, the accuracy of predicate head recognition can still reach 68.33%. Chen (2007) proposed a probabilistic model (model 5) for recognizing predicate heads in Chinese sentences. The probabilities of quasipredicates are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation. A discounted model is used to smooth parameters. We compare his model with our model 3 using different contextual features on TCT corpus. Table 8 shows the comparison results. The highest precision of model 3 is 82.59% when the context window size is set to 3. For model 5, it is 70.62% at a context window size of 4. Experimental results show that the precision of our method is about 12% higher than Chen’s. Context w</context>

In Chinese, it usually organizes two parts into a well-formed sentence, one with a subject and its adjunct, and the other with an object and/or complement (Luo et al., 1994). Accurate identification of predicate head is thus critical in determining the syntactic structure of a sentence. Moreover, a predicate head splitting a long sentence into two shorter parts can alleviate the complexity of syntactic analysis to a certain degree. This is particularly useful when long dependency relations are involved. Without doubt, this is also a difficult task in Chinese dependency parsing (Cheng et al., 2005). Predicate head identification also plays an important role in facilitating various tasks of natural language processing. For example, it enhances shallow parsing (Sun et al., 2000) and headdriven parsing (Collins, 1999), and also improves the precision of sentence similarity computation (Sui et al., 1998a). There is reason to expect it to be more widely applicable to other tasks, e.g. machine translation, information extraction, and question answering.

As illustrated in Figure 1 below, it can be divided into three steps: Step 1: recognize the MNPs in a sentence and replace the MNPs with “NP” label to simplify the sentence structure. Step 2: recognize the predicate heads in the resulted simplified structure. Step 3: post-process the preliminary results to correct the wrong predicate heads according to heuristics in a rule base. 4.1 MNP Recognition The MNP recognition is performed via a trained CRF model on unlabeled data. We adopt the method in Dai et al. (2008), with modified templates for the different corpus. Each feature is composed of the words and POS tags surrounding the current word i, as well as different combination of them. The context window of template is set to size 3. Table 1 shows the feature template we use.
