This paper presents an extension to the
Reference Domain Theory (Salmon-Alt,
2001) in order to solve plural references.
While this theory doesn’t take plural
reference into account in its original
form, this paper shows how several
entities can be grouped together by
building a new domain and how they can
be accessed later on. We introduce the
notion of super-domain, representing the
access structure to all the plural referents
of a given type.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999551366666667">
In the course of a discourse or a dialogue,
referents introduced separately could be
referenced with a single plural expression
(pronoun, demonstratives, etc.). The grouping of
these referents may depend on many factors: it
may be explicit if they were syntactically
coordinated or juxtaposed or implicit if they just
share common semantic features (Eschenbach et
al., 1989). Time is also an important factor while
it may be difficult to group old mentioned
referents with new ones. Because of this
multiplicity of factors, choosing the right
discursive grouping for a referential plural
expression is ambiguous, and this ambiguity
needs to be explicitly described.
We present a model of grouping based on
reference domains theory (Salmon-Alt, 2001)
that considers that a reference operation consists
of extracting a referent in a domain. However the
original theory barely takes into account plural
reference. This paper shows how several entities
can be grouped together by building a new
domain and how they can be accessed later on. It
introduces also the notion of super-domain D+
that represents the access structure to all the
plural referents of type D. This work is currently
being implemented and evaluated in the MEDIA
project of the EVALDA framework, a national
french understanding evaluation campaign
(Devillers, 2004).

2 Groupings of Referents
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999596181818182">
Several kinds of clues can specify that referents
should be grouped together, or at least could be
grouped together. These clues may occur at
several language levels, from the noun phrase
level to the rhetorical structure level. We have
not explored in detail the different ways of
groupings entities together in a discourse or
dialogue. What is described here are just some of
the phenomenon we got confronted with while
developing a reference resolution module for a
dialogue understanding system.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.898476772727273">
■ Explicit Coordination - The most basic
way to explicitly express the grouping of two
or more referents is using a connector such as
and, or, as well as, etc.
“Good afternoon, I would like to book a
single room and a double room”
■ Implicit Sentential Coordination - An
implicit coordination occurs when two or
more referents of the same kind are present in
one sentence, without explicit connector
between them. “Does the hotel de la gare
have a restaurant, like the Holiday Inn?”
■ Implicit Discursive Coordination –
Such a coordination occurs when several
reference are evoked in separate sentences.
The grouping must be done based on
rhetorical structuring. Here we consider short
pieces of dialogue, admitting only one level
of implicit discursive coordination. “I would
like an hotel close to the sea... I also need an
hotel downtown... And the hotels have to
accept dogs.”

3 Reference Domain Theory
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99932194">
We are willing to try a pragmatic approach to
reference resolution in practical multimodal
dialogues (Gieselman, 2004). For example we
need to process frequent phenomena like
ordinals for choosing in a list (discursive, or
visual) or otherness when re-evoking old
referents. Hence keeping the track of the way the
context is modified when introducing a referent
or referring, is mandatory. The Reference
Domains Theory (Salmon-Alt, 2001) supposes
that every act of reference is related to a certain
domain of interpretation. It endorses the
cognitive grammar concept of domain, defined
as a cognitive structure presupposed by the
semantics of the expression (Kumar et al., 2003).
In other words, a referring expression has to be
interpreted in a given domain, highlighting and
specifying a particular referent in this domain. A
reference domain is composed of a group of
entities in the hearer’s memory which can be
discursive referents, visual objects, or concepts.
It describes how each entity could be addressed
through a referential expression.
This theory views the referring process as a
dynamic extraction of a referent in a domain
instead of a binding between two entities
(Salmon-Alt, 2000). Hence doing a reference act
consists in isolating a particular entity from other
rejected candidates, amongst all the accessible
entities composing the domain (Olson, 1970).
This dynamic discrimination relies on projecting
an access structure focusing the referent in the
domain. The domain then becomes salient for
further interpretations. The preferences for
choosing a suitable domain are inspired from the
Relevance theory (Sperber &amp; Wilson, 1986)
taking into account such focalization and
salience.
Landragin &amp; Romary (2003) have also studied
the usage of reference domains in order to model
a visual scene. The grouping factors for visual
objects are those given by the Gestalt theory,
proximity, similarity, and good continuation.
Each perceptual groups or groups designated by
a gesture could be the base domain for an
extraction. Referential expressions work the
same way either the domains are discursive,
perceptual or gestural, they extract and highlight
referents in these domains. See (Landragin et al.,
2001) for a review of perceptual groupings.

A referential domain is defined by:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996670833333333">
• a set of entities accessible through this
domain (ground of domain),
• a description subsuming the description
of all these entities (type of domain),
• a set of access structures to these
entities.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990337142857143">
For instance: “the Ibis hotel (h1) and the hotel
Lafayette (h2)” forms a referential domain,
whose type would be Hotel, and whose
accessible entities would be h1 and h2,
themselves defined as domains of type Hotel.
These two hotels could be accessed later on by
their names.

4.1 Access structures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995839666666666">
We suppose that the distinction between the
referents from the excluded alternatives requires
highlighting a discrimination criterion opposing
them. This criterion behaves like a partition of
the accessible entities, grouping them together
according to their similarities and their
differences. A partition may have one of its parts
focused. There are, at least, three kinds of
discrimination criteria:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.823008666666667">
• discrimination on description. Entities
can be discriminated by their type, their
properties, or by the relations they have with
other entities. For example the name of the
hotels is a discrimination criterion in “the Ibis
hotel and the hotel Lafayette”.
• discrimination on focus. Entities can
also be discriminated by the focus they have
when they are mentioned in the discourse or
designed by a gesture. For example, “this
room” would select a focused referent in a
domain, whereas “the other room” would
select a non-focused one.
• discrimination on time of occurrence.
Entities can finally be discriminated by their
occurrence in the discourse. For example “the
second hotel” would discriminate this hotel
by its rank in the domain.

<bodyText confidence="0.9965385">

ordered along their recentness (the referential

space). The resolution algorithm consists of two
phases:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.4392675">
1. Searching a suitable, preferred domain in
the referential space when interpreting a
referring expression. The suitability is
defined by the minimal conditions the domain
has to conform to in order to be the base of an
interpretation (particular description, or
presence of a particular access structure with
focus or not). The main preference factor is
the minimization of the access cost
(recentness or salience), however other
criteria like thematic structure could be taken
into account and will be future work. Each
domain is tested according to the constraints
given by the referential expression. We allow
several layers of constraints for each type of
expression : if the stronger constraints are not
met, then weaker constraints are tried.
2. Extracting a referent and restructuring the
referential space, taking into account this
extraction. It not only focuses the referent in
its domain, but also moves the domain itself
to a more recent place. When one referent
acquires the focus, the alternative members
of the same partition loose it.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999804375">
This generic scheme is instantiated for each type
of access modes (a modality plus an expression).
For example a definite “the N” will search for a
domain in which a particular entity of type “N”
can be discriminated, and the restructuring
consists in focalizing in this domain the referent
found. See (Landragin &amp; Romary, 2003) for a
description of the different access modes.
The algorithm highlights the two types of
ambiguities, domain or referent ambiguities,
which occur when there is no preference
available to make a choice between multiples
entities in the first or the second phase. We guess
that natural ambiguities should eventually be
solved through the dialogue between the agents
of the communication.

5 Super-Domains
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998898">
In order to take groupings into account in the
Reference Domains Theory, we introduce two
constructs in our formal toolbox. Indeed, having
only one kind of domain construct doesn’t allow
for a correct distinction between different
referent statuses.
First we distinguish plural and simple domains.
The simple domains D serve as bases for
profiling, or highlighting, a subpart, or related
part of a simple referent. For instance, if D =
Room, then one can profile a Price from D. The
plural domains D* serve as either as a generic
base or as a plural representative for profiling
a simple domain D. A generic base is mandatory
in our model to support the insertion of new
extra-linguistic referents evoked with an
indefinite construct (for instance “I saw a black
bird on the roof”), while plural representatives
are used for explicit groupings. A domain D*1
can also be profiled from a D*0, provided D*1
profiles a subset of the elements of D*0.
Second, we introduce the notion of super-
domain D+, from which a D* can be profiled.
The relations allowed between domains are
represented on figure 1. A super-domain D+ is
the domain of all groupings D*, including a
special D*all grouping which is the representative
of all evoked instances of a given category. This
configuration is not intended to deal with long
dialogues where several, trans-sentential
groupings occur, and where older groupings may
become out of access. Doing this would require
a rhetorically driven structuring of the D*all.

<bodyText confidence="0.95899347826087">
As Reference Domain Theory is primarily
targeted toward extra-linguistic referents
occurring in practical dialogue, the construction
of the domain trees, representing the supposed
structuring of referents accessibility, is based on
ontology. As a consequence, for each “natural”
type and each subtype (for instance
Room∧Single), a domain tree is potentially
created (actually, one can easily imagine how
this creation may be driven ‘on-demand’).
Another evolution from the initial Reference
Domain Theory is the possibility to focalize
several items of a partition. Indeed, since the
resolution algorithm can focalize a whole plural
domain, all elements of this domain must be
focalized in all the plural domains they occur in.
In order to refer to plural entities the idea is to
build plural domains dynamically : when some
sentence-level grouping, either implicit or
explicit occurs or when a plural extra-linguistic
referent is evoked, a D* is created and focussed
D+
: gives access to

<bodyText confidence="0.996545777777778">
in D+, with each of its components as children,
when possible (that is, when each component is
described). When new extra-linguistic referents
(singular or plural) are evoked, they are
individually profiled under the D*all
corresponding to their types (that is, their
“natural” type, and all the subtypes they are
eligible to).
In short, for all referents of type D:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992612833333333">
• they become subdomains of D*all
• if they are plural referents, they also build
up a focalized subdomain of D+
• all the referents of a given type are then
grouped together under a new focalized
subdomain of D+.

is retrieved.
One can see that Hotel*all is inaccessible by a
generic expression like a demonstrative without
modifiers but only by a special expression like
&amp;quot;all the hotels&amp;quot;. In our point of view, the reason
is that the grouping Hotel*1 lowers the salience
of Hotel*all.

6 Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999412377777778">
We used description logics for modelling
domains and domain-reasoning. One has to deal
with plural entities and can follow (Franconi, 93)
by using collection theory, representing
collections as individuals and membership by a
role (plus plural quantifiers). But we should use
another way considering that the inference
engine we use, Racer (Haarslev and Möller, 03),
does not take into account ALCS. Hence we
tried representing the domains by concepts,
given their semantic are set of individuals. The
domain D+ corresponds to the concept D, and
the domain-subdomain relation is a
subsumption. All basic manipulation with
domains could be done using Tbox assertions.
Additionnally, a partition structure is simply a
sequence of subdomains which are different
from each other (disjoint concepts) and whose
elements could be focussed. The algorithm goes
through the referential space and tests each
domain in the recency order against the
constraints given by the referential expression.
Conceptual tests on the description and
partitional tests on the focus or possible
discriminations are made to retrieve the domain
and the referent. If none are found, they may be
created by accomodation. Groupings are created
only for explicit coordinations, implicit
sentential coordinations (two referents could be
grouped if they have the same basic type) and
some kind of specifications.
Domains and groupings creation entails the
creation of new concepts in the Tbox. Each
concept insertion requires a costly
reclassification, therefore we preferred an
approximation considering only that new
groupings assert primitive concepts. Other
domains are concept terms i.e. descriptions
which do not have to be asserted in the Tbox
automatically.
Implicit discursive groupings are not
implemented considering the need of a rhetorical
structure (like in SDRT, Asher 93) or a mental
space model. The following example shows the
needs :
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.570181">
U1 : I would like an hotel (h1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.926260285714286">
S1 : I propose you the hotel Ibis (h2) and
the Lafayette hotel (h3).
Hotel h1 could very hardly be grouped with h2
and h3, even by “all these hotels” (or maybe by a
third speaker). We guess among other factors
that they belong to different levels of
interpretation, h1 in the domain of the desires of
</bodyText>

57
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966583333333">
the user, and the others in the domain of existing
hotels. The link between the two domains is
possible if one knows that S1 is an answer of to
U&apos;s request. Such discrimination criterion and
high level domains are not yet implemented.
Instead we concentrated on extra-linguistic
referents which are assumed to be interpreted in
the real/system world (like hotels, rooms). We
are currently testing the approach to see if it
could be extended to any type of entities
provided accurate discrimination criteria (like
the predication).

7 Example
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941833333333">
A sample dialogue (table 1) is analyzed through
the preceding algorithm. This example shows
how the referents introduced in an explicit
coordination could be referenced as a whole “the
two hotels”, or extracted discriminately by an
ordinal “the second one” or by an otherness
expression “the other one”. All the subdomains
of H+ (i.e. the plural domains of hotels) are
indicated after each interpretation using a
simplified notation. Only the ordered list of
accessible entities and their focalization (bold)
are noted for each subdomain. For instance
H*all= (h1, h2, h3) means that the domain H*all is
focalized in H+, and that h3 is focalized in H*all.
In order to interpret U1, U2 or U3 one needs to
rely on the previous structuring of H+. In U1, the
previously focalized domain H*1 is preferred to
be the base for interpreting “the second one”
because of the order discrimination. This leads
to extracting h1 hence focalizing it in H*1 but
also in H*0 and in H*all. In U2, H*1 cannot be the
base for interpreting “the third one” because no
entity could be discriminate this way. Therefore
the only suitable domain is H*all. It is also
impossible to interpret U3 : “the other one” in
H*1 because of the lack of a focus discrimination
between h1 and h2.
It is however possible to choose H*all for the
domain of interpretation: the excluded referents
h1 and h2 are unfocused while h3 gains focus.

<bodyText confidence="0.999967347826087">
This work is currently being evaluated in the
MEDIA/EVALDA framework, a national
understanding evaluation campaign. (Devillers et
al., 04). It aims to evaluate the semantic and
referential abilities of systems with various
approaches of natural language processing. The
results of each system are compared to manually
annotated utterances transcribed from a Woz
corpus in a hotel reservation task. For the
referential facet, referential expressions
(excluding indefinites, and proper names) are
annotated by a semantic description of their
referents.
Our system which relies on a symbolic approach
using deep parsing and description logics for
semantic currently scores 64% (f-measure) for
identifying and describing accurately the
referents. We guess that such evaluation will be
an occasion for us to test different hypothesis on
reference resolution using domains (for exemple
different criteria for grouping). However we do
not have yet more precise results on plurals and
ordinals specifically.

The extension we made to the Reference
Domains Theory is still limited because it
considers only extra-linguistic referents, i.e.
those also having an existence outside discourse.
In addition the trans-sentential groupings are not
fully studied yet. We guess that such groupings
should need a rhetorical description of the
discourse or dialogue. In spite of its limits, the
extension can render dynamic effects allowing
ordinals and otherness in plural contexts. An

While this theory doesn’t take plural reference into account in its original form, this paper shows how several entities can be grouped together by building a new domain and how they can be accessed later on.

We introduce the notion of super-domain, representing the access structure to all the plural referents of a given type. 1 Introduction In the course of a discourse or a dialogue, referents introduced separately could be referenced with a single plural expression (pronoun, demonstratives, etc.). The grouping of these referents may depend on many factors: it may be explicit if they were syntactically coordinated or juxtaposed or implicit if they just share common semantic features (Eschenbach et al., 1989). Time is also an important factor while it may be difficult to group old mentioned referents with new ones. Because of this multiplicity of factors, choosing the right discursive grouping for a referential plural expression is ambiguous, and this ambiguity needs to be explicitly described. We present a model of grouping based on reference domains theory (Salmon-Alt, 2001) that considers that a reference operation consists of extracting a referent in a domain. However the original theory barely takes into account plural reference. This paper shows how several entities can be grouped together b</context>

For example we need to process frequent phenomena like ordinals for choosing in a list (discursive, or visual) or otherness when re-evoking old referents. Hence keeping the track of the way the context is modified when introducing a referent or referring, is mandatory. The Reference Domains Theory (Salmon-Alt, 2001) supposes that every act of reference is related to a certain domain of interpretation. It endorses the cognitive grammar concept of domain, defined as a cognitive structure presupposed by the semantics of the expression (Kumar et al., 2003). In other words, a referring expression has to be interpreted in a given domain, highlighting and specifying a particular referent in this domain. A reference domain is composed of a group of entities in the hearer’s memory which can be discursive referents, visual objects, or concepts. It describes how each entity could be addressed through a referential expression. This theory views the referring process as a dynamic extraction of a referent in a domain instead of a binding between two entities (Salmon-Alt, 2000).

This dynamic discrimination relies on projecting an access structure focusing the referent in the domain. The domain then becomes salient for further interpretations. The preferences for choosing a suitable domain are inspired from the Relevance theory (Sperber &amp; Wilson, 1986) taking into account such focalization and salience.

It not only focuses the referent in its domain, but also moves the domain itself to a more recent place. When one referent acquires the focus, the alternative members of the same partition loose it. This generic scheme is instantiated for each type of access modes (a modality plus an expression). For example a definite “the N” will search for a domain in which a particular entity of type “N” can be discriminated, and the restructuring consists in focalizing in this domain the referent found. See (Landragin &amp; Romary, 2003) for a description of the different access modes. The algorithm highlights the two types of ambiguities, domain or referent ambiguities, which occur when there is no preference available to make a choice between multiples entities in the first or the second phase. We guess that natural ambiguities should eventually be solved through the dialogue between the agents of the communication. 5 Super-Domains In order to take groupings into account in the Reference Domains Theory, we introduce two constructs in our formal toolbox.
