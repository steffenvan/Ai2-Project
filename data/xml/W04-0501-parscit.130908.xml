Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936052631579">
Over the last three decades, the development of
restricted domain applications has been an ongo-
ing theme in computational linguistic research.
Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Sum-
marization, and Question Answering researchers
have all built at one time or another restricted
domain systems. In retrospect, it is long due to
examine both the successes and failures of these
previous attempts.
In this talk, I will examine the circumstances
in which the development of restricted domain
applications has led to significant advances in the
state of the art and the circumstances in which
restricted domain research has had little impact
on our field. I will use the lessons learned from
previous attempts to building restricted domain
natural language processing applications in order
to examine the potential impact of current re-
search in restricted domain question answering.
