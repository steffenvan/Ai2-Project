This paper studies issues related to the
compilation of a bilingual lexicon for tech-
nical terms. In the task of estimating bilin-
gual term correspondences of technical
terms, it is usually rather difficult to find
an existing corpus for the domain of such
technical terms. In this paper, we adopt
an approach of collecting a corpus for the
domain of such technical terms from the
Web. As a method of translation esti-
mation for technical terms, we employ a
compositional translation estimation tech-
nique. This paper focuses on quantita-
tively comparing variations of the compo-
nents in the scoring functions of composi-
tional translation estimation. Through ex-
perimental evaluation, we show that the
domain/topic-specific corpus contributes
toward improving the performance of the
compositional translation estimation.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999875173076923">
This paper studies issues related to the compilation
of a bilingual lexicon for technical terms. Thus
far, several techniques of estimating bilingual term
correspondences from a parallel/comparable cor-
pus have been studied (Matsumoto and Utsuro,
2000). For example, in the case of estimation from
comparable corpora, (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp,
1999) proposed standard techniques of estimating
bilingual term correspondences from comparable
corpora. In their techniques, contextual similarity
between a source language term and its translation
candidate is measured across the languages, and
all the translation candidates are re-ranked accord-
ing to their contextual similarities. However, there
are limited number of parallel/comparable corpora
that are available for the purpose of estimating
bilingual term correspondences. Therefore, even
if one wants to apply those existing techniques to
the task of estimating bilingual term correspon-
dences of technical terms, it is usually rather dif-
ficult to find an existing corpus for the domain of
such technical terms.
On the other hand, compositional translation es-
timation techniques that use a monolingual corpus
(Fujii and Ishikawa, 2001; Tanaka and Baldwin,
2003) are more practical. It is because collecting a
monolingual corpus is less expensive than collect-
ing a parallel/comparable corpus. Translation can-
didates of a term can be compositionally generated
by concatenating the translation of the constituents
of the term. Here, the generated translation candi-
dates are validated using the domain/topic-specific
corpus.
In order to assess the applicability of the com-
positional translation estimation technique, we
randomly pick up 667 Japanese and English tech-
nical term translation pairs of 10 domains from ex-
isting technical term bilingual lexicons. We then
manually examine their compositionality, and find
out that 88% of them are actually compositional,
which is a very encouraging result.
But still, it is expensive to collect a
domain/topic-specific corpus. Here, we adopt
an approach of using the Web, since documents
of various domains/topics are available on the
Web. When validating translation candidates
using the Web, roughly speaking, there exist the
following two approaches. In the first approach,
translation candidates are validated through
the search engine (Cao and Li, 2002). In the
second approach, a domain/topic-specific corpus
is collected from the Web in advance and fixed

before translation estimation, then generated
translation candidates are validated against the
domain/topic-specific corpus (Tonoike et al.,
2005). The first approach is preferable in terms of
coverage, while the second is preferable in terms
of computational efficiency. This paper mainly
focuses on quantitatively comparing the two
approaches in terms of coverage and precision of
compositional translation estimation.
More specifically, in compositional translation
estimation, we decompose the scoring function
of a translation candidate into two components:
bilingual lexicon score and corpus score. In this
paper, we examine variants for those components
and define 9 types of scoring functions in total.
Regarding the above mentioned two approaches
to validating translation candidates using the Web,
the experimental result shows that the second
approach outperforms the first when the correct
translation does exist in the corpus. Furthermore,
we examine the methods that combine two scor-
ing functions based on their agreement. The ex-
perimental result shows that it is quite possible to
achieve precision much higher than those of single
scoring functions.

2 Overall framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990306122449">
The overall framework of compiling a bilingual
lexicon from the Web is illustrated as in Figure 1.
Suppose that we have sample terms of a specific
domain/topic, then the technical terms that are to
be listed as the headwords of a bilingual lexicon
are collected from the Web by the related term col-
lection method of (Sato and Sasaki, 2003). These
collected technical terms can be divided into three
subsets depending on the number of translation
candidates present in an existing bilingual lexicon,
i.e., the subset Xs of terms for which the number
of translations in the existing bilingual lexicon is
one, the subset Xs of terms for which the number
of translations is more than one, and the subset YS
of terms that are not found in the existing bilingual
lexicon (henceforth, the union Xs ∪ Xs will be
denoted as XS). Here, the translation estimation
task here is to estimate translations for the terms
of the subsets Xs and YS. A new bilingual lex-
icon is compiled from the result of the translation
estimation for the terms of the subsets Xs and
YS as well as the translation pairs that consist of
the terms of the subset Xs and their translations
found in the existing bilingual lexicon.
For the terms of the subset Xs , it is required
that an appropriate translation is selected from
among the translation candidates found in the ex-
isting bilingual lexicon. For example, as a trans-
lation of the Japanese technical term “レジスタ,”
which belongs to the logic circuit domain, the term
“register” should be selected but not the term “reg-
ista” of the football domain. On the other hand, for
the terms of YS, it is required that the translation
candidates are generated and validated. In this pa-
per, out of the above two tasks, we focus on the
latter of translation candidate generation and val-
idation using the Web. As we introduced in the
previous section, here we experimentally compare
the two approaches to validating translation candi-
dates. The first approach directly uses the search
engine, while the second uses the domain/topic-
specific corpus, which is collected in advance from
the Web. Here, in the second approach, we use the
term of Xs , which has only one translation in the
existing bilingual lexicon. The set of translations
of the terms of the subset Xs is denoted as XT .
Then, in the second approach, the domain/topic-
specific corpus is collected from the Web using the
terms of the set XT .

that documents that describe the technical term xU�
are ranked high. For example, an online glossary
is one such document. When collecting a Japanese
corpus, the search engine “goo”2 is used. The spe-
cific queries that are used in this search engine
are phrases with topic-marking postpositional par-
ticles such as “xU� とは,” “xU� という,” “xU� 1&apos;”
and an adnominal phrase “4 の,” and “xU�.” Y

the existing bilingual lexicon Eijiro. The under-
lying idea of augmenting the existing bilingual
lexicon with bilingual constituents lexicons is il-
lustrated in Figure 3. Suppose that the existing
bilingual lexicon does not include the translation
pair “applied : 応用,” while it includes many
compound translation pairs with the first English
word “applied” and the first Japanese word “応
用.”3 In such a case, we align those translation
pairs and estimate a bilingual constituent transla-
tion pair which is to be collected into a bilingual
constituents lexicon.
More specifically, from the existing bilingual
lexicon, we first collect translation pairs whose
English terms and Japanese terms consist of two
constituents into another lexicon P2. We com-
pile the “bilingual constituents lexicon (prefix)”
from the first constituents of the translation pairs
in P2 and compile the “bilingual constituents lex-
icon (suffix)” from their second constituents. The
number of entries in each language and those of
the translation pairs in these lexicons are shown in
Table 1.
The result of our assessment reveals that only
48% of the 667 translation pairs mentioned in Sec-
tion 1 can be compositionally generated by using
Eijiro, while the rate increases up to 69% using
both Eijiro and “bilingual constituents lexicons.”4

In our experimental evaluation, within the frame-

cal terms, we evaluate the translation estimation
portion that is indicated by the bold line in Fig-
ure 4. In this paper, we simply omit the evalua-
tion of the process of collecting technical terms to
be listed as the headwords of a bilingual lexicon.
In order to evaluate the translation estimation por-
tion, terms are randomly selected from the 10 cate-
gories of existing Japanese-English technical term
dictionaries listed in Table 3, for each of the sub-
sets XUS and YS (here, the terms of YS that consist
of only one word or morpheme are excluded). As
described in Section 1, the terms of the set XUT (the
set of translations for the terms of the subsetXUS )
is used for collecting a domain/topic-specific cor-
pus from the Web. As shown in Table 3, size of the
collected corpora is 48MB on the average. Trans-
lation estimation evaluation is to be conducted for
the subset YS. For each of the 10 categories, Ta-
ble 3 shows the sizes of the subsets XUS and YS,
and the rate of including correct translation within
the collected domain/topic-specific corpus for YS.
In the following, we show the evaluation results

column ‘top 1’ shows the correct rate of the first
ranked translation candidate. The column ‘top 10’
shows the rate of including the correct candidate
within top 10.
First, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of
the approach of validating translation candidates
by using a target language corpus, we compare the
scoring functions ’D’ and ’E’. The difference be-
tween them is whether or not they use a corpus
score. The results for the whole set YS show that
using a corpus score, the precision improves from
33.9% to 43.0%. This result supports the effec-
tiveness of the approach of validating translation
candidates using a target language corpus.
As can be seen from these results for the whole
set YS, the correct rate of the scoring function ‘I’
that directly uses the web search engine in the cal-
culation of its corpus score is higher than those
of other scoring functions that use the collected
domain/topic-specific corpus. This is because,
for the whole set YS, the rate of including cor-
rect translation within the collected domain/topic-
specific corpus is 72% on the average, which is
not very high. On the other hand, the results of the
column ‘gene.-exist’ show that if the correct trans-
lation does exist in the corpus, most of the scor-
ing functions other than ‘I’ can achieve precisions
higher than that of the scoring function ‘I’. This
result supports the effectiveness of the approach
of collecting a domain/topic-specific corpus from
the Web in advance and then validating generated
translation candidates against this corpus.

As a related work, (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2001) pro-
posed a technique for compositional estimation of
bilingual term correspondences for the purpose of
cross-language information retrieval. One of the
major differences between the technique of (Fu-
jii and Ishikawa, 2001) and the one proposed in
this paper is that in (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2001), in-
stead of a domain/topic-specific corpus, they use a
corpus containing the collection of technical pa-
pers, each of which is published by one of the
65 Japanese associations for various technical do-
mains. Another significant difference is that in
(Fujii and Ishikawa, 2001), they evaluate only the
performance of the cross-language information re-
trieval and not that of translation estimation.
(Cao and Li, 2002) also proposed a method
of compositional translation estimation for com-
pounds. In the method of (Cao and Li, 2002), the
translation candidates of a term are composition-
ally generated by concatenating the translation of
the constituents of the term and are validated di-
rectly through the search engine. In this paper,
we evaluate the approach proposed in (Cao and

This paper studied issues related to the compila-
tion a bilingual lexicon for technical terms. In
the task of estimating bilingual term correspon-
dences of technical terms, it is usually rather dif-
ficult to find an existing corpus for the domain
of such technical terms. In this paper, we adopt
an approach of collecting a corpus for the do-
main of such technical terms from the Web. As
a method of translation estimation for technical
terms, we employed a compositional translation
estimation technique. This paper focused on quan-
titatively comparing variations of the components
in the scoring functions of compositional transla-
tion estimation. Through experimental evaluation,
we showed that the domain/topic specific corpus
contributes to improving the performance of the
compositional translation estimation.
Future work includes complementally integrat-
ing the proposed framework of compositional
translation estimation using the Web with other
translation estimation techniques. One of them is
that based on collecting partially bilingual texts
through the search engine (Nagata and others,
2001; Huang et al., 2005). Another technique
which seems to be useful is that of transliteration
of names (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Oh and Choi,
2005).

We then manually examine their compositionality, and find out that 88% of them are actually compositional, which is a very encouraging result. But still, it is expensive to collect a domain/topic-specific corpus. Here, we adopt an approach of using the Web, since documents of various domains/topics are available on the Web. When validating translation candidates using the Web, roughly speaking, there exist the following two approaches. In the first approach, translation candidates are validated through the search engine (Cao and Li, 2002). In the second approach, a domain/topic-specific corpus is collected from the Web in advance and fixed 11 Figure 1: Compilation of a Domain/TopicSpecific Bilingual Lexicon using the Web before translation estimation, then generated translation candidates are validated against the domain/topic-specific corpus (Tonoike et al., 2005).

Furthermore, we examine the methods that combine two scoring functions based on their agreement. The experimental result shows that it is quite possible to achieve precision much higher than those of single scoring functions. 2 Overall framework The overall framework of compiling a bilingual lexicon from the Web is illustrated as in Figure 1. Suppose that we have sample terms of a specific domain/topic, then the technical terms that are to be listed as the headwords of a bilingual lexicon are collected from the Web by the related term collection method of (Sato and Sasaki, 2003). These collected technical terms can be divided into three subsets depending on the number of translation candidates present in an existing bilingual lexicon, i.e., the subset Xs of terms for which the number of translations in the existing bilingual lexicon is one, the subset Xs of terms for which the number of translations is more than one, and the subset YS of terms that are not found in the existing bilingual lexicon (henceforth, the union Xs ∪ Xs will be denoted as XS). Here, the translation estimation task here is to estimate translations for the terms of the subsets Xs and YS. A new bi</context>

However, there are limited number of parallel/comparable corpora that are available for the purpose of estimating bilingual term correspondences. Therefore, even if one wants to apply those existing techniques to the task of estimating bilingual term correspondences of technical terms, it is usually rather difficult to find an existing corpus for the domain of such technical terms. On the other hand, compositional translation estimation techniques that use a monolingual corpus (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2001; Tanaka and Baldwin, 2003) are more practical. It is because collecting a monolingual corpus is less expensive than collecting a parallel/comparable corpus. Translation candidates of a term can be compositionally generated by concatenating the translation of the constituents of the term. Here, the generated translation candidates are validated using the domain/topic-specific corpus. In order to assess the applicability of the compositional translation estimation technique, we randomly pick up 667 Japanese and English technical term translation pairs of 10 domains from existing technical term bilingual lexicons.

When validating translation candidates using the Web, roughly speaking, there exist the following two approaches. In the first approach, translation candidates are validated through the search engine (Cao and Li, 2002). In the second approach, a domain/topic-specific corpus is collected from the Web in advance and fixed 11 Figure 1: Compilation of a Domain/TopicSpecific Bilingual Lexicon using the Web before translation estimation, then generated translation candidates are validated against the domain/topic-specific corpus (Tonoike et al., 2005). The first approach is preferable in terms of coverage, while the second is preferable in terms of computational efficiency. This paper mainly focuses on quantitatively comparing the two approaches in terms of coverage and precision of compositional translation estimation. More specifically, in compositional translation estimation, we decompose the scoring function of a translation candidate into two components: bilingual lexicon score and corpus score. In this paper, we examine variants for those components and define 9 types of scoring functions in total. Regarding the above mentioned two a</context>

Roughly speaking, the scoring function corresponds to a variant of the model proposed by (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2001). The scoring is a variant of the model proposed by (Tonoike et al., 2005) and corresponds to the bilingual lexicon score of the scoring function The scoring function is intended to evaluate the approach proposed in (Cao an ‘prune’ ‘Final’ ‘corpus’,‘off-line’ ‘On-line’ ‘A’ function‘D’ ‘E’ ‘D’. ‘I’ d Li, 2002). � 10 ((s, t) in Eijiro) fprob((s,t)) = fB((s, t)) ((s, t) in B) guage corpus or not Qcorpus(yt) = { 1 yt occurs in a corpus 0 yt does not occur in a corpus (12) definition of the frequency of a tran slation pair in Eijiro is appropriate.
