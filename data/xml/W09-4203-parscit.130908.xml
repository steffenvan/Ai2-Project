<bodyText confidence="0.9998238">
In recent years, translators have increasingly turned to corpora
as a resource in their terminology searches. Consequently
university translation courses should include training for
future translators in the effective use of corpora, thus enabling
them to find the terminology they need for their translations
more quickly and efficiently.
This paper provides a classification of search techniques
in electronic corpora which may serve as a useful guide to the
efficient use of electronic corpora both in the training of
future translators, and for professional translators.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953142857143">
Terminology is a key factor in translators’ work. The
development of specialized fields has grown hand in hand
with advancements in science and technology. These
market demands explain why translators are calling for
resources to satisfy their terminological needs quickly and
effectively [1].
Dictionary creation cannot keep pace with
developments in specialized fields. Many studies show
dictionaries to be deficient in the lack of information they
include, speed of content update, and the limited ways of
accessing contents. For this reason, translators are
increasingly turning to other resources, such as the Internet
and corpora, to search for the terminology they need.
In this paper we analyze the search techniques offered
by a range of electronic corpora. Our search technique
classification is aimed to provide translation teachers with a
reference to help them teach students how to use corpora
efficiently. This classification may also be of interest to
professional translators who want to further their
knowledge of electronic corpora techniques in order to
improve their query results.

2. The need for corpora in translation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9912705">
Market demands require translators to work against tight
deadlines and with rapidly evolving vocabulary. According
to Varantola [22], fifty per cent of the time spent on a
translation is taken up with consulting reference resources.

Many studies have revealed that dictionaries do not satisfy
all translators’ terminological queries [5, 9, 16]. Gallardo
and Irazazábal [10] suggest that the terminology translators
need, apart from equivalents in different languages, should
also include contexts and information about the concept
that allow translators to decide how and where to use a
term.
In this vein, Zanettin [23] states that the use of corpora
in translation training was commonplace even before the
development of electronic corpora. Snell-Hornby [21] and
Shäffner [18], for instance, argue that by studying similar
texts in the source and target languages translators may
identify prototypical features that are useful for the target
text production.
Since the development of electronic corpora, the need
for these tools has become more evident, especially as a
terminology resource for translators. Several authors state
that translators need new terminological resources, such as
corpora [3, 4, 11, 15], which complement dictionary and
database use [8, 12, 19] and satisfy specific terminological
problems quickly and reliably.
Some studies have demonstrated that translation
quality improves when translators use corpora in their
terminology searches. Zanettin [23] conducted an
experiment with translation students from the School for
Translators and Interpreters at the University of Bologna.
He shows that comparable corpora1 help translation
students to compare the use of similar discourse units in
two languages and facilitate the selection of equivalents
adapted to the translation context. Bowker [3] carried out a
study with translation students from the School of Applied
Language and Intercultural Studies at Dublin City
University. She found that corpus-aided translations are of
higher quality than translations carried out only with the
aid of dictionaries. In a subsequent study, Bowker [4]
suggests various ways a target language corpus can be used
as a terminological resource for translators.
Despite the usefulness of corpora, the need to use a
range of resources to access terminology is a daily problem
facing translators. According to Alcina [1], if translators

independent original texts in two or more languages with
similar content, domain and communicative function.

have to undertake terminological tasks, whether searching
in a corpus or on the Internet, time is wasted and their
translation efficacy is poorer. As Varantola [22] states, the
success of a query depends on the intelligent use of search
tools.
Translation students should receive quality training at
university level in the use of new electronic resources in
order to respond to the demands of companies and
institutions [2]. Any training in electronic resources should
also include electronic corpora search techniques2. If this
were the case, translators would spend less time and effort
acquiring the competences to query corpora efficiently
once they have embarked on their professional career. If
translators know how to use search techniques in electronic
corpora, they will be able to satisfy their terminological
needs more quickly and efficiently and the quality of their
translations will improve.

This study analyzed the search functions of various stable
online corpora interfaces. Because we wanted to analyze
corpora that are easily accessible to translators, we selected
those that are available online. All the corpora analyzed
incorporate interfaces that allow different types of queries.
It is worth noting that many of these corpora are not
specifically designed for translators. In addition, each
corpus explains its own query options, but few studies
provide a comprehensive and systematized classification of
all the search techniques that can be used in a corpus.
Our classification will provide an overview of all the
search techniques that have been incorporated in electronic
corpora to date. We will use this classification in future
research to discover which of these search techniques are
useful for translators, in order to create electronic corpora
adapted to translators needs, as well as to teach translators
the range of search techniques used in electronic corpora.
In this section we briefly describe the corpora
analyzed, focusing on the particular features of each
corpus. Specific examples of queries in the corpora are
included in our search technique classification.
The Corpus de referencia del espafiol (CREA) and
the Corpus diacrónico del espafiol (CORDE) are two
monolingual online corpora developed by the Real
Academia Española. CREA contains modern Spanish texts
from 1975 to 2004. CORDE includes Spanish texts written
up to 1975. Both corpora allow the use of distance criteria
between words. Corpus filters such as field, author and
work, date, register, and geographic area can be applied.
Statistical data on search results, concordances and clusters
are also available.
2 Alcina [2] presents a didactic proposal divided into four levels
of specialization in Computerized Terminology. In this proposal
she includes training to query online corpora or other formats,
as well as the use of corpora search tools.
At Brigham Young University (BYU), Professor Davies
created an online interface for a set of monolingual
corpora: the Corpus del espafiol (Spanish from 1200s-
1900s), Corpus of Contemporary American English (US
English from 1990-2008), BYU-British National Corpus
(British English from 1980-1993), TIME Corpus (US
English from 1923-present), BYU-OED Oxford English
Dictionary (Old English-1990) and Corpus do Português
(Portuguese from 1300s-1900s).
This interface allows the user to search one or more
word forms, lemmas or parts of speech. Part of speech
restrictions can be applied. Searches can also be limited by
genre or over time. It compares the frequency of words,
phrases or grammatical constructions by genre or over
time. The user can search for collocates of a word or
compare collocates of two words. Another particular
feature is the semantically-oriented search, which enables
the user to search for synonyms3 of a word. Finally,
customized lists of words or phrases may be created for use
in a query.
The British National Corpus (BNC) is a monolingual
corpus of modern spoken and written British English. The
online interface allows the user to search for a word or
phrase. More complex queries can be carried out using the
SARA/XAIRA search tool (www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/rts/xaira)
or directly from the online search box using the BNC
Corpus Query Language, or the online CQP edition of the
BNC4.
The Hellenic National Corpus (HNC) is an online
monolingual corpus containing 47 million words developed
by the Institute of Language and Speech Processing. It
covers written Modern Greek since 1990. One feature of
this corpus is that it allows the user to define the distance
between three words, lemmas or parts of speech within the
same query5.
BwanaNet is an online corpus search tool developed
to query a collection of specialized corpora from the
Institut Universitari de Lingüística Aplicada (IULA) at the
Universitat Pompeu Fabra. This collection of corpora
includes original and parallel texts in Catalan, Spanish and
English, from the fields of Computing, Environment, Law,
Medicine, Genome, Economy, and other specialized areas.
This interface generates lists of word forms, lemmas or
parts of speech. Users can search for concordances of one
or more words, lemmas or parts of speech. Part of speech
restrictions have two features: 1) the option to delimit, in a
grammatical construction, the number of subsequent
occurrences of the same category (between 0 and 9), and 2)

only.

the search for a word form or lemma that excludes a
particular part of speech. The user can also limit the search
to a section of the corpus (titles, lists, tables, text). Other
queries can be carried out using the Corpus Query
Processor language6.
COMPARA is an online bidirectional aligned corpus
of English and Portuguese. To query this corpus, the user
needs to be familiar with the CQP language. The interface
allows the user to limit the search to linguistic variants of
Portuguese or English, date, author, etc. In addition,
concordance formats can be modified, for instance by
displaying alignment properties or part-of-speech tags.

4. Classification of search techniques in
corpora
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931777777778">
Search techniques are options that a user can apply to a
resource to obtain a result. We distinguish three elements in
a search technique: a query probe, a query resource and a
query outcome. The query probe is the word or phrase
introduced by the user in the interface of a resource. The
query resource is the resource or part of the resource in
which the word or phrase is searched. The query outcome
is the result obtained in a query when a probe is searched in
a resource.
In this paper we present a classification of search
techniques in electronic corpora that focuses on the query
probe, the query resource and the query outcome. An
example of a corpus search technique could be to use an
exact word as a probe, e.g., we look for the word play in an
English monolingual corpus (resource) to obtain a list of
concordances—the outcome—of the word play, which
includes expressions such as play the piano, play football
or play the role of.

4.1 Query probe
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987833333333">
The query probe is an expression the user tries to find by
introducing it in a corpus interface. We categorize query
probes as follows: lexical expressions, grammatical
expressions, numbers, hybrid expressions, and non-
continuous combinations of expressions. Filters may be
applied to restrict probes.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.994899">
4.1.1 Lexical expressions
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941043478261">
Lexical expressions can take a single form or a lemma, or a
sequence of forms or lemmas.
A lemma is the base form of a word, i.e., it is a word
without inflectional morphemes. The lemma of a noun is its
form with no gender or number morphemes. The lemma of
a verb is the infinitive.
A lemma is a useful way of retrieving all the forms in a
corpus that are tagged with that lemma. For example, if we
introduce the lemma do in the BYU-British National
Corpus, the corpus retrieves all the forms of this verb that
appear in the corpus: do, did, does, done, doing, etc.
A form can be exact or partial. An exact form is a
complete word. It can be useful for finding a particular
form of a word in the corpus. For instance, we can search
the plural word houses in any of the corpora analyzed.
A partial form is an incomplete word. The omitted
part of the word is replaced by a wildcard. The most
frequent wildcards are the asterisk (*), which replaces one
or more characters, and the question mark (?), which
replaces only one character. Partial forms can be useful if
we want to search all the words that start, end or contain a
specific sequence of characters. For example, if we
introduce the partial form hous* in the COMPARA corpus,
the following complete forms are retrieved: house,
housewife, housekeeper, house-doctor, houses, housing,
household, etc.
Lexical expressions can also be sequences of two or
more forms or lemmas, which may be exact or partial. An
exact sequence is a phrase or combination of forms or
lemmas that appear in the corpus in the same order as those
searched for. Exact sequences can be introduced to see the
context in which a particular expression is used. In the
following example we introduce the exact sequence of the
forms raining cats and dogs in the BNC. Two contexts are
retrieved: 1) “It was raining cats and dogs and the teachers
were running in and out helping us get our stuff in and just
couldn’t do enough for us.” 2) “What must you be careful
of when it’s raining cats and dogs?”
A partial sequence is a combination of forms or
lemmas in which one or more forms or lemmas are
replaced by a wildcard. It can be used to search for an
expression when we only know some of the words
contained in it. In this example we introduce a partial
sequence in the BYU Corpus del espaiiol: the verb llover as
a lemma, followed by the preposition a, and then a
wildcard, [llover] a *. Our search results include Spanish
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.987304">

<bodyText confidence="0.999593125">
expressions referring to ‘raining heavily’, such as llovía a
cántaros, llueve a torrentes, lloviendo a mares, lloviendo a
raudales, lloviendo a chuzos, llovía a baldes, etc.
Frequent sequences representing concept relationships,
also called linguistic patterns7, can also be introduced.
Some of these patterns can be used to retrieve, for instance,
defining contexts in a corpus (is a, known as, is defined, is
called, etc.).
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.998032">
4.1.2 Grammatical expressions
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986384363636364">
Grammatical expressions are constructions made up of
parts of speech. They may contain a single part of speech
or a sequence of parts of speech. Grammatical expressions
can be useful to find words or sequences of words by
introducing their parts of speech in the corpus.
This search technique is a feature of BwanaNet, BNC,
BYU corpora, COMPARA and HNC. For example, if we
introduce the grammatical expression “adjective+noun” in
the BwanaNet English Law corpus, the following
expressions are retrieved: commercial legislation, fiscal
protection, Social Fund, etc.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.994451">
4.1.3 Numbers
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851">
Numbers can be exact or partial. If we introduce an exact
number in the corpus, it is retrieved in the same form as it
was introduced. A partial number is a number combined
with a wildcard. In this case, the corpus retrieves all the
numbers containing the sequence of numbers introduced
with the wildcard. A number search can be useful to find
words that appear in the same context as a significant
number. For instance, if we introduce the number 640 in
the BwanaNet Spanish Computing corpus, the word píxel
appears, because the corpus retrieves the typical computing
measurement 640×480 píxels; the term memoria RAM is
also found, because another specific measurement retrieved
by the corpus is 640 Kb de memoria RAM.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.998576">
4.1.4 Hybrid expressions
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993091">
Hybrid expressions combine lexical expressions,
grammatical expressions and numbers. They can be useful
to find expressions in which we know the form or the
lemma of some of the words and the part of speech of other
words. For example, we introduce in the BwanaNet
English Law corpus a hybrid expression made up of a
grammatical expression followed by a lexical expression:
“adjective+law”. The following expressions are retrieved
organic law, civil law, common law, Federal law,
budgetary law, etc.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.993495">
4.1.5 Non-continuous combination of expressions

This search technique consists of introducing an element in

Meyer [14].
element must also appear. The first and the second element
can be any of the query probes explained above: a lexical
expression, a grammatical expression, a number or a hybrid
expression.
In the following example we combine two lexical
expressions in the BNC within a distance of 5 positions.
The first expression is the form Cytomegalovirus and the
second, an exact sequence of forms, the linguistic pattern is
a. As a result we obtain some defining contexts of the word
Cytomegalovirus.

In another example we use the BYU Corpus del espaiiol to

expressions 100 metros libre (100 meters free style) or 100

The Hellenic National Corpus is the only corpus

4.1.6 Query probe filters

<bodyText confidence="0.9762536">
Filters add a search restriction to the query probe
introduced, such as part-of-speech filters. For example,
BwanaNet allows the user to search for forms or lemmas
that may or not belong to a particular part of speech.
The following figure shows a query in the BwanaNet
English Computing corpus. We introduce the form e-mail

4.2 Query resource
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998970333333333">
The corpus resource is always the collection of texts that
constitute that corpus. Nevertheless, depending on the
query probe and outcome of a search technique, we can
distinguish different types of electronic corpora8:
monolingual corpora, aligned corpora and tagged corpora.
Filters can also be used to restrict the corpus.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.997898">
4.2.1 Monolingual corpora
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959">
An electronic corpus can be monolingual, i.e., all the texts
in the corpus are written in the same language. In this type
of corpora the query probe and outcome will always be in
one specific language.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.999177">
4.2.2 Aligned corpora
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994836875">
An electronic corpus can also be aligned. An aligned
corpus is a parallel corpus composed of source texts and
their translations. The introduction of query probes in
monolingual and aligned corpora is usually the same but
the query outcomes obtained vary.
In aligned corpora the query probe is normally
introduced in one of the corpus languages, as in
monolingual corpora. However, in aligned corpora, search
results include the segments in one language, as well as
equivalent segments in the second language. For example,
when we introduce the form run in the English part of the
COMPARA corpus, the concordances in English are given
with the form run highlighted in bold. Equivalent segments
in Portuguese appear next to the concordances of the form
run. The equivalents of run (montar, correr and comprar)
are not highlighted.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.680976833333333">
8 Many authors have elaborated wider typologies of corpora in
which all the types of corpora are described. See, for example,
Corpas [6], Zanettin [24] and Sinclair [20]. In this paper, we
have limited our classification of corpora according to what can
we introduce in the corpus (the probe) and what can we obtain
(the outcome).

Some aligned corpora also allow the user to introduce
query probes simultaneously in both corpus languages. The
COMPARA corpus offers an alignment restriction option
that allows the user to introduce a query probe in one
language with the condition that its equivalent segments
contain another query probe. In the following example we
introduce the form run in the English part of the
COMPARA corpus, and the lemma correr in the
Portuguese part. The corpus retrieves concordances of the

Portuguese include the lemma correr. In the concordances
both the form run and all the forms of the lemma correr are

<bodyText confidence="0.791752428571429">
Corpora may either be tagged or not, and if they are, they
may be tagged at different levels. In POS-tagged corpora
all the words are tagged with their part of speech.
Grammatical expressions can only be introduced in tagged
corpora. In lemmatized corpora all the words in the
corpus are tagged with their lemma. Lemmas can only be
introduced in lemmatized corpora.

4.2.4 Query resource filters

<bodyText confidence="0.9992975625">
The corpus search can be restricted to one section of the
corpus using filters, such as thematic field, text type,
geographic area, author, date, and text area.
The thematic field filter limits the corpus to sections
of a selected thematic field. The BwanaNet, CQP edition of
the BNC, CREA, and CORDE corpora offer this option.
The text type filter limits the search to texts of a specific
genre. This filter is available in the CREA, CORDE, CQP
edition of the BNC, and BYU corpora. The geographic
area filter limits the search to texts from a specific
language area. For example, in the COMPARA corpus the
search can be restricted to Portuguese from Angola,
Portugal, Brazil and Mozambique, or to English from
South Africa, United Kingdom or the United States. The
CQP edition of the BNC also offers a geographic area
filter.

one or more authors. This filter is offered in the
COMPARA, CREA and CORDE corpora. The date filter
limits the search to texts published on a specific date or
within a time period, and is a feature of the COMPARA,
the CQP edition of the BNC, CREA, CORDE and BYU
corpora. The text area filter limits the search to titles, lists,
tables, etc. BwanaNet offers this filter. The CQP edition of
the BNC allows the user to search in titles and keywords.

4.3 Query outcome
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996002">
When an electronic corpus is queried, the user can select
different types of query outcomes depending on the result
he/she desires. These query outcomes may be a list of
monolingual or aligned concordances, a list of words, a list
of synonyms, a list of collocates or a list of clusters.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.851624">
4.3.1 List of concordances
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999847571428571">
Concordances are the contexts in which the query probe
appears. Most of the corpora provide concordances in an
easy to read format called KWIC (key words in context),
which means that the query probe is highlighted in the
center of the context. Depending on the query resource
used in a search technique, lists of concordances can be
monolingual or bilingual.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.444828">
4.3.1.1 List of monolingual concordances
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95800175">
Monolingual corpora can generate lists of monolingual
concordances, i.e., lists of contexts in one language.
Monolingual concordances are mainly used to observe a
word in context. For example, if we look for the
concordances of the lexical expression Prime Minister in
the BNC we access contexts in English where this
expression is used.
Another function of concordances is to find a word by
searching for words that appear in a nearby context. For
example, we can search in the BYU-OED Oxford English
Dictionary corpus to find a word that refers to “a case
where an archer holds arrows”. In this case, we introduce
the lemma arrow within 9 positions of distance to the part
of speech “noun”. The corpus retrieves concordances of
nouns appearing near the forms of arrow; one of these
nouns is the word quiver.
Table 5. Concordances of the lemma arrow within 9 positions
of distance from the noun quiver

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.541914">
4.3.1.2 List of bilingual concordances
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998618">
Aligned corpora can generate lists of bilingual
concordances, which are lists of contexts in one language
with equivalent contexts in another language. Bilingual
concordances allow the user to decide on a more reliable
translation equivalent because both the query probe in the
source language and its equivalent in the target language
are situated in a context that can be compared with the
context of the translation, thus allowing the translator to
verify equivalence.
In the following example we introduce the form play
in the COMPARA aligned corpus and search for its
concordances. Depending on the context, play is translated
in Portuguese as tocar (when it refers to a music
instrument), jogar (when it refers to a sport) or fazer a
(when it refers to playing a role).

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.993051">
4.3.2 Word lists
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972857142857">
There are two types of word lists. One type includes the
most frequent words in a corpus. The other is a list of
keywords, which are extracted by comparing the word
frequency lists of two corpora; the result is a list of words
that are typical of one corpus, which are different from the
other corpus9.
Word lists can provide a useful overview of the
specific terminology in a field. Of the corpora analyzed,
BwanaNet provides lists of words with the option isolated
tokens. The lists in BwanaNet may be of forms, lemmas or
parts of speech. The BYU corpora also generate word lists.
In these corpora, the user must introduce a part of speech
and the corpora generate word lists that are tagged with
that part of speech. The CQP edition of the BNC generates
word or lemma frequency lists and allows the user to limit
the lists introducing word patterns or using part-of-speech
filters. This corpus also generates lists of keywords
comparing the frequency lists of the whole BNC, the
written BNC, and the spoken component of the BNC.
For example, if we generate a list of lemmas in the
BwanaNet English Economy corpus, the first lemmas in the
list are, logically, general language words, mainly
prepositions and articles, since these are the most frequent
words in every corpus. However, the sign = appears at the
top of the list, as a typical component of economic texts.
Other words from this field, such as rate, market, price,
good, capital, investment, etc, also appear near the
beginning.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.582541">
4.3.3 List of synonyms
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98345025">
Some corpora have incorporated semantically-based
searches. This option allows the user to find synonyms for
the word introduced. Of the corpora analyzed in this study,
only the BYU corpora provide this option.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.903126666666667">

corpora.

<bodyText confidence="0.999992125">
In the following example, we use the BYU Corpus of
Contemporary American English to search for synonyms of
the form beautiful, by introducing [=beautiful]. A list of
synonyms is provided: wonderful, attractive, striking,
lovely, handsome, etc. The frequency of each synonym in
the corpus and access to concordances of the synonyms are
given. We can also compare the frequency and distribution
of the synonyms in the corpus by text type and dates.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.551039">
4.3.4 List of collocates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987104052631579">
A collocate is a word that frequently appears near another
word. Lists of collocates can be useful to access the words
in the context of a term without having to read all its
concordances. This function helps to speed up the search
process.
In all the corpora, collocates of a word can be seen by
reading all the contexts of that word. However, of the
corpora analyzed, only the BYU corpora generate lists of
word collocates in which the part of speech of the collocate
is specified. For example, if we search in the BYU Corpus
of Contemporary American English for the noun collocates
of the form television, the retrieved list of collocates
includes: radio, news, show, cable, network, station, series,
etc.
Collocates of word synonyms can also be accessed.
For instance, the BYU Corpus del español lists the nouns
that appear near the synonyms of sucio (dirty); retrieved
collocates include the words pocilga (pigsty) or tugurio
(hovel or dive).
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.588475">
4.3.5 List of clusters
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963222222222">
Clusters are sequences of two or more words that are
frequent in a corpus. Various query probes can be
introduced in a search for clusters. We may choose not to
specify a query probe and only specify the number of
words we want the cluster to have (two or more). We can
specify a word that must appear in the cluster, for instance
mesita (table). We can also specify the grammatical
sequence of the cluster, for example clusters of
“noun+adjective+adjective”. Words and parts of speech
that must be included in the clusters can also be specified,
for example “mesita+preposition+adjective”.
Lists of clusters can provide a useful overview of how
terminology is frequently combined in a field. They can
also be used to find a word if we know other words it is
frequently combined with, or a typical construction in
which the word appears.
Of the corpora analyzed, BwanaNet generates two-
word clusters without specifying a query probe. The BYU
corpora retrieve clusters specifying words or parts of
speech that must appear in the clusters. CREA and CORDE
generate clusters specifying one or more words that must
appear in the clusters. For example, in the CREA corpus
we can search for clusters of three words that include the
word mesita (table). The retrieved list includes the
following clusters: mesita de noche (bedside table), mesita
de madera (wooden table), mesita de luz (lamp table),
mesita del teléfono (telephone table), etc.

5. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999163888888889">
This study has shown how search techniques can vary from
one corpus to another. Within the context of translator
training in the use of corpora, there is a need to systematize
the search techniques that can be used in electronic
corpora. The classification of search techniques provided in
this paper, focusing on the query probe, resource and
outcome, attempts to meet that need. These three elements
have been considered to explore the range of search
possibilities corpora offer.
</bodyText>

Table 7. Classification of search techniques in corpora
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998265">
Although our search technique classification is subject to
further additions and variations, it has two main
applications. First, it will help us to reflect on the most
useful search techniques for translators, thus enabling us to
consider improvements in corpora to adapt these resources
to translators needs. Second, it may serve as a guide in
teaching translation students search techniques in electronic
corpora.

The development of specialized fields has grown hand in hand with advancements in science and technology. These market demands explain why translators are calling for resources to satisfy their terminological needs quickly and effectively [1]. Dictionary creation cannot keep pace with developments in specialized fields. Many studies show dictionaries to be deficient in the lack of information they include, speed of content update, and the limited ways of accessing contents. For this reason, translators are increasingly turning to other resources, such as the Internet and corpora, to search for the terminology they need. In this paper we analyze the search techniques offered by a range of electronic corpora. Our search technique classification is aimed to provide translation teachers with a reference to help them teach students how</context>

Bowker [3] carried out a study with translation students from the School of Applied Language and Intercultural Studies at Dublin City University. She found that corpus-aided translations are of higher quality than translations carried out only with the aid of dictionaries. In a subsequent study, Bowker [4] suggests various ways a target language corpus can be used as a terminological resource for translators. Despite the usefulness of corpora, the need to use a range of resources to access terminology is a daily problem facing translators. According to Alcina [1], if translators 1 Zanettin [23] defines a comparable corpus as a collection of independent original texts in two or more languages with similar content, domain and communicative function. 13 NLP Methods and Corpora in Translation, Lexicography, and Language Learning 2009 – Borovets, Bulgaria, pages 13–20 have to undertake terminological tasks, whether searching in a corpus or on the Internet, time is wasted and their translation efficacy is poorer.

The Corpus de referencia del espafiol (CREA) and the Corpus diacrónico del espafiol (CORDE) are two monolingual online corpora developed by the Real Academia Española. CREA contains modern Spanish texts from 1975 to 2004. CORDE includes Spanish texts written up to 1975. Both corpora allow the use of distance criteria between words. Corpus filters such as field, author and work, date, register, and geographic area can be applied. Statistical data on search results, concordances and clusters are also available. 2 Alcina [2] presents a didactic proposal divided into four levels of specialization in Computerized Terminology. In this proposal she includes training to query online corpora or other formats, as well as the use of corpora search tools. At Brigham Young University (BYU), Professor Davies created an online interface for a set of monolingual corpora: the Corpus del espafiol (Spanish from 1200s1900s), Corpus of Contemporary American English (US English from 1990-2008), BYU-British National Corpus (British English from 1980-1993), TIME Corpus (US English from 1923-present), BYU-OED Oxford English Dictionary</context>

For example, when we introduce the form run in the English part of the COMPARA corpus, the concordances in English are given with the form run highlighted in bold. Equivalent segments in Portuguese appear next to the concordances of the form run. The equivalents of run (montar, correr and comprar) are not highlighted. 8 Many authors have elaborated wider typologies of corpora in which all the types of corpora are described. See, for example, Corpas [6], Zanettin [24] and Sinclair [20].

See, for example, Sánchez [17], Faber et al. [8], López and Tercedor [13] or Meyer [14]. element must also appear. The first and the second element can be any of the query probes explained above: a lexical expression, a grammatical expression, a number or a hybrid expression. In the following example we combine two lexical expressions in the BNC within a distance of 5 positions. The first expression is the form Cytomegalovirus and the second, an exact sequence of forms, the linguistic pattern is a. As a result we obtain some defining contexts of the word Cytomegalovirus.

Our search technique classification is aimed to provide translation teachers with a reference to help them teach students how to use corpora efficiently. This classification may also be of interest to professional translators who want to further their knowledge of electronic corpora techniques in order to improve their query results. 2. The need for corpora in translation Market demands require translators to work against tight deadlines and with rapidly evolving vocabulary. According to Varantola [22], fifty per cent of the time spent on a translation is taken up with consulting reference resources.

As Varantola [22] states, the success of a query depends on the intelligent use of search tools. Translation students should receive quality training at university level in the use of new electronic resources in order to respond to the demands of companies and institutions [2]. Any training in electronic resources should also include electronic corpora search techniques2. If this were the case, translators would spend less time and effort acquiring the competences to query corpora efficiently once they have embarked on their professional career.
