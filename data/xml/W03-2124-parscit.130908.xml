<bodyText confidence="0.999063608695652">
A key challenge for users and designers of
spoken language systems is determining
the form of the commands that the system
can recognize. Using more than 60 hours
of interactions, we quantitatively analyze
the acquisition of system vocabulary by
novice users. We contrast the longitudi-
nal performance of long-term novice users
with both expert system developers and
guest users. We find that novice users
successfully learn the form of system re-
quests, achieving a significant decrease in
ill-formed utterances. However, the work-
ing vocabulary on which novice users con-
verge is significantly smaller than that
of expert users, and their rate of speech
recognition errors remains higher. Finally,
we observe that only 50% of each user’s
small vocabulary is shared with any other,
indicating the importance of the flexibility
of a conversational interface that allows
users to converge to their own preferred
vocabulary.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975847826087">
Most currently deployed interactive spoken lan-
guage systems employ a restricted vocabulary and
syntax for system commands. These constraints pro-
vide greater recognition accuracy and faster recogni-
tion times. (Makhoul, 1993) However, they also re-
quire the system developer to provide a command
language that is expressive enough to accomplish
the tasks for which the speech system was designed
and flexible enough to allow use by a wide variety
of users with different levels of experience with the
system. In turn, the users must learn the constrained
language that is understood by the system. A con-
versational interface attempts to step away from a
rigid command language with, for example, a sin-
gle form for any command, to provide a set of well-
formed inputs that have more varied and natural syn-
tax and admit a range of synonymous terms and con-
structions. While it has been demonstrated that even
with substantial synonymy, users will still choose
terms outside the system’s vocabulary some percent-
age of the time (Furnas et al., 1987), it is hoped that
the flexibility of a conversational interface will allow
some natural individual variability and potentially
ease the task for novice users. A key challenge for
the user is thus to produce well-formed input to the
system under these restrictions, and for the system
designer to provide a set of commands that it is easy
for the user to learn. (Brennan, 1998) demonstrate
that users adopt the system’s terminology, most re-
liably with explicit correction, but also with im-
plicit correction, similar to the way in which pairs
of human speakers converge on a lexical referent.
(Walker et al., 1998) observe anecdotally that users
learn system vocabulary over time. (Yankelovich,
1996) and (Kamm et al., 1998) explore techniques
to guide users to produce well-formed queries, with
a variety of strategies and tutorials, respectively. The
above studies have focused on pure novice users
within their first few interactions with the system
and on the goal of task achievement. Here, we ana-
lyze quantitatively the process by which users learn
the language understood by the system, by exploring
natural interactions during the course of a field trial
conducted over a period of months. We analyze not
only task completion or command recognition, but
also the vocabulary acquired itself.

2.1 Speech System Description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987">
The speech system utilized in the field trial is a pro-
totype spoken language system that provides a voice
interface to a variety of common desktop and in-
formation feed services, including e-mail, on-line
calendars, weather information, and stock quotes.
Two significant features distinguish this system from
other spoken language systems. First, since it was
designed for use over the telephone to provide ubiq-
uitous access, it is a voice-only system. Almost all
user input is spoken, recognized with BBN’s Hark
speech recognizer, and all output is through synthe-
sized speech, using Centigram’s TruVoice.
Secondly, the spoken language system was de-
signed to provide a ”conversational” interface as de-
scribed above, aiming to provide a more natural,
flexible alternative to a fixed command language.
All new users receive a wallet-sized information
card with examples of common commands, but, as
we will demonstrate later in this paper, users each
rapidly develop their own distinct forms.
The system was deployed for a field trial to a lim-
ited number of participants. All interactions were
recorded yielding approximately sixty hours of in-
teractions conducted over several months. In addi-
tion to the audio, speech recognizer results, natural
language analysis results, and the text of all system
responses were stored.

2.2 Subjects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99952425">
The subjects participating in the field trial fell into
three distinct classes: 14 Novice Users, with no pre-
vious experience with this spoken language system,
4 Expert Users, long-term members of the system’s
development staff, and Guest Users, one-time users
of a public demonstration system.
There were three female, two novice and one ex-
pert, and fifteen male regular system users, twelve
novice and 3 expert. The users engaged in at least
ten phone conversations with the system. The dis-
tribution of users allows us to examine the develop-
ment of novice users’ interaction style, in terms of
vocabulary choice and number of out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) utterances. In addition, we can contrast the
different recognition accuracy rates and vocabulary
distributions of expert and novice users.
</bodyText>

2.3 Data Coding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992175">
All user utterances were manually transcribed and
paired with their corresponding speech recognizer
output. Each of these pairs was assigned one of
four accuracy codes: Correct, Error minor, Error,
or Rejection. The “error minor” code assignments
generally resulted from a misrecognition of a non-
content word (e.g. an incorrect article) compensated
for by the robust parser. The “error” and “rejec-
tion” codes were assigned in those cases where a
user could identify a failure in the interaction. Utter-
ances coded either as Error or Rejection could also
receive an additional tag, OOV. This tag indicates
that either words not in the recognizer’s vocabulary
or constructions not in the system’s grammar were
used in the utterances. For simplicity, we refer to
both cases as OOV. Two examples appear below:

3 Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988975">
In total, there were 7529 recorded user utterances.
Of these, 4865 were correctly recognized, and 702
contained minor recognition errors, but still resulted
in the desired action. There were 1961 complete
recognition failures: 1250 of which were rejection
errors and 706 of which were misrecognition errors.
The remaining errors were due to system crashes or
parsing errors. Overall, this yields 25% error rate.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992">
Excluding errors by guest users, nearly 350 errors
resulted from OOV utterances. More than half of
these cases involved unknown words and one quarter
involved unknown grammatical constructions. The
remainder were valid utterances for a different ap-
plication, but were invalid in the application context
in which they were used.
To understand the users’ lexical acquisition, we
will look at three specific features of user vocabu-
lary: error and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates over
time, vocabulary size and rate of new words over
time, and degree of vocabulary overlap among users.

3.1 Error and OOV Rates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999317461538461">
We conduct a longitudinal examination of error and
out-of-vocabulary utterance rates. Overall rates are
given as averages, and longitudinal rates are in ut-
terances per hundred. Figure 1 compares the dis-
tributions of overall average error rates and out-of-
vocabulary rates for all novice users to that for ex-
pert users. We find significantly higher rates of over-
all recognition (24.86% versus 10.75%) and OOV
(7.39% versus 0.76%) errors for novices than for ex-
pert users.
Do these errors rates, especially the higher novice
user error rates, change over time, and if so, how and
how much? To track these longitudinal changes, or

changes over time, we recompute the error and OOV
rates from above in terms of the number of errors per
hundred utterances for the first, second, and third set
of one hundred utterances, and so on.
We observe that neither the expert users (10.75%)
nor the guest users (41%) show any significant
change in error rate over time. However, novices
show a distinct decrease in errors after the first hun-
dred utterances (Figure 2). We can quantify this
contrast by comparing number of errors in the first
hundred utterances to the average number of er-
rors per hundred utterances for the later interac-
tions. This contrast is a significant decrease by t-test,
paired, two-tailed. ( ), showing that novice
users make fewer errors over time, but still at a much
higher rate than expert users.1
This observation comes as no surprise; however,
we would like to know which features of novice
vs. expert user interaction account for this contrast.
Specifically, to what degree do out-of-vocabulary ut-
terances or speech acoustics differentially affect the
error rates of these two subject groups? Can all con-
trasts be related to limited knowledge of the system’s
vocabulary? Experts, naturally, exhibit very few in-
stances of out-of-vocabulary utterances. Here we
&apos;For longitudinal analysis, we consider only those users with

consider the change in rate of OOV’s in novice user
utterances over time and contrast it with that of the
guest user class. There is a significant decrease in
OOV’s over time for longer term users (Figure 2) in
contrast with an almost constant OOV rate for guest
users (20%) and for expert users ( 1%). Specifi-
cally there is a significant decrease in the number
of OOVs between the first hundred utterances and
all subsequent interactions. This is clearly a desir-
able trend, indicating the new users’ increasing fa-
miliarity with the limited vocabulary understood by
the system.
However, repeating the above error rate analysis
after excluding OOV-related errors, we find that the
decrease in error rates with time is not significant.
The decrease in OOV errors is thus the primary con-
tributor to the perceived improvement in recognition
rate over time. In addition, even with all OOV errors
removed, the error rates of novices are still much
higher than those of expert users (18.25% versus
10.25%), indicating that expert use of a spoken lan-
guage system requires more than just the knowledge
of the utterances understood by the system. This
knowledge is acquired fairly rapidly as we see by
the drop in OOV rates, but the knowledge of proper
speaking style, such as timing and pausing, is more
difficult.

3.2 Vocabulary Size and Rate of New Word
Introduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999487166666667">
Here we will use two measures to try to clarify
the process of OOV reduction: number of words in
working vocabulary (defined as number of discrete
words per hundred words spoken) and rate of intro-
duction of new words into the working vocabulary
(again in words per hundred). Unsurprisingly, the
rate of new word introduction undergoes a signif-
icant decrease over time - for all except the guest
user category - and, like OOVs, drops dramatically
after the first 200-300 words. Analysis of variance
of number of new words to point in time is highly
significant (F=59.27, df=323, )
The trend for the working vocabulary is quite
interesting and somewhat unexpected. There is a
significant decrease in vocabulary size over time.
Specifically, there is a significant decrease in the
number of unique words per hundred between the
first 200-300 words and all later interactions. (F =

who begin with an average working vocabulary of
54 words, after working with the system, converge
on a surprisingly small working vocabulary of an av-
erage of 35 distinct words per hundred. This small
vocabulary size contrasts strongly with the 50 dis-
tinct words per hundred of the expert users 2. From
this analysis, we can see that the decrease in out-
of-vocabulary utterances arises from a narrowing of
the users’ working vocabulary to a fairly small set of
words in which the user has high confidence.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999376">
3.3 Vocabulary Overlap
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99971305">
What ramifications does this use of a small work-
ing vocabulary have for conversational speech user
interface design? Is it simply irrelevant since only
a small set of words is needed by any user? An
analysis of cross-user vocabulary will help to answer
these questions. Here we tabulated the percentage
of words shared between any pair of users and the
percentage of a user’s vocabulary that overlaps with
any other’s. We see that, for any pair of users, be-
tween 18 - 57% of vocabulary is held in common,
with an average of 21% of the union of the two vo-
cabularies falling in the intersection (Table 1). 3 This
translates to each user sharing approximately 50% of
their words with any other given user.
This relatively small proportion of overlap be-
tween users attests to the value of the conversa-
tional interface. While the users individually do not
have large vocabularies, the choice of words across
users is highly varied. This supports the notion of
a flexible vocabulary that allows users to gravitate

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964384615385">
We observe the significant reduction in recognition
errors, largely through a reduction in ill-formed ut-
terances, of novices over their first two to three hun-
dred utterances. This accomplishment supports the
anecdotal reports that users learn system vocabulary
over time, but most impressively, demonstrates the
speed with which users acquire the necessary vo-
cabulary, even in the absence of explicit guidance
or correction.
Many of these early OOV errors arise from issues
in speech system design. Two design goals often
come into conflict: keeping the active recognition
vocabulary small to improve recognition speed and
accuracy and providing a consistent and wide cover-
age vocabulary to the users to enhance flexibility and
functionality. Stock quotes and weather searches are
limited to a small subset of possible cases: technol-
ogy stocks and major U.S. cities respectively. Errors
arise as users, for instance, try to query Canadian
cities. These limitations could be clarified in the
system prompts. Likewise, only application-specific
vocabulary and a small general vocabulary are ac-
tive at any time. Users, rather naturally, generalize
vocabulary use, and encounter a significant number
of errors due to utterances that would be acceptable
in another portion of the system. For example, “can-
cel” halts e-mail sending, but was erroneously used
to try to stop other system activities. Thus, focusing
on consistent vocabulary and structure across appli-
cations is desirable. Finally, since the system reads
e-mail headers and bodies, the system inevitably vi-
olates the dictum that it should never say words that
the system can not itself recognize. Users frequently
try to use these terms themselves and learn over only
time that they are not in the recognizer’s vocabulary.
It is necessary to develop a strategy to differenti-
ate this type of content from regular conversational
turns, possibly through a different synthetic voice.
The skilled novice users still differ significantly
from expert users in two respects: overall recogni-
tion accuracy and working vocabulary size. Novice
users gradually remove ill-formed utterances from
their input to the system. They achieve this result, in
part, by converging on a small working vocabulary
in which they have high confidence. Interestingly,
this vocabulary varies substantially among users,
suggesting an advantage to the conversational inter-
face that allows users more flexibility in their choice
of words and constructions. We still find, though,
that even if we exclude all errors resulting from out-
of-vocabulary utterances from consideration, novice
users suffer from significantly worse speech recog-
nition performance than do the expert system de-
velopers. Many of these remaining errors involve
speaking too soon, speaking too slowly, or speak-
ing with lengthy pauses. These limitations in over-
all speech recognition accuracy and restricted vo-
cabulary indicate that additional training that guides
users to a suitable speaking style and full exploita-
tion of the system’s vocabulary and capabilities is
necessary for the competent novice users to become
true experts.

Finally, we observe that only 50% of each user’s small vocabulary is shared with any other, indicating the importance of the flexibility of a conversational interface that allows users to converge to their own preferred vocabulary. Keywords Spoken Language System; NoviceExpert; Lexical Entrainment 1 Introduction Most currently deployed interactive spoken language systems employ a restricted vocabulary and syntax for system commands. These constraints provide greater recognition accuracy and faster recognition times. (Makhoul, 1993) However, they also require the system developer to provide a command language that is expressive enough to accomplish the tasks for which the speech system was designed and flexible enough to allow use by a wide variety of users with different levels of experience with the system. In turn, the users must learn the constrained language that is understood by the system. A conversational interface attempts to step away from a rigid command language with, for example, a single form for any command, to provide a set of wellformed inputs that have more varied and natural syntax and admit a range of</context>

A key challenge for the user is thus to produce well-formed input to the system under these restrictions, and for the system designer to provide a set of commands that it is easy for the user to learn. (Brennan, 1998) demonstrate that users adopt the system’s terminology, most reliably with explicit correction, but also with implicit correction, similar to the way in which pairs of human speakers converge on a lexical referent. (Walker et al., 1998) observe anecdotally that users learn system vocabulary over time. (Yankelovich, 1996) and (Kamm et al., 1998) explore techniques to guide users to produce well-formed queries, with a variety of strategies and tutorials, respectively. The above studies have focused on pure novice users within their first few interactions with the system and on the goal of task achievement. Here, we analyze quantitatively the process by which users learn the language understood by the system, by exploring natural interactions during the course of a field trial conducted over a period of months. We analyze not only task completion or command recognition, but also the vocabulary acquired itself. 2</context>
