<bodyText confidence="0.999940333333333">
This tutorial discusses a framework of online
global discriminative learning and beam-search
decoding for syntactic processing (Zhang and
Clark, 2011b), which has recently been applied
to a wide variety of natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, including word segmentation (Zhang
and Clark, 2007), dependency parsing (Zhang and
Clark, 2008b; Huang and Sagae, 2010; Zhang and
Nivre, 2011; Bohnet and Kuhn, 2012), context
free grammar (CFG) parsing (Collins and Roark,
2004; Zhang and Clark, 2009; Zhu et al., 2013),
combinational categorial grammar (CCG) parsing
(Zhang and Clark, 2011a; Xu et al., 2014) and
machine translation (Liu, 2013), achieving state-
of-the-art accuracies and efficiencies. In addition,
due to its high efficiencies, it has also been ap-
plied to a range of joint structural problems, such
as joint segmentation and POS-tagging (Zhang
and Clark, 2008a; Zhang and Clark, 2010), joint
POS-tagging and dependency parsing (Hatori et
al., 2011; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012), joint mor-
phological analysis, POS-tagging and dependency
parsing (Bohnet et al., 2013), and joint segmenta-
tion, POS-tagging and parsing (Zhang et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., 2014).
In addition to the aforementioned tasks, the
framework can be applied to all structural pre-

diction tasks for which the output can be con-
structed using an incremental process. The advan-
tage of this framework is two-fold. First, beam-
search enables highly efficient decoding, which
typically has linear time complexity, depending on
the incremental process. Second, free from DP-
style constraints and Markov-style independence
assumptions, the framework allows arbitrary fea-
tures to be defined to capture structural patterns.
In addition to feature advantages, the high accura-
cies of this framework are also enabled by direct
interactions between learning and search (Daum´e
III and Marcu, 2005; Huang et al., 2012; Zhang
and Nivre, 2012).

2 Tutorial Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999678352941176">
In this tutorial, we make an introduction to the
framework, illustrating how it can be applied to
a range of NLP problems, giving theoretical dis-
cussions and demonstrating a software implemen-
tation. We start with a detailed introduction of
the framework, describing the averaged percep-
tron algorithm (Collins, 2002) and its efficient im-
plementation issues (Zhang and Clark, 2007), as
well as beam-search and the early-update strategy
(Collins and Roark, 2004). We then illustrate how
the framework can be applied to NLP tasks, in-
cluding word segmentation, joint segmentation &amp;
POS-tagging, labeled and unlabeled dependency
parsing, joint POS-tagging and dependency pars-
ing, CFG parsing, CCG parsing, and joint segmen-
tation, POS-tagging and parsing. In each case, we
illustrate how the task is turned into an incremen-
tal left-to-right output-building process, and how
rich features are defined to give competitive accu-
racies. These examples can serve as guidance in
applying the framework to other structural predic-
tion tasks.
In the second part of the tutorial, we give
some analysis on why the framework is effective.
We discuss several alternative learning algorithms,

and compare beam-search with greedy search on
dependency parsing. We show that accuracy bene-
fits from interaction between learning and search.
Finally, the tutorial concludes with an introduction
to ZPar, an open source toolkit that provides op-
timized C++ implementations of of all the above
tasks.

The advantage of this framework is two-fold. First, beamsearch enables highly efficient decoding, which typically has linear time complexity, depending on the incremental process. Second, free from DPstyle constraints and Markov-style independence assumptions, the framework allows arbitrary features to be defined to capture structural patterns. In addition to feature advantages, the high accuracies of this framework are also enabled by direct interactions between learning and search (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005; Huang et al., 2012; Zhang and Nivre, 2012). 2 Tutorial Overview In this tutorial, we make an introduction to the framework, illustrating how it can be applied to a range of NLP problems, giving theoretical discussions and demonstrating a software implementation. We start with a detailed introduction of the framework, describing the averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) and its efficient implementation issues (Zhang and Clark, 2007), as well as beam-search and the early-update strategy (Collins and Roark, 2004).
