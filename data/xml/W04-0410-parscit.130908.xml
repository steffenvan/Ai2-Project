1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994180795180723">
Defining frozen sentences is not easy, and many
conceptual and terminological disputes on concur-
rent terms (‘idioms’, ‘collocations’, ‘phrasèmes’,
etc.) can be found in the literature (M. Gross 1988;
G.Gross 1996; Mejri 1997; Mel’cuk 1993; Mogor-
rón-Huerta 2002; Gaatone 2000; Jurafsky &amp; Mar-
tin 2000: 571-573; McKeown &amp; Rodev 2000;
Mutsimoto 2003: 395). As a first approach to a
(consensual?) definition, frozen sentences are ele-
mentary sentences where the main verb and at least
one of its argument noun-phrases are distribution-
ally constraint, and usually the global meaning of
the expression cannot be calculated from the indi-
vidual meaning of its component elements when
they are used independently (M. Gross 1982, 1989,
1996; G. Gross 1996; Ranchhod 2003). For that
reason, the whole expression must be taken as a
complex, multiword lexical unit. For example, in:
(1) O João matou dois coelhos de uma cajadada
(lit: ‘John killed two rabbits with one blow’, John
killed two birds with one stone) the verb-object
combination (matar-coelhos) is frozen. One cannot
replace coelhos (rabbits) for another animal and
the numeral determinant is necessarily dois (two).
Also, it is not possible to modify coelhos with any
free adjective (dois coelhos *gordos/ *grandes,
two fat/big rabbits). In addition, the adverbial de
uma cajadada (with one blow) can hardly be ze-
roed, or the meaning of the sentence becomes lit-
eral. On the other hand, frozen sentences usually
present some, often highly constraint, formal varia-
tion. For the most part, this variation is strictly
lexical. In this case, in the adverbial, the noun ca-
jadada (lit: a blow with a stick) can be replaced by
assentada and vez (turn), but the meaning of the
expression remains unchanged. This variation does
not happens elsewhere. Furthermore, if we disre-
gard proverbs1, completely frozen sentences are
rare. Usually, one or more of its argument noun
phrases are distributionally free. In this case, any
human noun can adequately occupy the structural
position of subject. The frozen verb-noun combi-
nation is responsible for this distributional con-
straint, which can be considerably different from
the constraints imposed by the verb when func-
tioning as an independent lexical unit. For exam-
ple, the verb matar (to kill) admits both human and
non-human (animate and abstract) nouns for its
subject when its object is coelhos (rabbits): (2a) O
João/a raposa/o tiro/a praga matou dois coelhos
(John/the fox/ shooting/ plague killed two rabbits).
Another way frozen sentences often differ from
free sentences is the fact that they block transfor-
mations that should otherwise be possible, given
the syntactic properties of the main verb and its ar-
guments. Hence, while it is possible to form from
(2a) the passive sentence (2b): (2b) Dois coelhos
foram mortos pelo João/ a raposa/ o tiro/ a praga
(Two rabbits were killed by John/ the fox/ shoot-
1 Proverbs differ from frozen sentences (a) from not
having any free elements, (b) in the way they function
in discourse, which is similar to quotations and (c) for
their general value as advices or as atemporal truths
about human life. However, partly because of their be-
ing an oral tradition, even proverbs can show some for-
mal variation (Chacoto 1994).
ing/ plague), the same does not happen with (1):
(1a) °Dois coelhos foram mortos pelo João de uma
cajadada (Two rabbits were killed by John with
one blow), since the meaning of the sentence be-
comes literal (this is shown by symbol ‘°’). Finally,
frozen sentences constitute a non-trivial problem
for many NLP applications. Since they are multi-
word expressions functioning as meaning units,
they have to be identified as a block. However,
their elements can appear discontinuously and they
can also present some formal variation. They are
often ambiguous, the same sequence having both a
literal and a figurative meaning – and in this case,
only an extended context can disambiguate them.
They constitute an important part of the lexicon,
comparable to (but probably much larger than)
simple verbs.

2 Classification of Frozen Sentences
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960571428572">
Many frozen sentences, especially those that are
most usual or most obviously idiomatic, have al-
ready been collected both in general and in spe-
cialized dictionaries of ‘idioms’. In these diction-
aries, frozen sentences are usually undistinguished
from other types of multiword expressions, such as
compound nouns, adverbs, prepositions, conjunc-
tions, proverbs, and so on. In order to build an
electronic dictionary of frozen sentences of Euro-
pean Portuguese, several sources where used, in-
cluding specialized dictionaries2, and completed
with newspapers, magazines, etc. and our knowl-
edge as native speakers of Portuguese. The formal
framework of M. Gross (1982, 1989, 1996; see Le-
clère 2002, for an updated overview) was adopted
to classify frozen sentences. The classification is
based on the sentence structure, the number and
type of noun phrases attached to the main verb,
their frozen or free nature, as well as the syntactic
properties of the construction. Table 1 shows some
formal classes3, their internal structure, an illustra-

of frozen sentences of Brazilian Portuguese (Vale 2001)
was also consulted, but many of those sentences either
do not exist if European Portuguese or else present sub-
stantial syntactical and lexical differences, so that a de-
tailed comparative study is in order.

tences collected so far. Compared with figures
available for other languages – French (+20,000;
M.Gross 1996), Spanish (3,500; Mogorrón-Huerta
2002), Greek (4,500; Fotopoulou 1993) and Bra-
zilian Portuguese (3,500; Vale 2001), it is clear
that these lists are still far from complete and
should, in fact, be completed, probably using other
corpus-based methods for lexical acquisition
(McKeown &amp; Rodev 2000, Mutsimoto 2003).

3 Format of Dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999876333333333">
The electronic dictionary is composed of several
matrices, one per formal class. In these matrices,
each line is a frozen sentence and the columns con-
tain the lexical elements of the sentence and their
syntactic (distributional and transformational)
properties. The set of matrices constitute the lexi-
con-grammar of frozen sentences. Table 2 is a
sample of class CPN. This class is defined by hav-
ing a prepositional phrase where only the head-
noun C is frozen with the verb, while its determi-
native complement de N (of N) is free: N0 V Prep
(C de N)1.

4 Syntactic Properties
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975260051282051">
For lack of space, only some of the most promi-
nent properties will be considered here. For each
sentence, the distributional constraints (human/
non-human noun) on the free noun phrases are
indicated: ‘+’ if the sentence admits it, ‘-’ if it
does not. In this class, these are the subject and
the determinative complement of C. Usually, the
verb can inflect freely, thus its lemma is shown in
brackets &lt; &gt;. In some sentences, V presents an
intrinsically reflexive construction (noted Vse):
(3) O Pedro atirou-se aos pés da Ana &lt;e pediu-
lhe para ficar&gt; (Peter threw himself to the feet of
Ana &lt;and begged her to stay&gt;. The reflex pro-
noun cannot be replaced by a noun phrase of the
same distributional nature but not coreferent to
the subject: O Pedro atirou *o João / ºo livro aos
pés da Ana (Peter threw John/the book to the feet
of Ana). Usually, this reflex pronoun cannot be
zeroed. However, some verbs allow this zeroing
of the pronoun: (4) O Pedro riu(-se) na cara da
Ana (Peter laughs (himself) at the face of Ana). In
this case, the simplest way is to double the entry.
Also in some cases, there is an obligatory nega-
tion (NegObrig): (5) O Pedro não /nunca /nem
chega aos calcanhares da Ana (lit: Peter does
not/never/not even gets to the heels of Ana, Peter
is not a match for Ana). The half-frozen noun
phrase can often undergo an operation called da-
tive restructuring (Leclère 1995), that splits the
noun phrase in two and where the determinative
complement becomes a dative complement a N
(to N) of the verb: (6) O Pedro foi às trombas do
João = ao João (lit: Peter went to the snouts of/to
John, Peter hit John). This operation depends on
the metonymical relation between C and the noun
of its free determinative complement. The new
dative complement can be reduced to a dative
clitic pronoun (-lhe): (6a) Pedro foi-lhe (= ao
João) às trombas do João. However, dative re-
structuring must be systematically checked for
each sentence, since some sentences do not admit
it: (7) O Pedro foi na cantiga do João/ *ao João/
*-lhe (lit: Peter went in the song of John, Peter
was persuaded by John’s ill-intended words). In
some cases, however, the restructured noun
phrase: (8a) O salário do Pedro sai-lhe do pelo
(lit: Peter’s salary gets him out from the fur, To
earn his salary, Peter has to work very hard) is
much more acceptable than its basic form: &apos;*O
salário sai do pelo do Pedro (The salary gets out
from Peter’s fur) 4. The determinative comple-
ment can also be reduced to an oblique or to a
possessive pronoun: (7a) O Pedro foi na cantiga
do João = na cantiga dele = na sua cantiga, but
in some cases, the reduction to a possessive is
blocked: (6b) O Pedro foi às trombas do João =
&apos;às trombas dele = *&apos;às suas trombas. Finally,
there can be some facultative, free insertions be-

(double) metonymical relation of Pedro with both the
head noun of both the subject and object noun phrase.
tween the verb and the prepositional phrase: (9) A
fama subiu (rapidamente/logo) à cabeça do
Pedro (Fame went up (quickly/soon) to Peter’s
head). As one can see, these properties may be
independent from each other and some of them
can appear in combination in the same sentence.
For example, obligatory negation can combine
with the reduction do possessive pronoun: (5a) O
Pedro ndo chega aos sews calcanhares (lit: Peter
does not get to the his heels, Peter is not a match
for him) or with the dative pronoun resulting
from the noun phrase restructuring: (5b) O Pedro
ndo te chega aos calcanhares (lit: Peter does not
get you to the heels, Peter is not a match for you).
In both cases, the pronouns appear inserted be-
tween the characteristic (and fixed) elements of
this frozen sentence.

The lexicon-grammar of frozen sentences (i.e. the
set of matrices) cannot be directly applied to rec-
ognize these expressions in texts. Using INTEX
linguistic development platform (M. Silberztein
1993, 2004)5 it is now possible to build lexical
finite state transducer that can identify and tag
frozen sentences in the texts where they occur.
This is done by building a reference graph for
each matrix. Fig. 1 (above) shows a simplified
version of the reference graph for class CPN.
This graph describes the formal sequences of
the components of the frozen sentences. In this
graph, variables such as @X refer to the content of

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9972345625">
the matrix (at column X). Furthermore, this graph
is an enhanced transducer, where it is possible to
define variables containing strings of elements
and to reuse these variables in the transduction.
For example, in the top line of the graph, vari-
able V (inside brackets) stores the verb (repre-
sented by @C). This is followed by a facultative
subgraph, for any eventual insertions (in the
shadowed box), and it is then followed by vari-
able CP1, containing the frozen prepositional
phrase. The two variables are then reused in the
transduction (the output in bold, on the right),
providing the multiword lexical entry and its ade-
quate tags: $V $PC1,@C @F @G @H
@I.V+CPN, so that for the frozen sentence: (7c)
O Pedro foi na cantiga do João the system would
produce the tag: O Pedro {foi na can-
tiga,ir em a cantiga.V+CPN} do João.
Notice that the inflected form of the verb appear-
ing in the text is lemmatized (after the coma) us-
ing the @X variables to retrieve the lexical ele-
ments in the matrix: in this case, the infinitive ir
(to go); also in the lemma, the contraction (na) of
preposition em and the definite article a is split in
its component elements. Finally, variables @D,
@E, @K and @L function as switches, reading
the ‘+’ or ‘-’ of the corresponding columns in the
matrix so that the remaining transitions are either
activated or collapsed. These variables corre-
spond to the syntactic properties of the entries. In
this way, it is possible to compile a detailed FST
that complies with the syntactic restrictions de-
scribed in the matrix.
After building the reference graph, the system
is then able to compile the lexical transducer for
this class, exploring, for each line of the matrix,
all the paths of the graph, and then determinizing
and minimizing the resulting transducer. With
this methodology, the linguistic information
stored in the lexicon grammar is represented in-
dependently from the lexical transducers and can
be regularly revised or updated. The reference
graph can also be seen as describing linguistic in-
formation regarding the surface disposition of the
lexical elements entering the frozen sentences of
the matrix. Of course, strict formal coherence in
needed between the reference graph and the ma-
trix.

Several comparisons are thus made in Table 6

increase in the same proportion:

Another measure is the ratio between the lexi-
cal diversity (LexDiv) of DLE (number of en-
tries/different lemmas) and precision (P). The
higher the diversity of the DLE, the lower should
be the precision. This, however, does not happen:
even if the larger corpus shows lower DLE diver-
sity, the ratio LexDiv/P is higher than in the two
smaller texts. Therefore, lower precision in
CETEMPúblico is not significant. Similarly, one
could compare ratio between the lexical diversity
of correct matches (correct matches/different
lemmas) and precision. In theory, this ratio
should be smaller if the lexical diversity of cor-
rect matches were higher. Instead, CETEMPúblico
shows a higher CMDiv/P ratio than the two
smaller texts, therefore confirming the signifi-
cance of the precision rate obtained with the fro-
zen sentences’ dictionary. Finally, we present, as
an indication of frequency, the average number of
correctly matched frozen sentences per thousand
sentences in each text. This varies from 1.042 %o

As it was said above, precision of the results is
relatively high. In fact, most word combinations
in the dictionary of frozen sentences are unique,
therefore, unambiguous combinations. The finite-
state approach adopted here is based on matching
strings that could correspond to the characteristic
word sequence of each frozen sentence. How-
ever, going through the concordances manually,
some incorrect matches were detected and it
would be impossible to comment on all those
cases here, so only a few cases (all from
CETEMPúblico), will be discussed.
Mostly, mismatches were due to morphologi-
cally (orthographically) ambiguous words. In the
sentence: O general António Ramalho Eanes está
de volta à cera política (General António Rama-
lho Eanes is back to the political scene) volta is
not verb, but a noun. Still, this noun is a nomi-
nalization of voltar (with a resultative aspectual
value): voltar à cena = estar de volta a cena , so
that the overall meaning is stil the same. Other
nominalizations of the same kind were also
founded, e.g. usar da palavra = fazer uso da pa-
lavra (to speak, in a formal situation). Therefore,
the study of frozen sentences with verbal predi-
cates should be extended to their corresponding
nominalizations (M. Gross 1986). Another inter-
esting aspect of this example is the fact that the
noun cena appears with the adjective política (po-
litical, referring to politics). In the dictionary, the
entry of the frozen sentence was just voltar à
cena. As one can see, it will still be necessary to
complete the dictionary allowing C to be modi-
fied by this kind of adjectives, with which they
form compound nouns (G. Gross 1988).
Sometimes, the matched string is formally am-
biguous with free constructions: Como resultado,
a Comunidade dá de si uma imagem de paralisia
(Has a result, the Community gives of itself an
image of paralysis). The expression dar de si
(class CP1) usually has a non-human subject
meaning ‘to break’,’to fall apart’. In this case,
however, we have a construction of the noun im-
agem, with two distributionally free comple-
ments, such as we find in the next example: Isso
deu uma imagem negativa da comunidade (That
gave a negative image of the community). If it
were possible to identify the noun phrase a Co-
munidade and its head as a human noun, and to
associate a construction to the noun imagem, the
ambiguity would not arise, since the distributional
properties stated in the CP1 matrix for dar de si
would prevent it from being tagged. However,
this goes well beyond the mere task of lexical
analysis and it would require some parsing proce-
dure to avoid the incorrect lexical tag. Ambiguity
also arises from the syntactic operations under-
went by a free sentence. These transformations
may produce strings that are superficially identi-
cal to frozen sentences. In the following example:
[...] e em vez de se dirigir às máquinas, foi para
a rua que Júlia Pinho teve de caminhar [...] (in-
stead of approaching the machines, it was to the
street that JP had to walk), we find a cleft sen-
tence with the form foi of verb ser (to be). This
sentence can be obtained from: JP teve de camin-
har para a rua (JP had to walk to the street).
Now, foi of verb ser (to be) is ambiguous with foi
of verb ir (to go/walk) appearing in the frozen
sentence ir para a rua (lit: to go to the street, ‘to
be fired’). Again, ambiguous strings will not be
resolved unless some syntactic parsing is done in
order to recognize transformations (in this case,
clefting).
The components of certain frozen sentences
may, also, be particularly apt to become ambigu-
ous strings. For example, in the expression fazer
das suas (lit: to do of his-fem.pl., to do mischief)
the possessive pronoun is a lexical constant, in-
variable in both gender, and number, while agree-
ing in person with the subjet: Fergie tornou fazer
das suas (Fergie has done mischief again). How-
ever, the possessive often appears as a mere de-
terminant on a free construction, e.g. João Hon-
rado nunca fez das suas certezas uma muralha de
arrogância (JH has never done of his certainties a
wall of arrogance). One could think that people
tend avoid this kind of ambiguity, but it is not al-
ways so: 6 out of 14 matched sequences fazer das
suas do not correspond to the frozen sentence.
Likewise, with the expression partir do zero/nada
(to start from scratch) 7 out of 14 matches corre-
spond to the compound adverb a partir do
zero/nada (from scratch). Notice also that this
frozen adverb, undoubtedly related with the fro-
zen sentence but appearing with various verbs,
also composed of a compound preposition a par-
tir de (from), so the expression is three times am-
biguous grammatically. A similar ambiguity be-
tween occurs between frozen sentence N0 dizer
respeito a N2 (N0 concerns to N1; 299 matches)
and the related compound adverb no que diz re-
speito a N (concerning N; 215 matches).
Finally, while most frozen sentences constitute
unique word combinations and present a clear-
cut, single meaning (however difficult it may be
to define it precisely), more rarely, some of them
show multiple meanings. This is the case of en-
trar em campo (to enter the field) or entrar em
cena (enter the scene) used in some sports or in
theater jargon and as a general metaphor to ‘begin
some activity’. These multi-meaning frozen sen-
tences can be dealt with in the same way as
polisemic simple words, by multiplying the num-
ber of entries in the lexicon-grammar.

Being an on-going research, it is still too early
to write ‘conclusions’. We believe that with the
continuation of current work the size of the elec-
tronic dictionary of frozen sentences of European
Portuguese will still increase in a significant way.
Present experiments on large corpora will un-
doubtedly contribute to this goal. Statistical
methods for collecting frozen sentences should be
combined with our more traditional method of pe-
rusing dictionaries.
Finite-state techniques prove to be adequately
for the lexical analysis of frozen sentences. Fro-
zen sentences constitute an important part of mul-
tiword lexical units of any language. Their identi-
fication is an essential part of lexical analysis of
texts in view of many NLP applications. They
present several, non-trivial difficulties to this
task. They may be formed of non-adjacent words
or allow some lexically constraint variation of
some of their elements. They allow several syn-
tactic transformations, but those operations are
lexically determined. They may be ambiguous
with free sentences, depending on the linear ar-
rangement of their components. Their accurate
recognition may often depend on the previous
syntactic parsing of the sentence, which may in-
clude checking the semantic attributes of nearby
noun phrases. On the other hand, parsing depends
on the availability of information regarding mul-
tiword lexical units.

In these dictionaries, frozen sentences are usually undistinguished from other types of multiword expressions, such as compound nouns, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, proverbs, and so on.

The formal framework of M. Gross (1982, 1989, 1996; see Leclère 2002, for an updated overview) was adopted to classify frozen sentences.

Still, this noun is a nominalization of voltar (with a resultative aspectual value): voltar à cena = estar de volta a cena , so that the overall meaning is stil the same. Other nominalizations of the same kind were also founded, e.g. usar da palavra = fazer uso da palavra (to speak, in a formal situation). Therefore, the study of frozen sentences with verbal predicates should be extended to their corresponding nominalizations (M. Gross 1986). Another interesting aspect of this example is the fact that the noun cena appears with the adjective política (political, referring to politics). In the dictionary, the entry of the frozen sentence was just voltar à cena. As one can see, it will still be necessary to complete the dictionary allowing C to be modified by this kind of adjectives, with which they form compound nouns (G. Gross 1988). Sometimes, the matched string is formally ambiguous with free constructions: Como resultado, a Comunidade dá de si uma imagem de paralisia (Has a result, the Community gives of itself an image of par</context>

Usually, this reflex pronoun cannot be zeroed. However, some verbs allow this zeroing of the pronoun: (4) O Pedro riu(-se) na cara da Ana (Peter laughs (himself) at the face of Ana). In this case, the simplest way is to double the entry. Also in some cases, there is an obligatory negation (NegObrig): (5) O Pedro não /nunca /nem chega aos calcanhares da Ana (lit: Peter does not/never/not even gets to the heels of Ana, Peter is not a match for Ana). The half-frozen noun phrase can often undergo an operation called dative restructuring (Leclère 1995), that splits the noun phrase in two and where the determinative complement becomes a dative complement a N (to N) of the verb: (6) O Pedro foi às trombas do João = ao João (lit: Peter went to the snouts of/to John, Peter hit John). This operation depends on the metonymical relation between C and the noun of its free determinative complement. The new dative complement can be reduced to a dative clitic pronoun (-lhe): (6a) Pedro foi-lhe (= ao João) às trombas do João. However, dative restructuring must be systematically checked for each sentence, since some sentences do not admit it: (7) O Pedr</context>

It will focus on the problems arising from the description of their formal variation in view of natural language processing 1 Introduction Defining frozen sentences is not easy, and many conceptual and terminological disputes on concurrent terms (‘idioms’, ‘collocations’, ‘phrasèmes’, etc.) can be found in the literature (M. Gross 1988; G.Gross 1996; Mejri 1997; Mel’cuk 1993; Mogorrón-Huerta 2002; Gaatone 2000; Jurafsky &amp; Martin 2000: 571-573; McKeown &amp; Rodev 2000; Mutsimoto 2003: 395). As a first approach to a (consensual?) definition, frozen sentences are elementary sentences where the main verb and at least one of its argument noun-phrases are distributionally constraint, and usually the global meaning of the expression cannot be calculated from the individual meaning of its component elements when they are used independently (M. Gross 1982, 1989, 1996; G. Gross 1996; Ranchhod 2003). For that reason, the whole expression must be taken as a complex, multiword lexical unit. For example, in: (1) O João matou dois coelhos de uma cajadada (lit: ‘John killed two rabbits </context>

N and C stand for noun phrases; N is a free tive example, and the approximate number of sentences collected so far. Compared with figures available for other languages – French (+20,000; M.Gross 1996), Spanish (3,500; Mogorrón-Huerta 2002), Greek (4,500; Fotopoulou 1993) and Brazilian Portuguese (3,500; Vale 2001), it is clear that these lists are still far from complete and should, in fact, be completed, probably using other corpus-based methods for lexical acquisition (McKeown &amp; Rodev 2000, Mutsimoto 2003).

One cannot replace coelhos (rabbits) for another animal and the numeral determinant is necessarily dois (two). Also, it is not possible to modify coelhos with any free adjective (dois coelhos *gordos/ *grandes, two fat/big rabbits). In addition, the adverbial de uma cajadada (with one blow) can hardly be</context>

Reference graph for class CPN 5 Lexical Finite-State Transducers: building a reference graph The lexicon-grammar of frozen sentences (i.e. the set of matrices) cannot be directly applied to recognize these expressions in texts. Using INTEX linguistic development platform (M. Silberztein 1993, 2004)5 it is now possible to build lexical finite state transducer that can identify and tag frozen sentences in the texts where they occur. This is done by building a reference graph for each matrix. Fig. 1 (above) shows a simplified version of the reference graph for class CPN. This graph describes the formal sequences of the components of the frozen sentences. In this graph, variables such as @X refer to the content of 5 http://www.nyu.edu/pages/linguistics/intex/. the matrix (at column X). Furthermore, this graph is an enhanced transducer, where it is possible to define variables contain</context>
