Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99173185">
The use of NLP in educational applications is becoming increasingly widespread and sophisticated.
Such applications are intended to fulfil a variety of needs, from automated scoring of essays and short-
answer responses, to grammatical error detection, to assisting learners in the development of their
writing, reading, and speaking skills, in both their native and non-native languages.
The rapid growth of this area of research is evidenced by the number of topic-specific workshops in
recent years. This workshop is the next in a series which began at ACL 1997 and continued on with
HTL/NAACL 2003 and ACL 2005. Since 1997, there have also been other related meetings such as
the InSTIL/ICALL Symposium at COLING 2004, and most recently the CALICO 2008 workshop
entitled Automatic Analysis of Learner Language: Bridging Foreign Language Teaching Needs and
NLP Possibilities.
In keeping with previous workshops, our aim is to bring together the ever-growing community of
researchers from both academic institutions and industry, and foster communication on issues regarding
the broad spectrum of instructional settings, from K-12 to university level to EFL/ESL and professional
contexts. In this endeavor, we are assisted by the wide variety of topics and languages covered by the
papers presented.
For this workshop, we received 18 submissions, and accepted 13 papers: 8 were accepted as long
presentations (20 minutes) and 5 as short presentations (15 minutes). All accepted papers are published
in these proceedings as full-length papers of up to 9 pages. Each paper was reviewed by two members
of the Program Committee.
The papers in this workshop fall under several main themes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984336941176471">
• Second Language Learner Systems Several papers detail work on systems aimed at helping
students learn. [Dickinson et al.] describe an ICALL system for learners of Russian; the King
Alfred system [Michaud] provides a translation environment to assist learners of Anglo-Saxon
English; [Pendar et al.]’s approach to the identification of discourse moves aims to improve
students’ scientific writing; and [Hldaka et al.] present a corpus-based approach to help Czech
students in their study of syntax. [Nagata et al.] present work on detecting romanized Japanese
words in written learner English. Finally, [Bernhard et al] describe a method for answering a
student’s question via paraphrasing.
• Automatic Assessment There are also several papers on automatic assessment, including scoring
the semantic content of student responses [Bailey et al.] [Nielsen et al.] and automatically scoring
speech fluency [Zechner et al.].
• Readability Another concern is the readability of materials presented to students, and how to
identify materials at appropriate difficulty levels for the intended audience. The issue of retrieval
is discussed by [Heilman et al. (b)], while the prediction of reading difficulty is the topic of
[Miltsakaki et al.] and [Heilman et al. (a)]
• Intelligent Tutoring [Boyer er al.] discuss ways to improve feedback given to students in a
tutorial dialogue setting.
