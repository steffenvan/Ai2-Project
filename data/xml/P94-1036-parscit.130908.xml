While LIG-equivalent formalisms have been shown to
provide adequate formal power for a wide range of lin-
guistic phenomena (including the aforementioned Swiss
German construction), the need for other mathemati-
cal formalisms has arisen in several unrelated areas. In
this paper, we discuss three such cases. First, captur-
ing several semantic and syntactic issues in unification-
based formalisms leads to the use of multiset-valued
feature structures. Second, word order facts from lan-
guages such as German, Russian, or Turkish cannot be
derived by LIG-equivalent formalisms. Third, a gener-
alization of trees to &amp;quot;quasi-trees&amp;quot; (Vijay-Shanker, 1992)
in the spirit of D-Theory (Marcus et al., 1983) leads
to the definition of a new formal system. In this pa-
per, we introduce two new equivalent mathematical for-
malisms which provide adequate descriptions for these
three phenomena.
The paper is structured as follows. First, we present
the three phenomena in more detail. We then introduce
multiset-valued LIG and present some formal proper-
ties. Thereafter, we introduce a second rewriting sys-
tem and show that it is weakly equivalent to the LIG
variant. We then briefly mention some related for-
malisms. We conclude with a brief summary.

Three Problems for LIG-Equivalent

The three problems we present are of a rather differ-
ent nature. The first arises from the way a linguis-
tic problem is treated in a specific type of framework
(unification-based formalisms). The second problem
derives directly from linguistic data. The third prob-
lem is a formalism which has been motivated on in-
dependent, methodological grounds, but whose formal

This paper defines multiset-valued linear index gram-
mar and unordered vector grammar with dominance
links. The former models certain uses of multiset-
valued feature structures in unification-based for-
malisms, while the latter is motivated by word order
variation and by &amp;quot;quasi-trees&amp;quot;, a generalization of trees.
The two formalisms are weakly equivalent, and an im-
portant subset is at most context-sensitive and polyno-

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998579">
Early attempts to use context-free grammars (CFGs) as
a mathematical model for natural language syntax have
largely been abandoned; it has been shown that (un-
der standard assumptions concerning the recursive na-
ture of clausal embedding) the cross-serial dependencies
found in Swiss German cannot be generated by a CFG
(Shieber, 1985). Several mathematical models have
been proposed which extend the formal power of CFGs,
while still maintaining the formal properties that make
CFGs attractive formalisms for formal and computa-
tional linguists, in particular, polynomial parsability
and restricted weak generative capacity. These mathe-
matical models include tree adjoining grammar (TAG)
(Joshi et al., 1975; Joshi, 1985), head grammar (Pollard,
1984), combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steed-
man, 1985), and linear index grammar (LIG) (Gaz-
dar, 1988). These formalisms have been shown to be
weakly equivalent to each other (Vijay-Shanker et al.,
1987; Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1994); we will refer to
them as &amp;quot;LIG-equivalent formalisms&amp;quot;. LIG is a vari-
ant of index grammar (IG) (Aho, 1968). Like CFG, IG
is a context-free string rewriting system, except that
the nonterminal symbols in a CFG are augmented with
stacks of index symbols. The rewrite rules push or pop
indices from the index stack. In an IG, the index stack
is copied to all nonterminal symbols on the right-hand
side of a rule. In a LIG, the stack is copied to exactly
one right-hand side nonterminal.&apos;
&apos;Note that a LIG is not an IG that is linear (i.e., whose
productions have at most one nonterminal on the right-hand
side), but rather, it is a context-free grammar with linear
indices (i.e., the indices are never copied).

the case that the full power of the system is used in
the linguistic analyses that are expressed in it. HPSG
analyses include information about constituent struc-
ture which can be represented as a context-free phrase-
structure tree. In addition, various mechanisms have
been proposed to handle certain linguistic phenomena
that relate two nodes within this tree. One of these
is a multiset-valued feature that is passed along the
phrase-structure tree from daughter node to mother
node. Multiset-valued features have been proposed for
the SLASH feature which handles tvh-dependencies (Pol-
lard and Sag, 1994, Chapter 4), and for certain semantic
purposes, including the representation of stored quan-
tifiers in a mechanism similar to Cooper-storage. An-
other use may be the representation of anti-coreference
constraints arising from Principle C of Binding Theory
(be it that of (Chomsky, 1981) or of Pollard and Sag
(1992)).
It is desirable to be able to assess the formal power
of such a system, for both theoretical and practical
reasons. Theoretically, it would be interesting if it
turned out that the linguistic principles formulated in
HPSG naturally lead to certain restricted uses of the
unification-based formalism. Clearly this would repre-
sent an important insight into the nature of grammat-
ical competence. On the practical side, formal equiv-
alences can guide the building of applications such as
parsers for existing HPSG grammars. For example, it
has been proposed that HPSG grammars can be &amp;quot;com-
piled&amp;quot; into TAGs in order to obtain a computationally
more tractable system (Kasper, 1992), thus sidestep-
ping the issue of building parsers for HPSG directly.
However, LIG-equivalent formalisms cannot serve as
targets for compilations in cases in which HPSG uses
multiset-valued feature structures.

Word Order Variation

Becker et al. (1991) discuss scrambling, which is the
permutation of verbal arguments in languages such as
German, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Russian, and Turk-
ish. If there are embedded clauses, scrambling in many
languages can affect arguments of more than one verb
(&amp;quot;long-distance&amp;quot; scrambling).

... that the refrigeratorAcc so far yet
niemand [t; zu reparieren] versprochen hat
no-oneNom to repair promised has
... that so far, no-one has promised to repair the re-
frigerator
Scrambling in German is &amp;quot;doubly unbounded&amp;quot; in the
sense that there is no bound on the number of clause
boundaries over which an element can scramble, and
an element scrambled (long-distance or not) from one
clause does not preclude the scrambling of an element
from another clause:
(2) ... daB [dem Kunden] [den KiihIschrankb

... that so-far, no-one yet has promised the client to
repair the refrigerator
Similar data has been observed in the literature for
other languages, for example for Finnish by Karttunen
(1989). Becker et al. (1991) argue that a simple TAG
(and the other LIG-equivalent formalisms) cannot de-
rive the full range of scrambled sentences. Rambow and
Satta (1994) propose the use of unordered vector gram-
mar (UVG) to model the data. In UVG (Cremers and
Mayer, 1973), several context-free string rewriting rules
are grouped into vectors, as for verspricht &apos;promises&apos;:

During a derivation, rules from a vector can be ap-
plied in any order, and rules from different vectors can
be interleaved, but at the end, all rules from an instance
of a vector must have been used in the derivation. By
varying the order in which rules from different vectors
are applied, we can derive different word orders. Ob-
serve that the vector in (3) contains exactly one ter-
minal symbol (the verb); grammars in which every el-
ementary structure (vector in UVG, tree in TAG, rule
in CFG) contains at least one terminal symbol we will
call lexicalized.
Languages generated by UVG are known to be
context-sensitive and semilinear (Cremers and Mayer,
1974) and polynomially parsable (Satta, 1993). How-
ever, they are not adequate for modeling natural lan-
guage syntax. In the following example, (4a) is out since
there is no analysis in which the moved NP c-commands
its governing verb, as is the case in (4b).

Quasi-Trees

<bodyText confidence="0.916552333333333">
Vijay-Shanker (1992) introduces &amp;quot;quasi-trees&amp;quot; as a gen-
eralization of trees. He starts from the observation
that the traditional definition of tree adjoining gram-

<bodyText confidence="0.99998">
mar (TAG) is incompatible with a unification-based ap-
proach because the trees of a TAG start out as fully
specified objects, which are later modified; in particu-
lar, immediate dominance relations in a tree need not
hold after another tree is adjoined into it. In order to ar-
rive at a definition that is compatible with a unification-
based approach, he makes three minimal assumptions
about the nature of the objects used for the representa-
tion of natural language syntax. The first assumption
(left implicit) is that these objects represent phrase-
structure. The second assumption is that they &amp;quot;give
a sufficiently enlarged domain of locality that allows
localization of dependencies such as subcategorization,
and filler-gap&amp;quot; (Vijay-Shanker, 1992, p.486). The third
assumption is that dominance relations can be stated
between different parts of the representation. These
assumptions lead Vijay-Shanker to define quasi-trees,
which are partial descriptions of trees in which &amp;quot;quasi-
nodes&amp;quot; (partial descriptions of nodes) are related by
dominance constraints. Each node in a traditional tree
(as used in TAG) corresponds to two quasi-nodes, a top
and a bottom version, such that the top dominates the
bottom.
There are two ways of interpreting quasi-trees: ei-
ther quasi-trees can be seen as data structures in their
own right; or quasi-trees can be seen as descriptions
of trees whose denotations are sets of (regular) trees.
If quasi-trees are defined as data structures, we can
define operations such as adjunction and substitution
and notions such as &amp;quot;derived structure&amp;quot;. More pre-
cisely, we define quasi-trees to be structures consisting
of pairs of nodes, called quasi-nodes, such that one is
the &amp;quot;top&amp;quot; quasi-node and the other is the &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot;
quasi-node. The top and bottom quasi-node of a pair
are linked by a dominance constraint. Bottom quasi-
nodes immediately dominate top quasi-nodes of other
quasi-node pairs, and each top quasi-node is immedi-
ately dominated by exactly one bottom quasi-node. For
simplicity, we will assume that there is only a bottom
root quasi-node (i.e., no top root quasi-node), and that
bottom frontier quasi-nodes are omitted (i.e., frontier
nodes just consist of top quasi-nodes). Furthermore,
we will assume that each quasi-node has a label, and
is equipped with a finite feature structure. A sample
quasi-tree is shown in Figure 1 (quasi-tree ot5 of Vijay-
Shanker (1992, p.488)).
We follow Vijay-Shanker (1992, Section 2.5) in defin-
ing substitution as the operation of forming a quasi-node
pair from a frontier node of one tree (which becomes the
top node) and the root node of another tree (which be-
comes the bottom node). As always, a dominance link
relates the two quasi-nodes of the newly formed pair.
Adjunction is not defined separately: it suffices to say
that a pair of quasi-nodes is &amp;quot;broken up&amp;quot;, thus forming
two quasi-trees. We then perform two substitutions.
Observe that nothing keeps us from breaking up more
than one pair of quasi-nodes in either of two quasi-trees,
and then performing more than two substitutions (as

long as dominance constraints are respected); there are
no operations in regular TAG that correspond to such
operations. We will say that a quasi-tree is derived if in
all quasi-node pairs, the two quasi-nodes are equated,
meaning that they have the same label and the two
feature structures are unified, and furthermore, if all
frontier quasi-nodes have terminal labels. The string
associated with this quasi-tree is defined in the usual
way.
We have now fully defined a formalism (if informally):
its data structures (quasi-trees), its combination oper-
ation (substitution), and the notion of derived struc-
ture. We will call this formalism Quasi-Tree Substitu-
tion Grammar (QTSG). It can easily be seen that all
examples discussed by Vijay-Shanker (1992) are deriva-
tions in QTSG. The question arises as to the formal and
computational properties of QTSG.

Multiset-Valued LIG
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.871262454545455">
In order to find a mathematical model for certain uses
of multiset-valued feature structures, discussed above,
we now introduce a multiset-valued variant of LIG. We
denote by M(A) the set of multisets over the elements
of A, and we use the standard set notation to refer to
the corresponding multiset operations.
Definition 1 A multiset-valued Linear Index
Grammar ({}-LIG) is a 5-triple (VN, VT 1/i, P, S),
where VN , VT, and VI are disjoint sets of terminals,
non-terminals, and indices, respectively; S E VN is the
start symbol; and P is a set of productions of the fol-
lowing form:
p: As vorlisivi • • • Vn- 1 Bn Sn Vn
for some n &gt; 0, A, B1, ..., Bn E VN, s, si, mul-
tisets of members of VI, and vo, ...,v„ E 1/4; .
The derivation relation for a {}-LIG is defined
as follows. Let 13,7 E (VNA4(14) U VT)* , t,ti,...,1„
multisets of members of 14, and p E P of the form
given above. Then we have
13A17 13vo Bit iv vn- Bntnv,17
such that t = U:1_1(t1 \ si)U s. JIG is a {}-LIG, L(G) =
lw I S W E
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991117">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999675">
Suppose we want to apply rule p to an instance of
nonterminal A with an index multiset t in a sentential
form. First, we remove the indices in s from t, then we
rewrite the nonterminal, then we distribute the remain-
ing indices freely among the newly introduced nonter-
minals B1, . , B,, creating new multisets, and finally
we add si to the new multiset for each Bi, creating the
new ti.
The reader will have noticed, and hopefully excused,
the abuse of notation in this definition, which results
from mixing set-notation and string-notation. We can
also define {}-LIG as a pure string-rewriting system
which does not require the definition of additional data
structures (the multisets) for the notion of &amp;quot;derivation&amp;quot;
(see (Rambow, 1994)). However, the definition pro-
vided here (using an explicit representation of multi-
sets) has the advantage of corresponding more directly
to the intuition underlying {}-LIG and is much easier
to understand and use in proofs. The issue is purely
notational.
We now introduce a restriction on derivations, which
will be useful later.

We let LR(G) = {w I there is a derivation p :

ER({}-LIG) = {LR(G) Ga {}-LIG}. If G is a {}-LIG
such that LR(G) = L(G), we say that G is linearly
restricted. Many of the results that we will show ap-
ply only to linearly restricted {}-LIGs. However, as we
will see, all linguistic applications will make use of this
restricted version.

<bodyText confidence="0.985913">
We now discuss some formal properties of {}-LIG.
For reasons of space limitation, we only sketch the
proofs; full versions can be found in (Rambow, 1994).
We start with the weak generative power. We have al-
ready seen that {}-LIG can generate languages not in
E(LIG) (and hence not in E(TAG)). We will now show
that linearly restricted {}-LIGs are at most context-
sensitive.
Theorem 3 ER({}-LIG) C E(CSG).
Outline of the proof We simulate a derivation in a
linear bounded automaton. The space needed for this is
bounded linearly in the length of the input word, since
the number of the symbols that are erased, the index
symbols and nonterminals that rewrite to e, is linearly
bounded. •
What sort of languages could a {}-LIG possibly not
generate? Consider the copy language L = {ww I w E
{a, WI, and let us suppose that it is generated by G, a
{}-LIG. This language cannot be generated by a CFG.
We therefore know that for any integer M, there are in-
finitely many strings in L whose derivation in G is such
that at some point, an index multiset in the sentential
form contains more than M index symbols (since any
finite use of index symbols can be simulated by a pure
CFG). It must be the case that this unbounded multiset
is crucial in restricting the second half of the generated
string in such a way that it copies the first half (again,
since a pure CFG cannot derive such strings). However,
it is impossible for a data structure like a (multi-)set
(over a finite index alphabet) to record the required se-
quential information. Therefore, the second half of the
string cannot be adequately constrained, and G cannot
exist. This argument motivates the following conjec-
ture.

We now turn to closure properties.
Theorem 5 £({}-LIG) is a substitution-closed full ab-
stract family of languages (AFL).
Outline of the proof. Since .C({)-LIG) contains all
context-free languages, it contains all regular languages,
and therefore it is sufficient to show that £({}-LIG) is
closed under intersection with regular languages and
substitution. These results are shown by adapting the
techniques used to show the corresponding results for
CFGs. •
Finally, we turn to the recognition and parsing prob-
lem. Again, we will restrict our attention to the linearly
restricted version of {}-LIG.
Theorem 6 Each language in GR({}-LIG) can be rec-
ognized in polynomial deterministic time.
Outline of the proof We extend the CKY parser for
CFG. Let G be a {}-LIG in ETF. Since G may contain
e-productions, the algorithm is adapted by letting the
indices of the matrix refer to positions between sym-
bols in the input string, not the symbols themselves.
In order to account for the index multiset, we let the
entries in the recognition matrix be pairs consisting of
a nonterminal symbol and a I1/21-tuple of integers:
(A, (ni, ...,nivii))
The 1/41-tuple of integers represents a multiset, with
each integer designating the number of copies of a given
index symbol that the set contains. In an entry of
the matrix, each pair represents a partial derivation
of a substring of the input string. More precisely, if
the input word is al • • an , and if V1 = fii, • • •
then we have (A, (ni, nivd)) in entry tij of the
recognition matrix if and only if there is a derivation
As • • •ai, where multiset s contains nk copies
of index symbol ik, 1 &lt; k &lt; Vu. Clearly, there
is a derivation in the grammar if and only if entry
to,n contains the pair (S, (0, • • 0)). Now since the
grammar is linearly restricted, each nk is bounded by
n, and hence the number of different pairs is linearly
bounded by IVNInivil. Thus each entry in the matrix
can be computed in 0(n1+211711) steps, and since there
are 0(n2) entries, we get an overall time complexity of
0(n3+21v11). •

UVG with Dominance Links
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993514043478261">
We now formally define UVG with dominance links
(UVG-DL), which serves as a formal model for the sec-
ond and third phenomena introduced above, word order
variation and quasi-trees. The definition differs from
that of UVG only in that vectors are equipped with
dominance relations which impose an additional condi-
tion on derivations. Note that the definition refers to
the notion of derivation tree of a UVG, which is defined
as for CFG.
Definition 5 An Unordered Vector Grammar
with Dominance Links (UVG-DL) is a 4-tuple
(VN , VT , V,S), where VN and VT are sets of nonter-
minals and terminals, respectively, S is the start sym-
bol, and V is a set of vectors of context-free produc-
tions equipped with dominance links. For a given vec-
tor v E V, the dominance links form a binary relation
dome over the set of occurrences of non-terminals in
the productions of v such that if dom„(A, B), then A
(an instance of a symbol) occurs in the right-hand side
of some production in v, and B is the left-hand symbol
(instance) of some production in v.
If G is a UVG-DL, L(G) consists of all words w E
which have a derivation 0 of the form

2. The dominance relations of V, when interpreted as

The second condition can be formulated as follows:
if v in V contributes instances of productions pi and
7/2 (and perhaps others), and the kth daughter in the
right-hand side of pi dominates the left-hand nonter-
minal of p2, then in the context-free derivation tree as-

the additional constraints that we argued above are nec-
essary to adequately restrict the structural relation be-
tween arguments and their verbs. Furthermore, UVG-
DL is a notational variant of QTSG: every vector rep-
resents a quasi-tree, and identifying quasi-nodes cor-
responds to rewriting. The condition on a successful
derivation in QTSG — that all nonterminal nodes be
identified — corresponds to the definition of a derivation
in UVG-DL. We have therefore found a mathematical

We now turn to the formal properties of UVG-DL.
Our main result is that UVG-DL is weakly equivalent
to {}-LIG. The sets of a {}-LIG implement the domi-
nance links and make sure that all members from one
set of rules are used during a derivation. We first in-
troduce some more terminology with which to describe
the derivations of UVG-DLs. If two productions pv,i
and pv,2 from vector v are linked by a dominance link
from a right-hand side nonterminal of pv,i to the left-
hand nonterminal pv,2, then we will denote this link by
We will say that pv,i (or the right-hand side non-
terminal in question) has a passive dominance require-
ment of 4,1,2, and that Pv2 has an active dominance
requirement of 4,1,2. If pv,i or pv,2 is used in a partial
derivation such that the other production is not used
in the derivation, the dominance requirement (passive
or active) will be called unfulfilled. Let e be a (partial)
derivation. We associate with 0 a multi-set which rep-
resent all the unfulfilled active dominance requirements
of e, written T(0).

Based on word-order facts from Turkish, Hoffman
(1992) proposes an extension to CCG called {}-CCG, in
which arguments of functors form sets, rather than be-
ing represented in a curried notation. Under function
composition, these sets are unioned. Thus the move
from CCG to {}-CCG corresponds very much to the
move from LIG to {}-LIG. We conjecture that (a ver-
sion of) {}-CCG is weakly equivalent to {}-LIG.
Staudacher (1993) defines a related system called dis-
tributed index grammar or DIG. DIG is like LIG, except
that the stack of index symbols can be split into chunks
and distributed among the daughter nodes. However,
the formalism is not convincingly motivated by the lin-
guistic data given (which can also be handled by a sim-
ple LIG) or by other considerations.
Several extensions to {}-LIG and UVG-DL are de-
fined in (Rambow, 1994). First, we can introduce the
&amp;quot;integrity&amp;quot; constraint suggested by Becker et al. (1991)
which restricts long-distance relations through nodes.
This is necessary to implement the linguistic notion of
&amp;quot;barrier&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;island&amp;quot;. Second, we can define the tree-
rewriting version of UVG-DL, called V-TAG. This is
motivated by Conjecture 4, which (if true) means that
UVG-DL cannot derive Swiss German. Under either ex-
tension, the weak generative power is extended, but the
formal and computational results obtained for {}-LIG
and UVG-DL still hold.

This paper has presented two equivalent formalisms,
{}-LIG and UVG-DL, which provide formal models for
the three different phenomena that we identified in the
beginning of the paper. We have shown that both for-
malisms, under certain restrictions that are compati-
ble with the motivating phenomena, are restricted in
their generative capacity and polynomially parsable,
thus making them attractive candidates for modeling
natural language. Furthermore, the formalisms are
substitution-closed AFLs, suggesting that the defini-
tions we have given are &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; from the point of
view of formal language theory.

<abstract confidence="0.991819208333334">While LIG-equivalent formalisms have been shown to provide adequate formal power for a wide range of linguistic phenomena (including the aforementioned Swiss German construction), the need for other mathematical formalisms has arisen in several unrelated areas. In this paper, we discuss three such cases. First, capturing several semantic and syntactic issues in unificationbased formalisms leads to the use of multiset-valued feature structures. Second, word order facts from languages such as German, Russian, or Turkish cannot be derived by LIG-equivalent formalisms. Third, a generalization of trees to &amp;quot;quasi-trees&amp;quot; (Vijay-Shanker, 1992) in the spirit of D-Theory (Marcus et al., 1983) leads to the definition of a new formal system. In this paper, we introduce two new equivalent mathematical formalisms which provide adequate descriptions for these three phenomena. The paper is structured as follows. First, we present the three phenomena in more detail. We then introduce multiset-valued LIG and present some formal properties. Thereafter, we introduce a second rewriting system and show that it is weakly equivalent to the LIG variant. We then briefly mention some related formalisms. We conclude with a brief summary. Three Problems for LIG-Equivalent Formalisms The three problems we present are of a rather different nature. The first arises from the way a linguistic problem is treated in a specific type of framework (unification-based formalisms). The second problem derives directly from linguistic data. The third problem is a formalism which has been motivated on independent, methodological grounds, but whose formal properties are unknown. Feature Structures HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987; Pollard and Sag, 1994) uses typed feature structures as its formal basis, which are Turing-equivalent. However, it is not necessarily Abstract This paper defines multiset-valued linear index grammar and unordered vector grammar with dominance links. The former models certain uses of multisetvalued feature structures in unification-based formalisms, while the latter is motivated by word order variation and by &amp;quot;quasi-trees&amp;quot;, a generalization of trees. The two formalisms are weakly equivalent, and an important subset is at most context-sensitive and polynomially parsable.</abstract>

It can easily be seen from the construction employed in the proof of Theorem 7 that a lexicalized UVG-DL maps to a linearly restricted {}-LIG. For linguistic purposes we are only interested in lexicalized grammars, and therefore the linear restriction is quite natural. We obtain the following corollaries thanks to Theorem 7. Corollary 8 C(UVG-DLLe.) C .C(CSG). Corollary 9 G(UVG-DL) is a substitution-closed full AFL. Corollary 10 Each language in .C(UVG-DLL,) can be recognized in polynomial deterministic time. Related Formalisms Based on word-order facts from Turkish, Hoffman (1992) proposes an extension to CCG called {}-CCG, in which arguments of functors form sets, rather than being represented in a curried notation. Under function composition, these sets are unioned. Thus the move from CCG to {}-CCG corresponds very much to the move from LIG to {}-LIG. We conjecture that (a version of) {}-CCG is weakly equivalent to {}-LIG. Staudacher (1993) defines a related system called distributed index grammar or DIG.

Clearly this would represent an important insight into the nature of grammatical competence. On the practical side, formal equivalences can guide the building of applications such as parsers for existing HPSG grammars. For example, it has been proposed that HPSG grammars can be &amp;quot;compiled&amp;quot; into TAGs in order to obtain a computationally more tractable system (Kasper, 1992), thus sidestepping the issue of building parsers for HPSG directly. However, LIG-equivalent formalisms cannot serve as targets for compilations in cases in which HPSG uses multiset-valued feature structures. Word Order Variation Becker et al. (1991) discuss scrambling, which is the permutation of verbal arguments in languages such as German, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Russian, and Turkish.

In this paper, we discuss three such cases. First, capturing several semantic and syntactic issues in unificationbased formalisms leads to the use of multiset-valued feature structures. Second, word order facts from languages such as German, Russian, or Turkish cannot be derived by LIG-equivalent formalisms. Third, a generalization of trees to &amp;quot;quasi-trees&amp;quot; (Vijay-Shanker, 1992) in the spirit of D-Theory (Marcus et al., 1983) leads to the definition of a new formal system. In this paper, we introduce two new equivalent mathematical formalisms which provide adequate descriptions for these three phenomena. The paper is structured as follows. First, we present the three phenomena in more detail. We then introduce multiset-valued LIG and present some formal properties. Thereafter, we introduce a second rewriting system and show that it is weakly equivalent to the LIG variant. We then briefly mention some related formalisms. We conclude with a brief summary.

The reader will have noticed, and hopefully excused, the abuse of notation in this definition, which results from mixing set-notation and string-notation. We can also define {}-LIG as a pure string-rewriting system which does not require the definition of additional data structures (the multisets) for the notion of &amp;quot;derivation&amp;quot; (see (Rambow, 1994)). However, the definition provided here (using an explicit representation of multisets) has the advantage of corresponding more directly to the intuition underlying {}-LIG and is much easier to understand and use in proofs. The issue is purely notational. We now introduce a restriction on derivations, which will be useful later.

DIG is like LIG, except that the stack of index symbols can be split into chunks and distributed among the daughter nodes. However, the formalism is not convincingly motivated by the linguistic data given (which can also be handled by a simple LIG) or by other considerations. Several extensions to {}-LIG and UVG-DL are defined in (Rambow, 1994). First, we can introduce the &amp;quot;integrity&amp;quot; constraint suggested by Becker et al. (1991) which restricts long-distance relations through nodes. This is necessary to implement the linguistic notion of &amp;quot;barrier&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;island&amp;quot;. Second, we can define the treerewriting version of UVG-DL, called V-TAG. This is motivated by Conjecture 4, which (if true) means that UVG-DL cannot derive Swiss German. Under either extension, the weak generative power is extended, but the formal and computational results obtained for {}-LIG and UVG-DL still hold. Conclusion This paper has presented two equivalent formalisms,</context>

The two formalisms are weakly equivalent, and an important subset is at most context-sensitive and polynomially parsable. Introduction Early attempts to use context-free grammars (CFGs) as a mathematical model for natural language syntax have largely been abandoned; it has been shown that (under standard assumptions concerning the recursive nature of clausal embedding) the cross-serial dependencies found in Swiss German cannot be generated by a CFG (Shieber, 1985). Several mathematical models have been proposed which extend the formal power of CFGs, while still maintaining the formal properties that make CFGs attractive formalisms for formal and computational linguists, in particular, polynomial parsability and restricted weak generative capacity. These mathematical models include tree adjoining grammar (TAG) (Joshi et al., 1975; Joshi, 1985), head grammar (Pollard, 1984), combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 1985), and linear index grammar (LIG) (Gazdar, 1988).

Corollary 10 Each language in .C(UVG-DLL,) can be recognized in polynomial deterministic time. Related Formalisms Based on word-order facts from Turkish, Hoffman (1992) proposes an extension to CCG called {}-CCG, in which arguments of functors form sets, rather than being represented in a curried notation. Under function composition, these sets are unioned. Thus the move from CCG to {}-CCG corresponds very much to the move from LIG to {}-LIG. We conjecture that (a version of) {}-CCG is weakly equivalent to {}-LIG. Staudacher (1993) defines a related system called distributed index grammar or DIG. DIG is like LIG, except that the stack of index symbols can be split into chunks and distributed among the daughter nodes. However, the formalism is not convincingly motivated by the linguistic data given (which can also be handled by a simple LIG) or by other considerations. Several extensions to {}-LIG and UVG-DL are defined in (Rambow, 1994). First, we can introduce the &amp;quot;integrity&amp;quot; constraint suggested by Becker et al.

In this paper, we discuss three such cases. First, capturing several semantic and syntactic issues in unificationbased formalisms leads to the use of multiset-valued feature structures. Second, word order facts from languages such as German, Russian, or Turkish cannot be derived by LIG-equivalent formalisms. Third, a generalization of trees to &amp;quot;quasi-trees&amp;quot; (Vijay-Shanker, 1992) in the spirit of D-Theory (Marcus et al., 1983) leads to the definition of a new formal system. In this paper, we introduce two new equivalent mathematical formalisms which provide adequate descriptions for these three phenomena. The paper is structured as follows. First, we present the three phenomena in more detail. We then introduce multiset-valued LIG and present some formal properties. Thereafter, we introduce a second rewriting system and show that it is weakly equivalent to the LIG variant. We then briefly mention some related formalisms. We conclude with a brief summary.

Quasi-Trees Vijay-Shanker (1992) introduces &amp;quot;quasi-trees&amp;quot; as a generalization of trees. He starts from the observation that the traditional definition of tree adjoining gram264 mar (TAG) is incompatible with a unification-based approach because the trees of a TAG start out as fully specified objects, which are later modified; in particular, immediate dominance relations in a tree need not hold after another tree is adjoined into it. In order to arrive at a definition that is compatible with a unificationbased approach, he makes three minimal assumptions about the nature of the objects used for the representation of natural l</context>

Bottom quasinodes immediately dominate top quasi-nodes of other quasi-node pairs, and each top quasi-node is immediately dominated by exactly one bottom quasi-node. For simplicity, we will assume that there is only a bottom root quasi-node (i.e., no top root quasi-node), and that bottom frontier quasi-nodes are omitted (i.e., frontier nodes just consist of top quasi-nodes). Furthermore, we will assume that each quasi-node has a label, and is equipped with a finite feature structure. A sample quasi-tree is shown in Figure 1 (quasi-tree ot5 of VijayShanker (1992, p.488)). We follow Vijay-Shanker (1992, Section 2.5) in defining substitution as the operation of forming a quasi-node pair from a frontier node of one tree (which becomes the top node) and the root node of another tree (which becomes the bottom node). As always, a dominance link relates the two quasi-nodes of the newly formed pair. Adjunction is not defined separately: it suffices to say that a pair of quasi-nodes is &amp;quot;broken up&amp;quot;, thus forming two quasi-trees. We then perform two substitutions. Observe that nothing keeps us from breaking up more than one pair of quasi-nodes in either of two quasi-trees, and then performing more th</context>

The string associated with this quasi-tree is defined in the usual way. We have now fully defined a formalism (if informally): its data structures (quasi-trees), its combination operation (substitution), and the notion of derived structure. We will call this formalism Quasi-Tree Substitution Grammar (QTSG). It can easily be seen that all examples discussed by Vijay-Shanker (1992) are derivations in QTSG. The question arises as to the formal and computational properties of QTSG. Multiset-Valued LIG In order to find a mathematical model for certain uses of multiset-valued feature structures, discussed above, we now introduce a multiset-valued variant of LIG. We denote by M(A) the set of multisets over the elements of A, and we use the standard set notation to refer to the corresponding multiset operations.
