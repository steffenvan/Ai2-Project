Named Entities play a significant role in Natural Language Processing and Information
Retrieval. While identifying and analyzing named entities in a given natural language is a
challenging research problem by itself, the phenomenal growth in the Internet user
population, especially among the non-English speaking parts of the world, has extended this
problem to the crosslingual arena. This is the specific research focus for the Named Entities
WorkShop (NEWS), being held as a part of ACL-IJCNLP 2009 conference.
The purpose of the NEWS workshop is to bring together researchers across the world
interested in identification, analysis, extraction, mining and transformation of named entities
in monolingual or multilingual natural language text. Under such broad scope as above, many
interesting specific research areas pertaining to the named entities are identified, such as,
orthographic and phonetic characteristics, corpus analysis, unsupervised and supervised
named entities extraction in monolingual or multilingual corpus, transliteration modelling,
and evaluation methodologies, to name a few. 17 research papers were submitted, each of
which was reviewed by at least 3 reviewers from the program committee. Finally, 9 papers
were chosen for publication, covering main research areas, from named entities tagging and
extraction, to computational phonology to machine transliteration of named entities. All
accepted research papers are published in the workshop proceedings.
An important part of the NEWS workshop is the shared task on Machine Transliteration of
named entities. Machine transliteration is a vibrant research area as witnessed by increasing
number of publications over the last decade in the Computational Linguistics, Natural
Language Processing (ACL, EACL, NAACL, IJCNLP, COLING, HLT, EMNLP, etc.), and
Information Retrieval (SIGIR, ECIR, AIRS, etc.) conferences, and primarily in languages
that use non-Latin based scripts. However, in spite of its popularity, no meaningful
comparison could be possible between the research approaches, as the publications tended to
be on different language pairs and different datasets, and on a variety of different metrics. For
the first time, we organize a shared task as part of the NEWS workshop to provide a common
evaluation platform for benchmarking and calibration of transliteration technologies.
We collected significantly large, hand-crafted parallel named entities corpora in 7 different
languages from 6 language families, and made available as common dataset for the shared
task. We defined 6 metrics that are language-independent, intuitive and computationally easy
to compute. We published the details of the shared task and the training and development
data six months ahead of the conference that attracted an overwhelming response from the
research community. Totally 31 teams participated from around the world, including
industry, government laboratories and academia. The approaches ranged from traditional
unsupervised learning methods (such as, naive-Bayes, Phrasal SMT-based, Conditional
Random Fields, etc.) to somewhat unique approaches (such as, sequence prediction models,
to Minimum Description Length-based methods, etc.), combined with several model
combinations for results re-ranking. While every team submitted standard runs that use only
the data provided by the NEWS organizers, many teams also submitted non-standard runs
where they were allowed to use any additional data or language specific modules. In total,
about 190 task runs were submitted, covering most approaches comprehensively. A report of
the shared task that summarizes all submissions and the original whitepaper are also included
in the proceedings, and will be presented in the workshop. The participants in the shared task
were asked to submit short system papers (4 pages each) describing their approach, and each
iii
of such papers was reviewed by at least two members of the program committee; 27 of them
were finally are accepted to publish in the workshop proceedings.
NEWS 2009 is the first workshop that specifically addresses comprehensively all research
avenues concerned with named entities, to the best of our knowledge. Also, the transliteration
shared task is the first of its kind, to calibrate such large number of systems using common
metrics on common language-specific datasets in a comprehensive set of language pairs.
We hope that NEWS 2009 would provide an exciting and productive forum for researchers
working in this research area. The technical programme includes 9 research papers and 27
system papers to be presented in the workshop. Further, we are pleased to have invited Dr
Kevin Knight to deliver a keynote speech in the workshop. Dr Knight is a well-known
researcher in natural language processing, an Associate Professor at University of Southern
California, and the Founder and Chief Scientist of Language Weaver, a human
communication solutions company.
We wish to thank all the researchers for their research submission and the enthusiastic
participation in the transliteration shared task. We wish to express our gratitude for the data
providers (CJK Institute, Institute for Infocomm Research and Microsoft Research India) for
the shared task. Finally, we thank all the programme committee members for reviewing the
submissions in spite of the tight schedule.

In total, about 190 task runs were submitted, covering most approaches comprehensively. A report of the shared task that summarizes all submissions and the original whitepaper are also included in the proceedings, and will be presented in the workshop. The participants in the shared task were asked to submit short system papers (4 pages each) describing their approach, and each iii of such papers was reviewed by at least two members of the program committee; 27 of them were finally are accepted to publish in the workshop proceedings. NEWS 2009 is the first workshop that specifically addresses comprehensively all research avenues concerned with named entities, to the best of our knowledge. Also, the transliteration shared task is the first of its kind, to calibrate such large number of systems using common metrics on common language-specific datasets in a comprehensive set of language pairs. We hope that NEWS 2009 would provide an exciting and productive forum for researchers working in this research area. The technical programme includes 9 research papers and 27 system papers to be presented in the workshop. Further, we are pleased</context>
