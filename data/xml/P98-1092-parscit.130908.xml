Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999819055555556">
After extracting terms from a corpus of titles and
abstracts in English, syntactic variation relations
are identified amongst them in order to detect
research topics. Three types of syntactic variations
were studied : permutation, expansion and
substitution. These syntactic variations yield other
relations of formal and conceptual nature. Basing
on a distinction of the variation relations
according to the grammatical function affected in
a term - head or modifier - term variants are first
clustered into connected components which are in
turn clustered into classes. These classes relate
two or more components through variations
involving a change of head word, thus of topic.
The graph obtained reveals the global organisation
of research topics in the corpus. A clustering
method has been built to compute such classes of
research topics.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881901960784">
The importance of terms in various natural
language tasks such as automatic indexing,
computer-aided translation, information retrieval
and technology watch need no longer be proved.
Terms are meaningful textual units used for
naming concepts or objects in a given field. Past
studies have focused on building term extraction
tools : TERMINO (David S. &amp; Plante P. 1991),
LEXTER (Bourigault D. 1994), ACABIT (Daille
1994), FASTR (Jacquemin 1995), TERMS (Katz
S.M. &amp; Justeson T.S. 1995). Here, term extraction
and the identification of syntactic variation
relations are considered for topic detection.
Variations are changes affecting the structure and
the form of a term producing another textual unit
close to the initial one e.g. dna amplification and
amplification fingerprinting of dna. Variations can
point to terminological evolution and thus to that
of the underlying concept. Topic is used in its
grammatical sense, i.e. the head word in a noun
phrase. In the above term, fingerprinting is the
topic (head word) and dna amplification its
properties (modifiers). However, a topic cannot
appear by chance in specialised litterature, so this
grammatical definition needs to be backed up by
empirical evidence such as recurrence of terms
sharing the same head word. We constituted a test
corpus of scientific abstracts and titles in English
from the field of plant biotechnology making up
,-:-_-.29000 words. These texts covered publications
made over 13 years (1981-1993). We focused on
three syntactic variation types occurring
frequently amongst terms : permutation,
substitution and expansion (§2). Tzoukermann E.
Klavans J. and Jacquemin C. (1997) extracted
morpho-syntactic term variants for NLP tasks such
as automatic indexing. They accounted for a wide
spectrum of variation producing phenomena like
the morpho-syntactic variation involving
derivation in tree cutting and trees have been cut
down&apos;.
We focused for the moment on terms appearing as
noun phrases (NP). Although term variants can
appear as verb phrases (VP), we believe that NP
variants reflect more terminological stability thus
a real shift in topic (root hair —4 root hair
deformation) than their VP counterpart (root hair
—&gt; the root hair appears deformed). Also, our
application - research topic identification - being
quite sensitive, requires a careful selection of term
variants types depending on their interpretability.

This is to avoid creating relations between terms
which could mislead the end-user, typically a
technological watcher, in his task. For instance
how do we interpret the relation between concept
class and class concept ? Also, our aim is not to
extract syntactic variants per se but to identify
them in order to establish meaningful relations
between them.

1 Extracting terms from texts
1.1 Morpho-syntactic features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979673076923">
Term extraction is based on their morpho-
syntactic features. The morphological composition
of NP terms allows for a limited number of
categories mostly nouns, adjectives and some
prepositions. Terms can appear under two
syntactic structures : compound (the specific
alfalfa nodulation) or syntagmatic (the specific
nodulation of alfalfa). Since terms are used for
naming concepts and objects in a given knowledge
field, they tend to be relatively short textual units
usually between 2-4 words though terms of longer
length occur (endogeneous duck hepatitis B virus).
In this study, we fixed a word limit of 7 not
considering determiners and prepositions.
Based on these three features, morphological
make-up, syntactic structure and length, clauses
are processed in order to extract complex terms
rather than atomic ones. The motivation behind
this approach is that complex terms reveal the
association of concepts, hence they are more
relevant for the application we are considering. A
fine-grained term extraction strategy would isolate
the concepts and thus lose the information given
by their associations in the corpus. For this reason,
we could not consider the use of an existing term
extraction tool and thus had to carry out a manual
simulation of the term extraction phase. NP
splitting rules take into account the lexical nature
of the constituent words and their raising
properties (i.e. derived nouns as opposed to non-
derived ones). Furthermore, following the
empirical approach successfully implemented by
Bourigault (1994), we split complex NPs only
after a search has been performed in the corpus for
occurrences of their sub-segments in unambiguous
situations, i.e. when the sub-segments are not
included in a larger segment. This favours the
extraction of pre-conceived textual units possibly
corresponding to domain terms. However morpho-
syntactic features alone cannot verify the
terminological status of the units extracted since
they can also select non terms (see Smadja 1993).
For instance root nodulation is a term in the plant
biotechnology field whereas book review also
found in the corpus is not. Thus in the first stage,
the terms extracted are only plausible candidates
which need to be filtered in order to eliminate the
most unlikely ones. This filtering takes advantage
of lexical information accessible at our level of
analysis to fine-tune the statistical occurrence
criterion which used alone, inevitably leads to a
massive elimination.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998902">
1.2 Splitting complex noun phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999816677419355">
An NP is deemed complex if its morpho-syntactic
features do not conform to that specified for terms,
e.g. oxygen control of nitrogen fixation gene
expression in bradyrhizobium japonicum a title
found in our corpus. Its corresponding syntactic
context is : NPI_of_NP2_prep1_NP3 where NP is a
recognised noun phrase, prep&apos; refers to the class of
preposition not containing of and often found in
the morphological composition of terms (for, by,
in, from, with). Normally, exploiting syntactic
information on the raising properties of the head
noun (control) and following the distributional
approach, the above segment will be split thus:
But this splitting is only performed if no sub-
segment of the initial one occurred alone in the
corpus. This search yielded nitrogen fixation gene
expression and bradyrhizobium japonicum which
both occurred more than 6 times in the corpus.
Their existence confirms the relevance of our
splitting rule which would have yielded the same
result: oxygen control; nitrogen fixation gene
expression; bradyrhizobium japonicum
Altogether, 4463 candidate terms were extracted
from our corpus and subjected to a filtering
process which combined lexical and statistical
criteria. The lexical criterion consisted in
eliminating terms that contained a determiner
other than the that remained after the splitting
phase. Only this determiner can occur in a term as
it has the capacity, out of context, to refer to a
concept or object in a knowledge field, i.e. the use

<bodyText confidence="0.999970466666667">
of the variant the low-line instead of the full term
low fertility droughtmaster line2. The statistical
criterion consisted in eliminating terms starting
with the and appearing only once. These two
criteria enabled us to eliminate 30% (1304)
candidates and to retain 70% (3159) which we
consider to be likely terminological units. We are
aware that this filtering procedure remains
approximate and cannot eliminate bad candidates
like book review whose morphological and lexical
make-up correspond to those of terms. But we also
observe that such bad candidates are naturally
filtered out in later stages as they rarely possess
variants and thus will not appear as research topics
(see §4).

2 Identifying syntactic variants
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991475">
Given the two syntactic structures under which a
term can appear - compound or syntagmatic - we
first pre-processed the terms by transforming those
in a syntagmatic structure into their compound
version. This transformation is based on the
following noun phrase formation rule for English:
DAMI hpmM2--&gt;DAmM2M, h
where D, A and M are respectively strings of
determiner, adjective and words whose place can
be empty, h is a head noun, m is a word and p is a
preposition. Thus, the compound version of the
specific nodulation of alfalfa will give the specific
alfalfa nodulation. This transformation does not
modify the original structure under which a term
occurred in the corpus. It only serves to furnish
input data to the syntactic variation identification
programs. This transformation which is equivalent
to permutation (§2.1) is the linguistic relation
which once accounted for, reveals the formal
nature of the other types of syntactic variations.
Also, it enables us to detect variants in the two
syntactic structures thus accounting for syntactic
variants such as defined in Tzoukermann et al.
(1997). In what follows, t1 and t2 are terms.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993585">
2.1 Permutation (Perm)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999762">
It marks the transformation of a term, from a
syntagmatic structure to a compound one:

/2 = A m M2 N M1 h

<bodyText confidence="0.99988075">
where ti is really found in the corpus, N is a string
of words that is either empty or a noun. 37 terms
were concerned by this relation. Some examples
are given in Table 1.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998394">
2.2 Substitution (Sub)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996685">
It marks the replacing of a component word in t
by another word in t2 in terms of equal length.
Only one word can be replaced and at the same
position to ensure the interpretability of the
relation. We distinguished between modifier and
head substitution.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9916846">
• Modifier substitution (M-Sub) :
t2 is a substitution of t1 if and only if:
= M1 m M2 h and t2 = Mi m&apos; M2 h

<bodyText confidence="0.9989306">
Tzoukermann et al. (1997) considered chemical
treatment against disease and disease treatment as
substitution variants whereas, in our study, after
transformation, they would be a case of left-
expansion (L-Exp). Examples of head and
modifier substitutions are given in Table 2. 1543
terms shared substitution relations : 1084 in the
modifier substitution and 872 in the head
substitution. The same term can occur in both
categories.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992632">
2.3 Expansion (Exp)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999716833333333">
Expansion is the generic name designating three
elementary operations of word adjunction in an
existing term. Word adjunction can occur in three
positions : left, right or within. Thus we have left
expansion, right expansion and insertion
respectively.

<listItem confidence="0.991388">
• Left expansion (L-Exp) :
t2 is a left-expansion of t1 if and only if:
ti = M h and t2 = M&apos; m&apos; M h

t2 is a right-expansion of ti if and only if:
= M h and t2 = M h M&apos; h&apos;
• Insertion (Ins) :

<bodyText confidence="0.999830583333333">
Examples of each sub-type of expansion are given
in Table 3.
Some terms combine the two types of expansion -
left and right expansions (noted LR-Exp), for
example root of bragg —&gt; root exudate of
soyabean cultivar bragg. These complex
expansion variants were also identified. A total of
1014 terms were involved in the expansion
variation relations. Altogether, 82% (2593 out of
3159) terms were involved in the three types of
syntactic variations studied showing the
importance of the phenomena amongst terms.

Syntactic variations yield conceptual relations

Substitution (Sub) engenders a relation between
term variants which can be qualified as &amp;quot;class_or.
Modifier substitution groups properties around the
same concept class : template dna, genomic dna,
target dna are properties associated to the class of
concept named &amp;quot;dna&amp;quot;. Head substitution groups
concepts or objects around a class of property:
dna fragment, dna sequence, dna fingerprinting
are concepts associated to the class of property
named dna. This relation does not imply a
hierarchy amongst terms thus somehow reflecting
the symmetrical relation engendered on the formal
level.

• Generic / specific
Expansion, all sub-types considered, engenders a
generic/specific relation between terms which
echoes the antisymmetrical relation observed on
the formal level. Expansion thus introduces a
hierarchy amongst terms and allows us to
construct paradigms that may correspond to
families of concepts or objects (R-Exp, LR-Exp)
or families of properties (L-Exp, Ins). Jacquemin
(1995) reported similar conceptual relations for
insertion and coordination variants.

4 Identifying topics organisation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999792509803922">
We built a novel clustering method -
Classification by Preferential Clustered Link
(CPCL) - to cluster terms into classes of research
topics. First we distinguished two categories of
variation relations : those affecting modifier words
noted COMP (M-Sub, L-Exp, Ins) and those
affecting the head word noted CLAS (H-Sub, LR-
Exp, R-Exp).
The need to value the variation relations may arise
if a type (symmetrical or antisymmetrical) is in the
minority. To preserve the information it carries, a
default value is fixed for this minority type. The
value of the majority type is then calculated as its
proportion with regard to the minority type. In our
corpus, Exp (antisymmetrical) relations were in
minority compared to Sub (symmetrical relations).
Their default value was set at 1. The value of Sub
relations was then given by the ratio Exp/Sub
where Exp (respectively Sub) is the total number
of expansions relations (respectively substitutions)
between terms in the corpus. This valuing of
variation relations highlights a type of information
that would otherwise be drowned but is not a
mandatory condition for the clustering algorithm
to work.
COMP relations structure term variants around the
same head word thus forming components
representing the paradigms in the corpus. These
paradigms typically correspond to isolated topics
(see Table 4 hereafter). The strength of the link
between two components Pi and Pj is given by the
sum of the value of variation relations between
them. More formally, we define the COMP
relation between terms as : ti COMP ti iff t, and tj
share the same head word and if one is the variant
of the other. The transitive closure COMP* of
COMP partitions the whole set of terms into
components. These components are not isolated
and are linked by transversal CLAS relations
implying a change of head word, thus bringing to
light the associations between research topics in
the corpus.
CLAS relations cluster components basing on the
following principle : two components Pi and Pi
are clustered if the link between them is stronger
than the link between either of them and any other
component Pk which has not been clustered
neither with Pi nor with P. We call classification,
a partition of terms in such classes. An efficient
algorithm has been implemented in Ibekwe-
SanJuan (1997) which seeks growing series of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994554">

<bodyText confidence="0.981548181818182">
such classifications. These series represent more
or less fine-grained structurings of the corpus. A
more formal description of the CPCL method can
be found in Ibekwe-SanJuan (1998).
Table 4 shows a component and a class.
The component formed around the head word hair
reveals the properties (modifiers) associated with
this topic but does not tell us anything about its
association other topics. The class on the other
hand reveals the association of hair with other
topics.

research topics in the corpus. Classes like 12, 3

class which could indicate privileged thematic
relations. The unique link between class 3 and 19
is explained by the fact that 3 represented an
emerging topic4 at the time the corpus was
constituted (1993) : the research done around a
new gene type (the klebsiella pneumoniae nifb
gene). So it was relevant that this class be strongly
linked to class 19 without being central. Also,
class 10 represented an emerging topic in 1993 :
the research for retrotransposable elements which
enables the passing from one gene to another.

Concluding remarks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999899411764706">
Syntactic variation relations are promising
linguistic phenomena for tracking topic evolution
in texts. However, being that clustering is based
on syntactic variation relations, the CPCL method
cannot detect topics related through semantic or
pragmatic relations. For instance, the topic
depicted by class 8 (glycine max) should have
been related to topic 20 (lucerne plant) from a
semantic viewpoint. Their separation was caused
by the absence of syntactic variations between the
constituent terms. Such relations can be brought to
light only if further knowledge (semantic) is
incorporated into the relations used for clustering.
In the future, we will test our clustering method on
another corpus of a larger size and extend our
study to other variation phenomena as possible
topic shifting devices.

<abstract confidence="0.998230210526316">After extracting terms from a corpus of titles and abstracts in English, syntactic variation relations are identified amongst them in order to detect research topics. Three types of syntactic variations were studied : permutation, expansion and substitution. These syntactic variations yield other relations of formal and conceptual nature. Basing on a distinction of the variation relations according to the grammatical function affected in a term head or modifier term variants are first clustered into connected components which are in turn clustered into classes. These classes relate two or more components through variations involving a change of head word, thus of topic. The graph obtained reveals the global organisation of research topics in the corpus. A clustering method has been built to compute such classes of research topics.</abstract>

A fine-grained term extraction strategy would isolate the concepts and thus lose the information given by their associations in the corpus. For this reason, we could not consider the use of an existing term extraction tool and thus had to carry out a manual simulation of the term extraction phase. NP splitting rules take into account the lexical nature of the constituent words and their raising properties (i.e. derived nouns as opposed to nonderived ones). Furthermore, following the empirical approach successfully implemented by Bourigault (1994), we split complex NPs only after a search has been performed in the corpus for occurrences of their sub-segments in unambiguous situations, i.e. when the sub-segments are not included in a larger segment. This favours the extraction of pre-conceived textual units possibly corresponding to domain terms. However morphosyntactic features alone cannot verify the terminological status of the units extracted since they can also select non terms (see Smadja 1993). For instance root nodulation is a term in the plant biotechnology field whereas book review also found in the corpus is not. Thus in the </context>

CLAS relations cluster components basing on the following principle : two components Pi and Pi are clustered if the link between them is stronger than the link between either of them and any other component Pk which has not been clustered neither with Pi nor with P. We call classification, a partition of terms in such classes. An efficient algorithm has been implemented in IbekweSanJuan (1997) which seeks growing series of 568 such classifications. These series represent more or less fine-grained structurings of the corpus. A more formal description of the CPCL method can be found in Ibekwe-SanJuan (1998). Table 4 shows a component and a class.

The results obtained can support scientific and technological watch activities. Concluding remarks Syntactic variation relations are promising linguistic phenomena for tracking topic evolution in texts. However, being that clustering is based on syntactic variation relations, the CPCL method cannot detect topics related through semantic or pragmatic relations. For instance, the topic depicted by class 8 (glycine max) should have been related to topic 20 (lucerne plant) from a semantic viewpoint. Their separation was caused by the absence of syntactic variations between the constituent terms.</context>

Expansion thus introduces a hierarchy amongst terms and allows us to construct paradigms that may correspond to families of concepts or objects (R-Exp, LR-Exp) or families of properties (L-Exp, Ins). Jacquemin (1995) reported similar conceptual relations for insertion and coordination variants. 4 Identifying topics organisation We built a novel clustering method - Classification by Preferential Clustered Link (CPCL) - to cluster terms into classes of research topics. First we distinguished two categories of variation relations : those affecting modifier words noted COMP (M-Sub, L-Exp, Ins) and those affecting the head word noted CLAS (H-Sub, LRExp, R-Exp). The need to value the variation relations may arise if a type (symmetrical or antisymmetrical) is in the minority. To preserve the information it carri</context>
