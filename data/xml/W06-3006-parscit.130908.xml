In this paper, we propose ellipsis han-
dling method for follow-up questions in
Information Access Dialogue (IAD) task
of NTCIR QAC3. In this method, our sys-
tem classifies ellipsis patterns of question
sentences into three types and recognizes
elliptical elements using ellipsis handling
algorithm for each type. In the evalua-
tion using Formal Run and Reference Run
data, there were several cases which our
algorithm could not handle ellipsis cor-
rectly. According to the analysis of evalu-
ation results, the main reason of low per-
formance was lack of word information
for recognition of referential elements. If
our system can recognize word meanings
correctly, some errors will not occur and
ellipsis handling works well.

In question answering task QAC of NTCIR (Kato
et al., 2005)(Kato et al., 2004), interactive use of
question answering is proposed as one of evaluation
task called Information Access Dialogue (IAD) task,
which was called subtask3 in QAC1,2. In IAD task,
a set of question consists of one first question and
several follow-up questions. These series of ques-
tions and answers comprise an information access
dialogue. In QAC1, there was only one follow-up
question in a series of questions, but in QAC2 and 3
there were several follow-up questions.
All follow-up questions have anaphoric expres-
sions including zero anaphora which is frequently
occurs in Japanese. There were several approaches
to answer follow-up questions. One approach was
to extract answers of follow-up questions from doc-
uments which were retrieved using clue words of the
first question (Sasaki et al., 2002). In the other ap-
proach, they added clue words extracted from the
previous questions to clue words of follow-up ques-
tion for document retrieval (Murata et al., 2002).
However, when topic was changed in a series of
questions, these approaches did not work well be-
cause clue words of the previous questions were
not always effective to extract answer of the current
question.
Our approach is to handle ellipses of follow-up
questions and apply the processed questions to ordi-
nary question answering system which extracts an-
swers of a question (Fukumoto et al., 2002)(Fuku-
moto et al., 2004)(Matsuda and Fukumoto, 2005).
For QAC3, we have improved our previous approach
to handle follow-up questions, that is, we have ex-
panded ellipsis handling rules more precisely. Based
on the analysis of evaluation results of QAC2, we
have classified ellipsis pattern of question sentences
into three types. The first type is ellipsis using pro-
noun. This is the case that a word used in previ-
ous questions is replaced with pronoun. The second
type is ellipsis of word in verb’s obligatory case el-
ements in the follow-up question. Some obligatory
case elements of a verb of a follow-up question will
be omitted and such elements also used in the previ-
ous question. The last type is ellipsis of a modifier
or modificand in a follow-up question. Such an ele-

ment appears in the previous question and has mod-
ification relationship with some word in the follow-
up question sentence. In order to handle the above
three ellipsis types, we utilized case information of
main verb of a question and co-occurrence of nouns
to recognize which case information is omitted. We
used co-occurrence dictionary which was developed
by Japan Electric Dictionary Research Inc. (EDR)
(EDR, ).
As for core QA system which is our main ques-
tion answering system, we have integrated previous
systems modules which are developed for QAC2.
One module is to handle numeric type questions. It
analyzes co-occurrence data of unit expression and
their object names and detects an appropriate nu-
meric type. Another module uses detailed classifica-
tion of Named Entity for non numerical type ques-
tions such as person name, organization name and so
on to extract an answer element of a given question.
In the following sections, we will show the de-
tails of analysis of elliptical question sentences and
our new method of ellipsis handling. We will also
discuss our system evaluation on ellipsis handling.

<bodyText confidence="0.99987575">
In this pattern, an obligatory case element verb in
follow-up question is omitted, and the omitted el-
ement refers an element or answer of the previous
question. An example of this pattern is as follows:

and “goal”, and the elements of each case frame are
omitted. The element of “agent” is the answer of
Ex3-1, and the element of “goal” is “ (the
President)” of Ex3-1. Therefore, Ex3-2 should be
“(the answer of Ex3-1)

This pattern is the case of ellipsis of modifier. When
there is modification relation between two words of
a question, either of them (modifying element or the
modified element) modifies an element of the next
question but is omitted. We call the modifying el-

modificand. The following example shows ellipsis

2.2 How to resolve ellipsis
2.2.1 Overview of the method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96696903030303">
We will show ellipsis resolution method of these
three patterns. For the first pattern, we replace the
pronoun with a word which referred by it. For
the second pattern, we try to fill up obligatory case
frames of the verb. For the third pattern, we take
a word from the previous question based on co-
occurrence frequency. We assumed that the an-
tecedent of an elliptical question exists in a question
which appears just before, so the “previous ques-
tion” indicates immediately previous question in our
method. We show the process as follows:
Step1 Estimate the pattern of ellipsis:
When a follow-up question has pronoun, this is
the case of the first pattern. When a follow-up
question has some verb which has an omitted
case element, this is the case of the second pat-
tern. When a follow-up question has no pro-
noun and such a verb, this is the case of the
third pattern.
Step2 Estimate kinds of the omitted word:
Step2a When the ellipsis pattern is the first pattern:
Estimate the kind of word which the pronoun
refers. When the pronoun directly indicates
kinds of word (ex: : he), depend on it. If
the pronoun does not directly indicate kinds of
word (ex: :its +noun), use the kind of the
word which exists just behind the pronoun.
Step2b When the ellipsis pattern is the second pat-
tern:
Estimate obligatory case frame of the verb of
the follow-up question. Then, estimate omitted
element of the case frame and the type of the
element.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.566047">
Step2c When the ellipsis pattern is the third pattern:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875631578947">
Get a noun X which appears with Japanese
particle “ (ha)”1 in the follow-up question.
When compound noun appears with “ (ha)”,
the last word is assumed to be X. Then, col-
lect words which are modifier or modificand
of X from corpus. If the same word as col-
lected words is in the previous question, take
over the word and skip step3. Otherwise, esti-
mate the kind of word which is suitable to mod-
ifier (or modificand) of X. Estimate the kind of
collected modifiers and modificands, and adopt
one which has the highest frequency.
Step3 Decide the succeeded word of the previous
question:
Estimate type of answer of previous question 2
and kind of each word used in previous ques-
tion from rear to front. When a word has a kind
fit for the estimate in step2, take the word to
follow-up question.

<bodyText confidence="0.975651">
We have used thesauruses of EDR dictionary to
estimate the kind of words, obligatory case frame of
verbs, omitted element of case frame, and to collect
modifier and modificand of a word. Details are as
follows:
Estimation of word type
We used EDR Japanese Word Dictionary and
EDR Concept Dictionary. Japanese Word Dictio-
nary records Japanese words and its detailed concept
as Concept Code, and Concept Dictionary records
each Concept Code and its upper concept. We check
a target word using Japanese Word Dictionary and

get its detailed concept code. Then, we generalize
type of the word using concept code of Concept Dic-
tionary.
For example, concept code of a word “ (com-
pany)” is 3ce735 which means “a group of people
combined together for business or trade”. We will
check its upper concept using Concept Dictionary,
for example, upper concept of 3ce735 is 4449f5, up-
per concept of 4449f5 is 30f74c, and so on. Finally,
we can get word type of 3ce735 as 3aa912 which
means “agent (self-functioning entity)”. Therefore,
we can estimate that type of word “ (company)”
is an agent.
Estimation of obligatory case frame of verb and
omitted element
We will use EDR Japanese Cooccurrence Dic-
tionary for estimation of omitted case element.
Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary contains infor-
mation of verb case frame and concept code with
Japanese particle for each case. We will check oblig-
atory case frame and omitted element. Firstly, we
check a verb with Japanese Cooccurrence Dictio-
nary and get its case frame, concept code and par-
ticle information. Then we can recognize omitted
case element by particle information and estimate
word type of omitted element.
For example, according to the Japanese Cooc-
currence Dictionary, a verb “ (inaugu-
rate)” has two case frames, agent (30f6b0) and goal
(3f98cb or 3aa938), and agent is used with particle “
(ga)”, goal is used with particle “ (ni)”. If ques-
tion doesn’t have any “ (ga)” or “ (ni)” (ex: “
(When did 0 inaugurate?)”), we
estimate that agent and goal are omitted. Then, we
estimate kind of the omitted element same as “Esti-
mation of kind of words”.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.982651">
Collection of modifier and modificand

<bodyText confidence="0.983473222222222">
Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary contains
Japanese co-occurrence data of various modifi-
cations. We will use the co-occurrence data to
collect modifier or modificand of word X. Details as
follows:
2. When Y appears in the “Y (no) X (X of Y)”
pattern, we can estimate Y as modifier of X.
3. When Y appears in the “X (no) Y (Y of X)”
pattern, we can estimate Y as modificand of X.

In the above example, Ex1-2 has a pronoun “
(it)”, so we classified ellipsis pattern of Ex1-2 into
the first pattern. Pronoun “ (it)” refers organi-
zation or location by information of pronoun. The
word “ (America)” has information of lo-
cation but the word “ (the president)” are not
organization or location. Then we can estimate that
pronoun “ (it)” of Ex1-2 refers the word “
(America)” of Ex1-1. Question Ex1-2 should
be “ (Who is the
president of America?)” .

have word which is suitable for obligatory cases of “

contain ellipsis. In our current implementation, we
assumed that antecedent of an elliptical question ex-
ists in its just before question. For example, the
antecedent of Q1-2 is “ (Mt.Fuji

fill up its obligatory cases because every oblig-
atory cases of this verb had already filled up.
It is necessary to handle these delexical verbs
such as “ ”, “ ”, “ ” and so on as
stop words.
Otherwise, there were several questions in
which all obligatory cases of verb has already
filled up. In this case, it is necessary to ap-
ply the other approach. In the example “
(What is the actor’s
name who attended opening event in the first
day?)”, some additional information for “open-
ing event” is omitted. Moreover, there were
some verbs which had no case information in
EDR dictionary. It would be helpful to check
co-occurrence with this word in the previous
question.

The expression “ (sokode)” in question
sentence was recognized as one conjunction “
(then)” although it should be analyzed
in “ (soko: there)” + “ (de: at)”. If mor-
phological analyzer works well, our algorithm
could handle ellipsis correctly.

3. Lack of rules for pronoun:
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.940400490566038">
In the expression “ (this
space station)” of question sentence, ellipsis
handling rule for pronoun “ (this)” was not
implemented, then our method could not han-
dle this case. It is necessary to expand our al-
gorithm for this case.
4. case information handling error:
q1
(Which
TV station is Ms. Sawako Agawa
working as TV caster?) (QAC3-31206-01)
q2
(What is the title of long novel which �
firstly wrote?) (QAC3-30029-05)
In the above example (q1 is the first question
and q2 is follow-up question), system checks
obligatory case elements of verb “ (write)”
of question q1. The verb “ ” has three
obligatory cases: agent, object and goal ac-
cording to EDR dictionary. System estimated
that every obligatory case element were omit-
ted, and checks “ (Ms. Sawako
Agawa)”, “ (TV caster)”, “
(TV caster)” respectively. However, ob-
ject case of verb “ ” was “ (long
novel)” of question q2 actually. In this ques-
tion, this element was modified by verb “
(write)”, then system failed to estimate that the
object was already filled. So, our algorithm
tried to fill this object case up as “
(TV caster)”. It is necessary to improve pat-
terns of estimation of omitted case element.
5. lack of co-occurrence information:
q3
(When is Reitaisai of
Nikko Toshogu held in every year?)
(QAC3-31235-01)
q4 (What is the
highlight?)(QAC3-30033-06)
q4’
(What is the highlight of Nikko Toshogu?)
In the above example, q3 is the first question
and q4 is the follow-up question. The ques-
tion q4 is replaced with q4’ using ellipsis han-
dling. In this case, system took wrong mod-
ifier “ (Nikko Toshogu)” for “
(highlight)”. It is caused by lack
of co-occurrence information in EDR Japanese
Cooccurrence Dictionary because these words
are proper nouns which are not frequently used.
In order to handle such cases, it is necessary to
use co-occurrence information using large cor-
pus.

In the above example, q5 is the first question
and q6 is the follow-up question. The question
q6 is replaced with q6’ using ellipsis handling
rules. System replaced “ (his)” of q6 with the
answer of q5. Because “ (his)” refers human
and the answer type of q5 is human, and the an-
swer of q5 was the nearest word which suitable
to “ (his)”. But, “ (his)” referred “
(Mr. Colin Powell)” actually. In this
case, “ (Mr. Colin Powell)”
was the topic of q5, so “ (Mr.
Colin Powell)” would be better one than the an-
swer of q5. Topic information handling would
be implemented in our algorithm.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994338">
In this paper, we have presented ellipsis handling
method for follow-up questions in IAD task. We
have classified ellipsis pattern of question sentences
into three types and proposed ellipsis handling al-
gorithm for each type. In the evaluation using For-
mal Run and Reference Run data, there were sev-
eral cases which our algorithm could not handle el-
lipsis correctly. According to the analysis of eval-
uation results, the main reason of low performance
was lack of word information for recognition of ref-
erential elements. If our system can recognize word
meanings correctly, some errors will not occur and
ellipsis handling works well.
We have already improved our ellipsis handling
method with recognition of target question. In the
evaluation of QAC3, our system searches elliptical
element in the previous question. However, we have
not tested this new algorithm using test correction.
In the future work, we will test this algorithm and
apply it for other QA application.
