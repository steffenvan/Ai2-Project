Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999209238095238">
Example-based machine translation (EBMT) is
based on a bilingual corpus. In EBMT, sen-
tences similar to an input sentence are retrieved
from a bilingual corpus and then output is gen-
erated from translations of similar sentences.
Therefore, a similarity measure between the in-
put sentence and each sentence in the bilingual
corpus is important for EBMT. If some similar
sentences are missed from retrieval, the qual-
ity of translations drops. In this paper, we de-
scribe a method to acquire synonymous expres-
sions from a bilingual corpus and utilize them
to expand retrieval of similar sentences. Syn-
onymous expressions are acquired from differ-
ences in synonymous sentences. Synonymous
sentences are clustered by the equivalence of
translations. Our method has the advantage of
not relying on rich linguistic knowledge, such as
sentence structure and dictionaries. We demon-
strate the effect on applying our method to a
simple EBMT.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999392178571429">
Example-based machine translation (EBMT) is
one of the main approaches to corpus-based ma-
chine translation, and it offers the advantage of
requiring far less manual work than rule-based
machine translation. The basic idea of EBMT
is that the translation of an input sentence can
be acquired by modifying translations of similar
sentences, as is done in the human translation
process (Nagao, 1981). Therefore, the selection
of similar sentences from a bilingual corpus is
important for EBMT. A similarity measure with
low retrieval ability lessens the exploitation of
the bilingual corpus and results in bad or no
translation.
Identifying synonymous expressions is an ef-
fective way to expand the retrieval of similar
sentences. It equates different expressions that
have almost the same meaning and shortens the
distance between sentences that are essentially
the same but look different.
In this paper, we describe a method to ex-
tract synonymous expressions from a bilingual
corpus. Extraction is based on differences be-
tween synonymous sentences by dynamic pro-
gramming match (DP-match)(Cormen et al.,
2001). The method has the advantage that it
does not require rich linguistic knowledge, such
as sentence structure and dictionaries.

2 Basic Idea
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999574">
The synonymous expressions (SE) defined in
this paper are focused on lexical variations. SE
are extracted by comparing synonymous sen-
tences (SS). In this section, we describe the ba-
sic idea of SS and SE.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.868759">
2.1 Synonymous Sentences (SS)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934157894737">
SS are defined as sentences that they have same
basic meaning and lexical differences. Satisfac-
tion of both conditions can be verified by a bilin-
gual corpus.
The condition having the same basic mean-
ing can be verified by the equivalence of trans-
lations. The left side of figure 1 shows an ex-
ample of a sentence group that has the com-
mon Japanese translation &amp;quot;syashin wo tottemo
iidesuka.&amp;quot; The sentences in this sentence group
satisfy the condition having same basic mean-
ing.
The condition having lexical variations is ver-
ified by an edit distance of DP-match between
two sentences, which represents the number
of word-level differences. Sentence pairs with
small edit distances share many common words
and are considered to have the same structure.
The right side of figure 1 shows the SS group,

which consists of SS pairs, derived from the sen-
tence group of the left side of figure 1. These
SS pairs have the same structure and lexical dif-
ferences. Sentence 5 has a large edit distance
compared with other sentences since it has a
different structure. Consequently, it is excluded
from the SS group shown in the right side of
figure 1.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998235">
2.2 Synonymous Expressions (SE)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999998857142857">
SE have three features: (1) they include sur-
rounding words of different expressions as con-
textual conditions, (2) they have influence on
the target language, and (3) they are not re-
stricted to any type of variation, such as con-
tent words or functional words. Details of each
feature are described in the following.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.852725">
2.2.1 Contextual Condition
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999880466666667">
Since in many cases the synonymy of expres-
sions depends on the context, SE must have
contextual conditions. The words &amp;quot;picture&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;photo&amp;quot; are synonymous if &amp;quot;picture&amp;quot; denotes
the meaning of &amp;quot;photo,&amp;quot; while they are not syn-
onymous if &amp;quot;picture&amp;quot; denotes the meaning of
&amp;quot;painting.&amp;quot; The auxiliary verbs &amp;quot;would&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;could&amp;quot; are interchangeable if they are used
in euphemistic request sentences like &amp;quot;(could
would) you pass me the salt?&amp;quot; but are not syn-
onymous in other sentences.
The common words surrounding different
words are used as a contextual condition. They
have the advantage that they are effective
enough as a contextual condition and are easy
to acquire. For example, the expressions &amp;quot;take
pictures&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;take photos&amp;quot; are synonymous in
most cases. The same applies to the expressions
&amp;quot;#i Would you&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;# Could you.&amp;quot;
An example of SE extracted from a corpus
of travel conversation (Takezawa et al., 2002)
(detail is described in 4.1) are shown in figure
2. The clusters tagged with E* represent En-
glish SE clusters based on Japanese translation,
and those tagged with J* represent Japanese
SE clusters based on English. The surround-
ing words of E1 properly work as a contextual
condition. Unfortunately, many SE have un-
necessary conditions or need other contextual
conditions.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.846568">
2.2.2 Influence on Target Language
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838611111111">
Extracted SE have influence on the target lan-
guage, since the synonymy of SE depends on
the equivalence of translations in the target lan-
guage. It is important that the influences are
quite valuable to similarity measure in translin-
gual application. Though some of them seem
inappropriate from the viewpoint of source lan-
guage alone, they have no bad influence on the
similarity measure.
In other words, differences in such SE show
that they are not distinguished from the view-
point of the target language. Figure 3 shows En-
glish SE with Japanese influences. C1 equates
the gender of a person, and C2 equates the dif-
ference of singular/plural. These differences are
seldom expressed in Japanese. C3 equates sim-
ilar but different objects. They share the same
translation &amp;quot;saifu&amp;quot; in Japanese.

SE do not have restrictions on the types of dif-
ferences. Therefore, there are many types of

3 Procedure for Extraction of SE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984773">
The procedure to extract clusters of SE, in
which all expressions are synonymous, is de-
scribed below. The following description
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.535794">
2This represents &amp;quot;end-of-sentence&amp;quot;
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.997211">
is based on extraction of English SE from
Japanese translations. Japanese SE from En-
glish translations can be extracted the same
way. A bilingual corpus is expressed as a set
of sentence pairs {(E1=J1), (E2=J2), ... ,
(En=Jn)}. Some of the sentences are equal (e.g.
E4 = E9, J1 = J5 = J11).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998377">
3.1 Clustering SS Group
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9600554">
English sentence groups that share the same
Japanese translation are clustered. If J1 = J5
= J9, then English sentence group {E1,E5,E9}
is clustered.
Each group is tested as described below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996138636363636">
1. All combinations of sentence pairs are ex-
tracted.
2. Apply DP-match to sentence pairs, regard-
ing sentences as word-sequences including
&amp;quot;head-of-sentence&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;end-of-sentence.&amp;quot;
Words are identified by their surface form
and part-of-speech (POS). Results of edit
operations extracted by the DP-match are
preserved for the following step.
3. Select both sentence pairs if their edit dis-
tance is within two.

3.2 Extraction of SE Pairs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999797789473684">
SE are based on edit operations extracted from
SS pairs. SE include not only differences but
also common words surrounding those differ-
ences. Figure 4 shows the extraction of SE
pairs from SS pairs. DP-match is applied
to the SS pair, and corresponding words are
bound. Two SE pairs &amp;quot;# Can F&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;# May P&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;take pictures %&amp;quot;= &amp;quot;take photos %&amp;quot; can
be extracted.
The frequency of each SE pair is also
counted for the following process. These fre-
quencies are based on SS groups, namely,
counting the number of SS groups in which
the target SE appears. For example, the
SE pair &amp;quot;# Can F&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;# May P&amp;quot; can be ex-
tracted from the SS group shown in figure 1.
Though this SE pair can be extracted from two
SS pairs (1)-(2) and (1)-(4), it adds only one
frequency to this SE pair counter.

SE pairs in which component expressions have
a small overlap are excluded, since it shows that
component expressions are synonymous only in
restricted cases. The filtering is done by com-
paring the frequency of SE pairs and that of
the more infrequent component expression. If
the frequency of the SE pair is lower than five
percent of the frequency of the more infrequent
component expression, the SE pair is excluded.

<bodyText confidence="0.999980277777778">
We used a bilingual corpus of travel conversa-
tion, which has Japanese sentences and their
English translations. This corpus was sentence-
aligned, and a morphological analysis was done
on both languages by our morphological analy-
sis tools.
The bilingual corpus was divided into training
data and evaluation data by extracting evalua-
tion data randomly from the whole set of data.
The training data were used to extract SE clus-
ters and the bilingual corpus of EBMT. The
evaluation data were used as a set of input sen-
tences. The statistics of the both data sets are
shown in table 1.
Sentences consisting of fewer than three
words were excluded from the experimental
data, since short sentences can represent vari-
ous meanings according to context.

The architecture of EBMT used in the ex-
periment is shown in figure 5. The similarity
measure module contains our method (dotted
box in figure 1). Similarity of the two sentences
is measured by an exact-match. It returns only
two values: exact-match or not. Translations
of exact-match sentences in the corpus are re-
trieved and output.
The system retrieves sentences that are the
same as the input sentence from a bilingual cor-
pus. Then, it outputs translations of retrieved
sentences. In the case of the &amp;quot;with&amp;quot; EBMT sys-
tem, SE between the input sentence and sen-
tences in the corpus were equated.
Translation was done in two directions: from
English to Japanese (E to J) and from Japanese
to English (J to E). English SE clusters were
used for E to J, and Japanese SE clusters were
used for J to E.

4.3 Expansion of Coverage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999714666666667">
The effect of coverage expansion is divided into
two types of input sentences: those acceptable
only to &amp;quot;with&amp;quot; EBMT and those acceptable to
both &amp;quot; w/o&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;with&amp;quot; EBMT. The former is
evaluated by the expansion of acceptable input
sentences. The latter is evaluated by the expan-
sion of retrieved translations. Expansion of re-
trieved translations is useful since many EBMT
systems (Sumita, 2001) (Veale and Way, 1997)
(Carl, 1999) (Brown, 2000) utilize plural trans-
lations from similar sentences to acquire output
translation.
The results of the two types are shown in ta-
ble 4. &amp;quot;Exp.&amp;quot; denotes the expansion ratio of
with to w/o. The results showan obvious effect
on the expansion of the coverage. Interestingly,
the expansion effect is similar in English and
Japanese.

4.4 Quality of Translations

The quality of translation was evaluated by na-
tive speakers of the target languages. They
evaluated translations as correct (Cor.) or not.
&amp;quot;Cor.&amp;quot; means that the translation is basically
appropriate for the translation of input sen-
tence. Small differences, such as degree of po-
liteness and exchange of pronouns, are not con-
sidered.
Translations of a part of the evaluation data,
1,048 source sentences in E to J and 1,094 in J
to E, were evaluated. When an input sentence
had plural translation candidates, they were in-
dividually evaluated and counted as correct or

5 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963916666667">
Many works have attempted to improve the sim-
ilarity measure on the lexical level. They require
other linguistic knowledge, while our method
does not.
A thesaurus has been utilized to measure the
semantic distance of words (Sumita, 2001). Se-
mantic distance is proportional to a hierarchi-
cal difference between two words. Morphologi-
cal knowledge and POS have also proven useful
(Nirenburg et al., 1994). Weights for the simi-
larity measure are changed by type of word, i.e.,
content word or functional word.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951181818182">
In this paper, we described a method to acquire
synonymous expressions from a bilingual cor-
pus. The method has the advantage of not re-
quiring rich linguistic knowledge for extraction.
The synonymous expressions defined in this pa-
per have three features: (1) they use the words
surrounding different words as contextual con-
ditions, (2) they contain the influence of the tar-
get language, and (3) they include various types
of expressions.
The experiment demonstrates that our
method expands the coverage of EBMT with-
out deterioration of translation quality. Fur-
thermore, our method has an equivalent effect
on both translation directions, E to J and J to
E.
Recently, we have been conducting experi-
ments to investigate the effects under various
source/target languages. Volume and validity
of extracted synonymous expressions depend on
source/target languages. Detailed analysis of
the relation would be an interesting future work.

<abstract confidence="0.998365363636364">Example-based machine translation (EBMT) is based on a bilingual corpus. In EBMT, sentences similar to an input sentence are retrieved from a bilingual corpus and then output is generated from translations of similar sentences. Therefore, a similarity measure between the input sentence and each sentence in the bilingual corpus is important for EBMT. If some similar are missed from retrieval, the ity of translations drops. In this paper, we dea method to synonymous expressions from a bilingual corpus and utilize them to expand retrieval of similar sentences. Synexpressions are from differences in synonymous sentences. Synonymous are clustered by the of translations. Our method has the advantage of not relying on rich linguistic knowledge, such as sentence structure and dictionaries. We demonstrate the effect on applying our method to a simple EBMT.</abstract>

A similarity measure with low retrieval ability lessens the exploitation of the bilingual corpus and results in bad or no translation. Identifying synonymous expressions is an effective way to expand the retrieval of similar sentences. It equates different expressions that have almost the same meaning and shortens the distance between sentences that are essentially the same but look different. In this paper, we describe a method to extract synonymous expressions from a bilingual corpus. Extraction is based on differences between synonymous sentences by dynamic programming match (DP-match)(Cormen et al., 2001). The method has the advantage that it does not require rich linguistic knowledge, such as sentence structure and dictionaries. 2 Basic Idea The synonymous expressions (SE) defined in this paper are focused on lexical variations. SE are extracted by comparing synonymous sentences (SS). In this section, we describe the basic idea of SS and SE. 2.1 Synonymous Sentences (SS) SS are defined as sentences that they have same basic meaning and lexical differences.

Our method has the advantage of not relying on rich linguistic knowledge, such as sentence structure and dictionaries. We demonstrate the effect on applying our method to a simple EBMT. 1 Introduction Example-based machine translation (EBMT) is one of the main approaches to corpus-based machine translation, and it offers the advantage of requiring far less manual work than rule-based machine translation. The basic idea of EBMT is that the translation of an input sentence can be acquired by modifying translations of similar sentences, as is done in the human translation process (Nagao, 1981). Therefore, the selection of similar sentences from a bilingual corpus is important for EBMT. A similarity measure with low retrieval ability lessens the exploitation of the bilingual corpus and results in bad or no translation. Identifying synonymous expressions is an effective way to expand the retrieval of similar sentences. It equates different expressions that have almost the same meaning and shortens the distance between sentences that are essentially the same but look different.

The common words surrounding different words are used as a contextual condition. They have the advantage that they are effective enough as a contextual condition and are easy to acquire. For example, the expressions &amp;quot;take pictures&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;take photos&amp;quot; are synonymous in most cases. The same applies to the expressions &amp;quot;#i Would you&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;# Could you.&amp;quot; An example of SE extracted from a corpus of travel conversation (Takezawa et al., 2002) (detail is described in 4.1) are shown in figure 2. The clusters tagged with E* represent English SE clusters based on Japanese translation, and those tagged with J* represent Japanese SE clusters based on English. The surrounding words of E1 properly work as a contextual condition. Unfortunately, many SE have unnecessary conditions or need other contextual conditions. 2.2.2 Influence on Target Language Extracted SE have influence on the target language, since the synonymy of SE depends on the equivalence of translations in the target language.
