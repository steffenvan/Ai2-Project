Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999725555555556">
Separable verbs are verbs with prefixes which, depending on the syntactic context, can occur as
one word written together or discontinuously. They occur in languages such as German and
Dutch and constitute a problem for NLP because they are lexemes whose forms cannot always be
recognized by dictionary lookup on the basis of a text word. Conventional solutions take a mixed
lexical and syntactic approach. In this paper, we propose the solution offered by Word Manager,
consisting of string-based recognition by means of rules of types also required for periphrastic
inflection and clitics. In this way, separable verbs are dealt with as part of the domain of reusable
lexical resources. We show how this solution compares favourably with conventional
approaches.

1. The Problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998628333333333">
In German there exists a large class of verbs
which behave like aufhoren (&apos;stop&apos;),
illustrated in (1).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.837168833333333">
(1) a. Anna glaubt, dass Bernard aufhort.
(`Anna believes that Bernard stops&apos;)
b. Claudia hart jetzt auf.
(&apos;Claudia stops now PRT&apos;)
c. Daniel versucht aufzuhoren.
(&apos;Daniel tries to_stop&apos;)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999588263157895">
In subordinate clauses as in (la), the particle
auf and the inflected part of the verb hart are
written together. In main clauses such as
(lb), the inflected form 1011 is moved by
verb-second, leaving the particle stranded. In
infinitive clauses with the particle zu (&apos;to&apos;),
zu separates the two components of the verb
and all three elements are written together.
In analysis, the problem of separable verbs
is to combine the two parts of the verb in
contexts such as (lb) and (lc). Such a
combination is necessary because syntactic
and semantic properties of aufhoren are the
same, irrespective of whether the two parts
are written together or not, but they cannot
be deduced from the syntactic and semantic
properties of the parts. Therefore, a solution
to the problem of separable verbs will treat
(lb) as if it read (2a) and (lc) as (2b):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9982735">
(2) a. Claudia aufhort jetzt.
b. Daniel versucht zu aufhoren.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9913058">
The problem arises in a very similar fashion
in Dutch, as the Dutch translations (3) of the
sentences in (1) show. The only difference is
that the infinitive in (3c) is not written
together.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999363333333333">
(3) a. Anna gelooft dat Bernard ophoudt.
b. Claudia houdt nu op.
c. Daniel probeert op te houden.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997544">
On the other hand, the problem of separable
verbs in German and Dutch differs from the
corresponding one in English, because
English verbs such as look up are multi-
word units in all contexts. A treatment of
these cases which is in line with the solution
proposed here is described by Tschichold
(forthcoming).
As suggested by the English translation,
separable verbs in German and Dutch are
lexemes. Therefore, an important issue in
evaluating a mechanism for dealing with
them is how it fits in with the reusability of
lexical resources.
Given the importance of the orthographic
component in the problem, it is not
surprising that it is hardly if ever treated in
the linguistic literature.

2. Previous Approaches
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985898072727273">
In existing systems or resources for NLP,
separable verbs are usually treated as a
lexicographic and syntactic problem. Two
typical approaches can be illustrated on the
basis of Celex and Rosetta.
Celex (http://www.kun.nl/celex) is a lexical
database project offering a German
dictionary with 50000 entries and a Dutch
dictionary with 120&apos;000 entries. In these
dictionaries separable verbs are listed with a
feature conveying the information that they
belong to the class of separable verbs and a
bracketing structure showing the
decomposition into a prefix and a base, e.g.
(auf)(horen). Celex dictionaries are reusable,
but the rule component for the interpretation
of the information on separable verbs, i.e.
the mechanism for going from (lb-c) to (2),
remains to be developed by each NLP-
system using the dictionaries.
Rosetta is a machine translation system
which includes Dutch as one of the source
and target languages. Rosetta (1994:78-79)
describes how separable verbs are treated.
For the verb ophouden illustrated in (3),
there are three lexical entries, ophouden for
the continuous forms as in (3a), and houden
and op for the discontinuous forms as in
(3b-c). When a form of houden is found in a
text, it is multiply ambiguous, because it can
be a form of the simple verb houden (&apos;hold&apos;)
or of one of the separable verbs ophouden
(&apos;stop&apos;), aanhouden (&apos;arrest&apos;), afhouden
(&apos;withhold&apos;), etc. The entry for houden as
part of ophouden contains the information
â€¢that it must be combined with a particle op.
At the same time, op is ambiguous between a
reading as preposition or particle. In syntax,
there is a rule combining the two elements in
a sentence such as (3b). It is clear that, while
this approach may work, it is far from
elegant. It creates ambiguity and
redundancies, because ophouden written
together is treated in a different entry from
op + houden as a discontinuous unit. These
properties make the resulting dictionaries
less transparent and do not favour
reusability.
It should be pointed out that Celex and
Rosetta were not chosen because their
solution to the problem of separable verbs is
worse than others. They are representative
examples of currently used strategies,
chosen mainly because they are relatively
well-documented.

3. The Word Manager
Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.924772129032258">
Word ManagerTM (WM) is a system for
morphological dictionaries. It includes rules
for inflection and derivation (WM proper)
and for clitics and multi-word units (Phrase
Manager, PM). We will use WM here as a
name for the combination of the two
components. A general description of the
design of WM, with references to various
publications where the formalism is
discussed in more detail, can be found in ten
Hacken &amp; Domenig (1996).
The German WM dictionary consists of a
comprehensive set of inflectional and word
formation rules describing the full range of
morphological processes in German. In the
last two years we have specified more than
100000 database entries by classification of
lexemes in terms of inflection rules (for
morphologically simple entries) and by the
application of word formation rules (for
morphologically complex entries). In
addition, the PM module contains a set of
rules for clitics and multi-word units which
covers German periphrastic inflection
patterns and separable verbs.
The rule types invoked in the treatment of
separable verbs in WM include Inflection
Rules (IRules), Word Formation Rules
(WF Rules), Per Inflection
(PIRules), and Clitic Rules (CRules). We
will describe each of them in turn.

specification of the individual string. The
class is defined by the linguist in the
specification of inflection processes. The
specification of the string is part of the
lexicographic specification, i.e. the string
specification is the result of the application of
the word formation rule the lexicographer
chooses for the definition of an individual
entry. In the IRules, detachable prefixes are
referred to as formatives in the formulae
generating the word forms. Fig. 1 gives the
relevant rule of the database for otherwise
regular separable verbs, such as aufhoren.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986352">
3.2. Word Formation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945319638888889">
Word Formation Rules consist of a source
definition and a target definition. The source
definition determines what (kind of)
formatives are taken to form a new word.
The target definition specifies how the
source formatives are combined, and which
inflection rule the new word is assigned to.
Separable verbs are the result of WFRules
which are remarkable because of their target.
The target specification is as in Fig. 2. This
specification departs from the usual
specification of a target in a WFRule in two
respects. First, instead of concatenating the
source formatives, the rule lists them,
leaving concatenation to the IRule. This is
necessary to form the past participle
aufgehort, where the two formatives are
separated by the prefix ge- (cf. last line of
Fig. 1). Separable verbs are specified by the
lexicographer by linking a word to a
WFRule having a target specification as in
Fig. 2. In the case of aufhoren, this is a rule
for prefixing in which &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; in Fig. 2 matches
a closed set of predefined prefixes. The
IRules and WFRules described so far cover
the non-separated occurrences as in (la).
The second special property of the
specification in Fig. 2 is the system keyword
&amp;quot;separable&amp;quot; in the second line. It assigns
the result of the WFRule to the predefined
class %separable. This class, whose
name is defined in the WM-formalism, can
be used to establish a link between the result
of word formation and the input to the
periphrastic inflection mechanism used to
recognize occurrences such as in (lb).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970242">
3.3. Periphrastic Inflection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999745">
The mechanism for periphrastic inflection in
WM consists of two parts. PIClasses are
used to identify the components and PIRules
to turn them into a single word form. The
PIRule for separable verbs in German is
given in Fig. 3. The rule in Fig. 3 consists
of a name and a body, which in turn consists
of input and output specifications separated
by &amp;quot;=&amp;quot;. The input specifies a finite verb form
(infinitive and participles are excluded by
&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;) and a detachable prefix. The output
combines them in the position of the verb,
with the form prefix + verb, and with the
features percolated from the verb (person,

number, etc.). This yields (2a) as a step in
the analysis of (lb).
The possibilities for specifying the relative
position of the two elements to be combined
are the same as the possibilities for multi-
word units in general. In the PIClass for
German it is specified that the finite verb
always precedes the particle when the two
are separated. In Dutch this is not the case,
as illustrated by (3c), so that a different
specification is required.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994158">
3.4. Clitic Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998684133333333">
The clitic rule mechanism is used to analyse
aufzuhoren in (1c) and produce zu aufhoren
as in (2b). The CRule used is given in Fig.
4. Again input and output are separated by
&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;. The input consists of the concatenation
of three elements: a detachable prefix,
infinitival zu, and an infinitive. Graphic
concatenation is indicated by &amp;quot;+&amp;quot;. The
CElement zu is defined elsewhere as a form
of the infinitival zu, rather than the
homonymous preposition, in order not to
lose information. The output consists of two
words, as indicated by the comma, the
second of which concatenates the prefix and
the verb.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9826265">
3.5. Recognition and
Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9808635">
In recognition, the input is the largest
domain over which components of multi-
word units (MWUs) can be spread. In
practice, this coincides with the sentence.
Since WM does not contain a parser, larger
chunks of input will result in spurious
recognition of potential MWUs. Let us
assume as an example that the sentences in
(1) are given as input.
The first component to act is the clitics
component. It leaves everything unchanged
except (1c), which is replaced by (2b):
aufzuhOren =&gt; zu aufhoren. Then the rules
of WM proper are activated. They replace
each word form by a set of analyses in terms
of a string and feature set. In (la), aulhort is
analysed as third person singular or second
person plural of the present tense of
aufhoren, in (lb) hod and auf are analysed
separately, and in (lc) aufhoren, which was
given the feature infinitive by the CRule in
Fig. 4, only as infinitive, not as any of the
homonymous forms in the paradigm. The
next step is periphrastic inflection. It applies
to (la) and (lc) vacuously, but combines
hart and aut. in ( lb), producing the feature
description corresponding to (2b): hort auf
=&gt; aufhort. Finally, the idiom recognition
component (not treated here) applies
vacuously.
A general remark on recognition is in order
here. The rule components of PM, i.e.
clitics, periphrastic inflection and idiom
recognition add their results to the set of
intermediate representations available at the
relevant point. Thus, after the clitic
component, aufzuhoren continues to exist
alongside zu aufhoren in the analysis of (lc).
Since the former cannot be analysed by WM
proper, it is discarded. Likewise, hort will
survive in (lb) after periphrastic inflection
and indeed as part of the final result. This is
necessary in examples such as (4):
(4) Der Hund hort auf den Namen Wurzel.
(`The dog answers to the name [of]
Wurzel&apos;)
Since rules in WM are not inherently
directional, it is also possible to generate all
forms of a lexeme such as aufhoren in the
way they may occur in a text. The client

4. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997820607142857">
Separable verbs in German and Dutch
constitute a problem in NLP because they are
lexemes whose recognition is not simply a
matter of dictionary lookup. Therefore, a
reusable lexical database such as Celex does
not offer a comprehensive solution to the
problem. On the other hand, treating them as
a problem of syntactic recognition, as
implemented in, for instance, Rosetta, fails
to account for the lexeme character of
separable verbs. As a consequence, spurious
ambiguities and redundancies are created.
Ambiguities arise between a simple verb
such as horen (&apos;hear&apos;) and the same form
functioning as part of a separable verb such
as aufhoren. Redundancies emerge between
the two different entries for aufhoren, one
for the continuous and one for the
discontinuous occurrences.
In Word Manager, the recognition of
separable verbs is entirely within the
reusable lexical domain. A client application
can start from an input which resembles (2)
rather than ( lb-c). An indication of the type
of input is given in (5) and (6). For (ib),
(5a) and (5b) are offered as alternatives. For
(lc), (6) is offered as the only analysis
(modulo syncretism of versucht).

<bodyText confidence="0.999885">
The task of the client application in the
recognition of separable verbs in (1) is
reduced to the choice of (5a) rather than
(5b).
Finally, two points deserve to be
emphasized. First, the entire WM-formalism
for separable verbs has been implemented as
described here. The rules for German have
been formulated and a large dictionary for
German (100&apos;000 entries) including
separable verbs is available. Moreover, the
only provision in the WM-formalism
specifically geared towards the treatment of
separable verbs is the keyword separable in
WFRules (cf. Fig. 2) and the corresponding
class name %separable. Otherwise the entire
formalism used for separable verbs is
available as a consequence of general
requirements of morphology and multi-word
units.

Such a combination is necessary because syntactic semantic properties of the same, irrespective of whether the two parts are written together or not, but they cannot be deduced from the syntactic and semantic properties of the parts. Therefore, a solution to the problem of separable verbs will treat (lb) as if it read (2a) and (lc) as (2b): (2) a. Claudia aufhort jetzt. b. Daniel versucht zu aufhoren. The problem arises in a very similar fashion in Dutch, as the Dutch translations (3) of the sentences in (1) show. The only difference is that the infinitive in (3c) is not written together. (3) a.

In syntax, there is a rule combining the two elements in a sentence such as (3b). It is clear that, while this approach may work, it is far from elegant. It creates ambiguity and because together is treated in a different entry from + houden a discontinuous unit. These properties make the resulting dictionaries less transparent and do not favour reusability. It should be pointed out that Celex and Rosetta were not chosen because their solution to the problem of separable verbs is worse than others. They are representative examples of currently used strategies, chosen mainly because they are relatively well-documented. 3. The Word Manager Approach Word ManagerTM (WM) is a system for morphological dictionaries. It includes rules for inflection and derivation (WM proper) and for clitics and multi-word units (Phrase Manager, PM). We will use WM here as a name for the combination of the two components. A general description of the design of WM, with references to various publications where the formalism is discussed in more detail, can be found in ten Hacken &amp; Domenig (1996). The German WM dictionary consists of a comprehensive set of inflectional and word formation rules describing the full range of morphological processes in German.

In addition, the PM module contains a set of rules for clitics and multi-word units which covers German periphrastic inflection patterns and separable verbs. The rule types invoked in the treatment of separable verbs in WM include Inflection Rules (IRules), Word Formation Rules (WF Rules), Per Inflection (PIRules), and Clitic Rules (CRules). We will describe each of them in turn. 3.1. Inflection inflection, treated as a verb a detachable prefix detachable prefix is defined as an underspecified IFormative.

The class is defined by the linguist in the specification of inflection processes. The specification of the string is part of the lexicographic specification, i.e. the string specification is the result of the application of the word formation rule the lexicographer chooses for the definition of an individual entry. In the IRules, detachable prefixes are referred to as formatives in the formulae generating the word forms. Fig. 1 gives the relevant rule of the database for otherwise separable verbs, such as 3.2. Word Formation Word Formation Rules consist of a source definition and a target definition. The source definition determines what (kind of) are taken to form word. The target definition specifies how the source formatives are combined, and which inflection rule the new word is assigned to. Separable verbs are the result of WFRules which are remarkable because of their target. The target specification is as in Fig. 2. This specification departs from the usual specification of a target in a WFRule in two respects. First, instead of concatenating the source formatives, the rule lists them, leaving concatenation to the IRule. This is necessary to form the past participle the two formatives are by the prefix last line of Fig. 1). Separable verbs are specified by the lexicographer by linking a word to a WFRule having a target specification as in 2. In the case of is a rule for prefixing in which &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; in Fig. 2 matches a closed set of predefined prefixes. The IRules and WFRules described so far cover the non-separated occurrences as in (la). The second special property of the specification in Fig. 2 is the system keyword &amp;quot;separable&amp;quot; in the second line. It assigns the result of the WFRule to the predefined class, whose name is defined in the WM-formalism, can be used to establish a link between the result of word formation and the input to the periphrastic inflection mechanism used to recognize occurrences such as in (lb). 3.3. Periphrastic Inflection The mechanism for periphrastic inflection in WM consists of two parts. PIClasses are used to identify the components and PIRules to turn them into a single word form. The PIRule for separable verbs in German is given in Fig. 3. The rule in Fig. 3 consists of a name and a body, which in turn consists of input and output specifications separated by &amp;quot;=&amp;quot;. The input specifies a finite verb form (infinitive and participles are excluded by &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;) and a detachable prefix. The output combines them in the position of the verb, with the form prefix + verb, and with the features percolated from the verb (person, 473 Separable (Cat V) A (Mod Inf )^ (Mod Part) + %separable = (POS 1) (FORM 2+1) (PERC 1) (Cat V) Fig. 3: Periphrastic Inflection Rule for separable verbs in WM. %separable + (CElement zu) + (Cat V) (Mod Inf ) (Temp Pres) = (CElement zu) , %separable + (Cat V) (Mod Inf) (Temp Pres) Fig. 4: CRule for the infinitive of separable verbs in WM. number, etc.). This yields (2a) as a step in the analysis of (lb). The possibilities for specifying the relative position of the two elements to be combined are the same as the possibilities for multiword units in general. In the PIClass for German it is specified that the finite verb always precedes the particle when the two are separated. In Dutch this is not the case, as illustrated by (3c), so that a different specification is required. 3.4. Clitic Rules The clitic rule mechanism is used to analyse (1c) and produce aufhoren as in (2b). The CRule used is given in Fig. 4. Again input and output are separated by &amp;quot;=&amp;quot;. The input consists of the concatenation of three elements: a detachable prefix, an infinitive. Graphic concatenation is indicated by &amp;quot;+&amp;quot;. The defined elsewhere as a form the infinitival than the homonymous preposition, in order not to lose information. The output consists of two words, as indicated by the comma, the second of which concatenates the prefix and the verb. 3.5. Recognition and Generation In recognition, the input is the largest domain over which components of multiword units (MWUs) can be spread. In practice, this coincides with the sentence. Since WM does not contain a parser, larger chunks of input will result in spurious recognition of potential MWUs. Let us assume as an example that the sentences in (1) are given as input. The first component to act is the clitics component. It leaves everything unchanged except (1c), which is replaced by (2b): =&gt; zu aufhoren. the rules of WM proper are activated. They replace each word form by a set of analyses in terms a string and feature set. In (la), analysed as third person singular or second person plural of the present tense of (lb) analysed and in (lc) was given the feature infinitive by the CRule in Fig. 4, only as infinitive, not as any of the homonymous forms in the paradigm. The next step is periphrastic inflection. It applies to (la) and (lc) vacuously, but combines in ( lb), producing the feature corresponding to (2b): auf aufhort. the idiom recognition component (not treated here) applies vacuously. A general remark on recognition is in order here. The rule components of PM, i.e. clitics, periphrastic inflection and idiom recognition add their results to the set of intermediate representations available at the relevant point. Thus, after the clitic to exist aufhoren the analysis of (lc). Since the former cannot be analysed by WM it is discarded. Likewise, survive in (lb) after periphrastic inflection and indeed as part of the final result. This is necessary in examples such as (4): (4) Der Hund hort auf den Namen Wurzel. (`The dog answers to the name [of] Wurzel&apos;) Since rules in WM are not inherently directional, it is also possible to generate all of a lexeme such as the way they may occur in a text. The client 474 application required for this task can also include codes indicating places in the string where other material may intervene, because this information is available in the relevant PIClass of the database. (6) daniel (Cat Noun) versuchen (Cat Verb)(Tense Pres) (Pers Third)(Num SG) (Cat Inf-marker) zu (Cat Verb)(Mode Int) aufhoren 4. Conclusion Separable verbs in German and Dutch constitute a problem in NLP because they are lexemes whose recognition is not simply a matter of dictionary lookup. Therefore, a reusable lexical database such as Celex does not offer a comprehensive solution to the problem. On the other hand, treating them as a problem of syntactic recognition, as implemented in, for instance, Rosetta, fails to account for the lexeme character of separable verbs. As a consequence, spurious ambiguities and redundancies are created. Ambiguities arise between a simple verb as and the same form functioning as part of a separable verb such emerge between two different entries for for the continuous and one for the discontinuous occurrences. In Word Manager, the recognition of separable verbs is entirely within the reusable lexical domain. A client application can start from an input which resembles (2) rather than ( lb-c). An indication of the type of input is given in (5) and (6). For (ib), (5a) and (5b) are offered as alternatives. For (lc), (6) is offered as the only analysis syncretism of (5) a. claudia (Cat Noun) aufhoren (Cat Verb)(Tense Pres) (Pers Third)(Num SG) jetzt (Cat Adv) b. claudia (Cat Noun) horen (Cat Verb)(Tense Pres) (Pers Third)(Num SG) jetzt (Cat Adv) auf (Cat Prep) The task of the client application in the recognition of separable verbs in (1) is reduced to the choice of (5a) rather than (5b). Finally, two points deserve to be emphasized. First, the entire WM-formalism for separable verbs has been implemented as described here. The rules for German have been formulated and a large dictionary for German (100&apos;000 entries) including separable verbs is available. Moreover, the only provision in the WM-formalism specifically geared towards the treatment of verbs is the keyword WFRules (cf. Fig. 2) and the corresponding name the entire formalism used for separable verbs is available as a consequence of general requirements of morphology and multi-word units.</abstract>

In these dictionaries separable verbs are listed with a feature conveying the information that they belong to the class of separable verbs and a bracketing structure showing the decomposition into a prefix and a base, e.g. (auf)(horen). Celex dictionaries are reusable, but the rule component for the interpretation of the information on separable verbs, i.e. the mechanism for going from (lb-c) to (2), remains to be developed by each NLPsystem using the dictionaries. Rosetta is a machine translation system which includes Dutch as one of the source and target languages. Rosetta (1994:78-79) describes how separable verbs are treated. For the verb ophouden illustrated in (3), there are three lexical entries, ophouden for the continuous forms as in (3a), and houden and op for the discontinuous forms as in (3b-c). When a form of houden is found in a text, it is multiply ambiguous, because it can be a form of the simple verb houden (&apos;hold&apos;) or of one of the separable verbs ophouden (&apos;stop&apos;), aanhouden (&apos;arrest&apos;), afhouden (&apos;withhold&apos;), etc. The entry for houden as part of ophouden contains the information â€¢that it must be combined with a particle op.
