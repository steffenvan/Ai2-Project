<bodyText confidence="0.999779823529412">
Machine translation between any two languages re-
quires the generation of information that is implicit
in the source language. In translating from Chinese
to English, tense and other temporal information
must be inferred from other grammatical and lex-
ical cues. Moreover, Chinese multiple-clause sen-
tences may contain inter-clausal relations (temporal
or otherwise) that must be explicit in English (e.g.,
by means of a discourse marker). Perfective and im-
perfective grammatical aspect markers can provide
cues to temporal structure, but such information is
not present in every sentence. We report on a project
to use the lexical aspect features of (a)telicity re-
flected in the Lexical Conceptual Structure of the
input text to suggest tense and discourse structure
in the English translation of a Chinese newspaper
corpus.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999300820512821">
It is commonly held that an appropriate interlingua
must allow for the expression of argument relations
in many languages. This paper advances the state of
the art of designing an interlingua by showing how
aspectual distinctions (telic versus atelic) can be de-
rived from verb classifications primarily influenced
by considerations of argument structure, and how
these aspectual distinctions can be used to fill lexical
gaps in the source language that cannot be left un-
specified in the target language. Machine translation
between any two languages often requires the gen-
eration of information that is implicit in the source
language. In translating from Chinese to English,
tense and other temporal information must be in-
ferred from other grammatical and lexical cues. For
example, Chinese verbs do not necessarily specify
whether the event described is prior or cotempora-
neous with the moment of speaking. While gram-
matical aspect information can be loosely associated
with time, with imperfective aspect (Chinese l zai-
and t -zhe) representing present time and perfec-
tive (Chinese 7 le) representing past time, (Chu,
We gratefully acknowledge DOD support for this work
through contract MDA904-96-R-0738
1998; Li and Thompson, 1981), verbs in the past
do not need to have any aspect marking distinguish-
ing them from present tense verbs. This is unlike
English, which much more rigidly distinguishes past
from present tense through use of suffixes. Thus, in
order to generate an appropriate English sentence
from its Chinese counterpart, we need to fill in a
potentially unexpressed tense.
Moreover, Chinese multiple-clause sentences may
contain implicit relations between clauses (temporal
or otherwise) that must be made explicit in English.
These multiple-clause sentences are often most nat-
urally translated into English including an overt ex-
pression of their relation, e.g., the &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; linking the
two clauses in (1), or as multiple sentences, as in (2)).

In our NLP applications, we use a level of linguis-
tic structure driven by the argument-taking proper-
ties of predicates and composed monotonically up to
the sentence level. The resulting Lexical Conceptual
Structures (LCS) (Jackendoff, 1983), is a language-
neutral representation of the situation (event or
state), suitable for use as an interlingua, e.g., for
machine translation. The LCS represents predicate
argument structure abstracted away from language-
specific properties of semantics and syntax. The

primitives of the interlingua provide for monotonic
composition that captures both conceptual and syn-
tactic generalities (Don et al., 1993) among lan-
guages.&apos; The strength of the representation derives
from the cross-linguistic regularities in the lexical se-
mantics encoded in the LCS. The syntactic hierarchy
(subject, object, oblique) is mirrored in the LCS hi-
erarchy: for example THEMES are arguments of the
LCS predicate, and AGENTS are arguments of the
theme-predicate composition. Syntactic divergences
(whether the object precedes or follows the verb, for
example) are represented in language specific lin-
earization rules; lexical divergences (whether the lo-
cation argument is encoded directly in the verb, e.g.
the English verb pocket or must be saturated by an
external argument) are stated in terms of the pieces
of LCS structure in the lexicon. Sentential repre-
sentations derive from saturating the arguments re-
quired by the predicates in the sentence.
LCS representations also include temporal infor-
mation, where available in the source language: re-
cent revisions include, for example (Dorr and Olsen,
1997a) standardizing LCS representations for the as-
pectual (un)boundedness ((a)TEmcITY) of events,
either lexically or sententially represented. Although
at present the LCS encodes no supra-sentential dis-
course relations, we show how the lexical aspect in-
formation may be used to generate discourse co-
herence in temporal structure. Relations between
clauses as constrained by temporal reference has
been examined in an LCS framework by Dorr and
Caasterland (Dorr and Gaasterland, 1995). They
explore how temporal connectives are constrained
in interpretation, based on the tense of the clauses
they connect. While overt temporal connectives are
helpful when they appear, our corpus contains many
sentences with neither tense markers nor tense con-
nectives. We must therefore look to a new source of
information. We rely on the lexical information of
the verbs within a sentence to generate both tense
and temporal connectives.
Straightforward LCS analysis of many of the
multi-clause sentences in our corpus leads to vio-
lations of the wellformedness conditions, which pre-
vent structures with events or states directly modi-
fying other events or states. LCS, as previously con-
ceived, prohibits an event or state from standing in a
modifier relationship to another event or state, with-
out mediation of a path or position (i.e., as lexically
realized by a preposition). This restriction reflects
the insight that (at least in English) when events and
states modify each other, the modification is either
implicit, with the relevant events and states in sepa-
rate sentences (and hence separate LCSs), as in the
&apos;LCS representations in our system have been created for
Korean, Spanish and Arabic, as well as for Enghsh and Chi-
nese.

<bodyText confidence="0.999980625">
It is exactly these third type that are permitted
in standard Chinese and robustly attested in our
data. If the LCS is to be truly an interlingua, we
must extend the representation to allow these kinds
of sentences to be processed. One possibility is to
posit an implicit position connecting the situations
described by the multiple clauses. In the source lan-
guage analysis phase, this would amount to positing
a disjunction of all possible position relations im-
plicitly realizable in this language. Another option
is to relax the weliformedness constraints to allow
an event to directly modify another event. This not
only fails to recognize the regularities we see in En-
glish (and other language) LCS structures, for Chi-
nese it merely pushes the problem back one step,
as the set of implicitly realizable relations may vary
from language to language and may result in some
ungrammatical or misleading translations. The sec-
ond option can be augmented, however, by factoring
out of the interlingua (and into the generation code)
language-specific principles for generating connec-
tives using information in the LCS-structure, proper.
For the present, this is the approach we take, us-
ing lexical aspectual information, as read from the
LCS structure, to generate appropriate temporal re-
lations.
Therefore not only tense, but inter-sentential dis-
course relations must be considered when generating
English from Chinese, even at the sentence level, We
report on a project to generate both temporal and
discourse relations using the LCS representation. In
particular, we focus on the encoding of the lexical as-
pect feature TELIGITY and its complement ATELIC-
[TY to generate past and present tense, and corre-
sponding temporal relations for modifying clauses
within sentences. While we cannot at present di-
rectly capture discourse rela.tions, we can garner as-
pectual class from LCS verb classification, which in
turn can be used to predict the appropriate tense for
translations of Chinese verbs into English.

presented in a sentence. Such information can be
used to help provide clues as to both tense and rela-
tionships (and cue words) between connected situa-
tions. Aspectual features can be divided into gram-
matical aspect, which is indicated by lexical or mor-
phological markers in a sentence, and lexical aspect,
which is inherent in the meanings of words.

2.1 Grammatical aspect
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999895476190476">
Grammatical aspect provides a viewpoint on situa-
tion (event or state) structure (Smith, 1997). Since
imperfective aspect, such as the English PROGRES-
SIVE construction be VERB-ing, views a situation
from within, it is often associated with present
or contemporaneous time reference. On the other
hand, perfective aspect, such as the English have
VERB-ed, iiiews a situation as a whole; it is there-
fore often associated With past time reference ((Cam-
re, 1976; Olsen, 1997; Smith, 1997) cf. (Chu,
1998)). The temporal relations are tendencies,
rather than an absolute correlation: although the
perfective is found more frequently in past tenses
(Comrie, 1976), both imperfective and perfective co-
occur in some language with past, present, and fu-
ture tense.
In some cases, an English verb will specify tense
and/or aspect for a complement. For example, con-
tinue requires either an infinitive (3)a or progressive
complement (3)b (and subject drop), while other
verbs like say do not place such restrictions (3)c,d.

2.2 Lexical aspect
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860541666667">
While grammatical aspect and overt temporal cues
are clearly helpful in translation, there are many
cases in our corpus in which such cues are not
present. These are the hard cases, where we must
infer tense or grammatical aspectual marking in the
target language from a source that looks like it pro-
vides no overt cues. We will show however, that
Chinese does provide implicit cues through its lex-
ical aspect classes. First, we review what lexical
aspect is.
Lexical aspect refers to the type of situation de-
noted by the verb, alone or combined with other
sentential constituents. Verbs are assigned to lexical
aspect classes based on their behavior in a variety of
syntactic and semantic frames that focus on three as-
pectual features: telicity, dynamicity and clurativity.
We focus on telicity, also known as ROUNDEDNESS.
Verbs that are telic have an inherent end: winning,
for example, ends with the finish line. Verbs that are
atelic do not name their end: running could end with
a distance run a mile or an endpoint run to The store,
for example. Olsen (Olsen, 1997) proposed that as-
pectual interpretation be derived through monotonic
composition of marked privative features [+/0 dy-
namic], [+/(1 durative] and [+10 telic], as shown in
Table 1 (Olsen, 1997, pp. 32-33).
With privative features, other sentential con-
stituents can add to features provided by the verb
but not remove them. On this analysis, the H-du-
rative, +dynamic] features of run propagate to the
sentence level in run. to the store; the [+telic] feature
is added by the NP or PP, yielding an accomplish-
ment interpretation. The feature specification of this
compositionally derived accomplishment is therefore
identical to that of a sentence containing a telic ac-
complishment verb, such as destroy.
According to many researchers, knowledge of lex-
ical aspect—how verbs denote situations as devel-
oping or holding in time—may be used to interpret
event sequences in discourse (Dowty, 1986; Moens
and Steedman, 1988; Passoneau, 1988). In particu-
lar, Dowty suggests that, absent other cues, a telic
event is interpreted as completed before the next
event or state, as with ran into the room in 4a; in
contrast, atelic situations, such as run, was hungry
in 4b and 4c, are interpreted as contemporaneous
with the following situations: fell and made a pizza,
respectively.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971848692307692">
Smith similarly suggests that in English all past
events are interpreted as telic (Smith, 1997) (but cf.
(Olsen, 1997)).
Also, these tendencies are heuristic, and not abso-
lute, as shown by the examples in (5). While we get
the expected prediction that the jumping occurs af-
ter the explosion in (5)(a), we get the reverse predic-
tion in (5)(b). Other factors such as consequences of
described situations, discourse context, and stereo-
typical causal relationships also play a role.

3 Aspect in Lexical Conceptual
Structure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998436030303031">
Our implementation of Lexical Conceptual Struc-
ture (Dowty, 3,979; Guerssel et at., 1985)—an
augmented form of (Jackendoff, 1983; Jackendoff,
1990)—permits lexical aspect information to be
read &apos;directly off the lexical entries for individual
verbs, as well-as composed representations for sen-
tences, using uniform processes and representations.
The LCS framework consists of primitives (GO,
BE, STAY, etc.), types (Event, State, Path, etc.)
and fields (Loc(ational), Temp(oral), Poss(essional),
Ident(ificational), Perc(eptual), etc.).
We adopt a refinement of the LCS representation,
incorporating meaning components from the linguis-
tically motivated notion of lexical semantic template
(LST), based on lexical aspect classes, as defined
in the work of Levin and Rappaport Hovav (Levin
and Rappaport Hovav, 1995; Rappaport Hovav and
Levin, 1995). Verbs that appear in multiple as-
pectual frames appear in multiple pairings between
constants (representing the idiosyncratic meaning
of the verb) and structures (the aspectual class).
Since the aspectual templates may be realized in
a variety of ways, other aspects of the structural
meaning contribute to differentiating the verbs from
each other. Our current database contains some 400
classes, based on an initial representation of the 213
classes in (Levin, 1993). Our current working lexi-
con includes about 10,000 English verbs and 18,000
Chinese verbs spread out into these classes.
Telic verbs (and sentences) contain certain types
of Paths, or a constant, represented by ! , filled by
the verb constant, in the right most leaf-node argu-
ment. Some examples are shown below:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.854896727272727">
depart (go be (* thing 2)
(away_from loc (thing 2)
(at loc (thing 2)

insert (cause (* thing 1)
(go loc (* thing 2)

([at] loc (thing 2)
(thing 6) )))
( ! !+ingly 26))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.98496075">
Each of these telic verbs has a potential conn-
terpart with an atelic verb plus the requisite path.
Depart, for example, corresponds to move away, or
something similar in another language.
We therefore identify telic sentences by the algo-
rithm, formally specified in in Figure 1 (cf. (Dorr
and Olsen, 1997b) [156]).

Figure 1: Algorithm for Aspectual Feature Determi-
nation
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999605764705882">
This algorithm applies to the structural primitives
of the interlingua structure rather than actual verbs
in source or target language. The first step initial-
ized the aspectual values as unspecified: atelic
stative (not event: [-DI), and adurative [-R]. First
the top node is examined for primitives that indicate
felicity: if the top node is CAUSE, LET, co, telicity
is set to [+1], as with the verbs break, destroy, for
example. (The node is further checked for dynamic-
ity [-j-D] and durativity indicators, not in focus
in this paper.)If the top node is not a telic indicator
(i.e., the verb is a basically atelic predicate such as
love or run, telicity may still be still be indicated
by the presence of complement nodes of particular
types: e.g. a goal phrase (to primitive) in the case of
run. The same algorithm may be used to determine
telicity in either individual verbal entries (break but

not run) or composed sentences (John ran to the
store but not John ran.
Similar mismatches of telicity between represen-
tations of particular predicates can occur between
languages, although there is remarkable agreement
as to the set of templates that verbs with related
meanings will fit into (Olsen et al., 1998). In the
Chinese-English interlingual system we describe, the
Chinese is first mapped into the LCS, a language-
independent representation, from which the target-
language sentence is generated. Since telicity (and
other aspects of event structure) are uniformly rep-
resented at the lexical and the sentential level, telic-
ity mismatches between verbs of different languages
may then be compensated for by combining verbs
with other components.

4 Predictions

<bodyText confidence="0.999881333333333">
Based on (Dowty, 1986) and others, as discussed
above, we predict that sentences that have a telic
LCS will better translate into English as the past
tense, and those that lack telic identifiers will trans-
late as present tense. Moreover, we predict that
verbs in the main clause that are telic, will be past
with respect to their subordinates (X then Y). Verbs
in the main clause that are atelic we predict will tem-
porally overlap (X while Y).

5 Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9908273">
LeSes are used as the interlingua for our machine
translation efforts. Following the principles in (Don,
1993), lexical information and constraints on well-
formed LCSes are used to compose an LOS for a
complete sentence from a sentence parse in a source
language, This composed LCS (CLCS) is then used
as the starting points for generation into the target
language, using lexical information and constraints
for the target language.
The generation component consists of the follow-
ing subcomponents:
Decomposition and lexical selection First,
primitive LCSes for words in the target lan-
guage are matched against CLCSes, and tree
structures of covering words are selected. Am-
biguity in the input and analysis represented
in the CLCS is maintained (insofar as it is
possible to realize particular readings using the
target language lexicon), and new ambiguities
are introduced when there are different ways of
realizing a CLCS in the target language.
AMR Construction This tree structure is then
translated into a representation using the Aug-
mented Meaning Representation (AMR) syntax
of instances and hierarchical relations (Langk-
ilde and Knight, 1998a); however the rela-
tions include information present in the CLCS
and LeSes for target language words, including
theta roles, LCS type, and associated features.
Realization The AMR structure is then linearized,
as described in (Don et al., 1998), and mor-
phological realization is performed. The result
is a lattice of possible realizations, represent-
ing both the preserved ambiguity from previous
processing phases and multiple ways of lineariz-
ing the sentence.
Extraction The final stage uses a statistical hi-
gram extractor to pick an approximation of the
most fluent realization (Langkilde and Knight,
1998b).
While there are several possible ways to address
the tense and discourse connective issues mentioned
above, such as modifying the LOS primitive elements
and/or the composition of the LCS from the source
language, we instead have been experimenting for
the moment with solutions implemented within the
generation component. The only extensions to the
LCS language have been loosening of the constraint
against direct modification of states and events by
other states and events (thus allowing composed LC-
Sen to be formed from Chinese with these structures,
but creating a challenge for fluent generation into
English), and a few added features to cover some of
the discourse markers that are present. We are able
to calculate telicity of a CLOS, using the algorithm
in Figure 1 and encode this information as a binary
telic feature in the Augmented Meaning Represen-
tation (AMR).
The realization algorithm has been augmented
with the rules in (6)

7 Ground Truth
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996235">
To evaluate the extent to which our predictions re-
sult in an improvement in translation, we have used
a database of human translations of the sentences
in our corpus as the ground truth, or gold standard.
One of the translators is included among our au-
thors.
The ground truth data was created to provide a
fluid human translation of the text early in our sys-
tem development. It therefore includes many com-
plex tenses and multiple sentences combined, both
currently beyond the state of our system. Thus,
two of the authors and an additional researcher
also created a database of temporal relations among

event/state modifications. This was used to test pre-

ity. In evaluating our results, we concentrate on how
well the system did at matching past and present,

We have applied the rules in (6) in generating 80 sen-
tences in the corpus (starting from often ambiguous
CLCS analyses). Evaluation is still tricky, since, in
many cases, the interlingua analysis is incorrect or
ambiguous in ways that affect the appropriateness
of the generated translation.

previously constructed for these sentences. In many
cases, there is nothing overt in the sentence which
would specify tense, so a mismatch might not actu-
ally be &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot;. Also, there are a number of sen-
tences which were not directly applicable for com-
parison, such as when the human translator chose
a different syntactic structure or a complex tense.
The newspaper articles were divided into 80 sen-
tences. Since some of these sentences were conjunc-
tions, this yielded 99 tensed main verbs. These verbs
either appeared in simple present, past, present or
past perfect(&apos;has or had verb-eed), present or past
imperfective (is verb-Fing , was verb-Fing) and their
corresponding passive (is being kicked, was being
kicked, have been kicked) forms. For cases like the
present perfect (&apos;has kicked), we noted the intended
meaning ( e.g past activity) expressed by the verb
as well as the verb&apos;s actual present perfective form.
We scored the form as correct if the system trans-
lated a present perfective with past tense meaning
as a simple past or present perfective. There were
10 instances where a verb in the human translation
had no corresponding verb in the machine transla-
tion, either due to incorrect omission or correct sub-
stitution of the corresponding nominalization. We
excluded these forms from consideration. If the sys-
tem fails to supply a verb for independent reasons,
our system clearly can&apos;t mark it with tense. The
results of our evaluation are summarized in Table 2.
These results definitely improve over our previ-
ous heuristic, which was to always use past tense
(assuming this to be the default mode for newspa-
per article reporting). Results are also better than
always picking present tense. These results seem to
indicate that atelicity is a fairly good cue for present
tense. We also note that 8 out of the 14 cases where
the human translation used the present tense while
the system used past tense are headlines. Headlines
are written using the historical present in English
(&amp;quot;Man bites Dog&amp;quot;). These sentences would not be
incorrectly translated in the past (&amp;quot;The Man Bit
the Dog&amp;quot;) Therefore, a fairer judgement might leave
only remaining 6 incorrect cases in this cell. Using
atelicity as a cue for the present yields correct re-
sults approximately 65incorrect results 35worst case
results because they do not take into account pres-
ence or absence of the grammatical perfective and
progressive markers referred to in the introduction.

8.2 Relationship between clauses

Results are more preliminary for the clausal connec-
tives. Of the 80 sentences, 35 of them are flagged as
(possibly) containing events or states directly mod-
ifying other events or states. However, of this num-
ber, some actually do have lexical connectives repre-
sented as featural rather than structural elements in
the LCS, and can be straightforwardly realized using
translated English connectives such as since, after,
and if-then. Other apparently &amp;quot;modifying&amp;quot; events
or states should be treated as a complement rela-
tionship (at least according to the preferred reading
in ambiguous cases), but are incorrectly analyzed
as being in a non-complement relationship, or have
other structural problems rendering the interlingua
representation and English output not directly re-
lated to the original clause structure.
Of the remaining clear cases, six while relation-
ships were generated according to our heuristics, in-
dicating cotemporaneousness of main and modifying
situation, e.g. (7)a,h, in the automated translations
of (1) and (2), respectively. None were inappropri-
ate. Of the cases where then was generated, indicat-
ing sequential events, there were four cases in which
this was appropriate, and three cases in which the
situations really should have been cotemporaneous.
While these numbers are small, this preliminary data
seems to suggest again that atelicity is a good cue for
cotemporality, while telicity is not a sufficient cue.

We therefore conclude that lexical aspect can serve
as a valuable heuristic for suggesting tense, in the ab-
sence of tense and other temporal markers. We an-
ticipate incorporation of grammatical aspect infor-
mation to improve our temporal representation fur-
ther. In addition, lexical aspect, as represented by
the interlingual LCS structure, can serve as the foun-
dation for language specific heuristics. Furthermore,
the lexical aspect represented in the LCS can help to
provide the beginnings of cross-sentential discourse
information. We have suggested applications in the
temporal domain while, then. Causality is another
possible domain in which relevant pieces encoded in
sentence-level LCS structures could be used to pro-
vide links between LCSes/sentenees Thus, the in-
terlingual representation may be used to provide not
only shared semantic and syntactic structure, but
also the building blocks for language-specific heuris-
tics for mismatches between languages.

There are a number of other directions we intend to
pursue in extending this work. First, we will evalu-
ate the role of the grammatical aspect markers men-
tioned above, in combination with the telicity fea-
tures. Second, we will also examine the role of the
nature of the modifying situation. Third, we will
incorporate other lexical information present in the
sentence, including adverbial cue words (e.g. now,
already and specific dates that have time-related in-
formation, and distinguishing reported speech from
other sentences. Finally, as mentioned, these re-
sults do not take embedded verbs or verbs in adjunct
clauses into account. Many adjunct and embedded
clauses are tenseiess, making evaluation more diffi-
cult. For example, is The President believed China
to be a threat equivalent to The president believed
China is a threat).

<abstract confidence="0.996752666666667">Machine translation between any two languages requires the generation of information that is implicit in the source language. In translating from Chinese to English, tense and other temporal information must be inferred from other grammatical and lexical cues. Moreover, Chinese multiple-clause sentences may contain inter-clausal relations (temporal or otherwise) that must be explicit in English (e.g., by means of a discourse marker). Perfective and imperfective grammatical aspect markers can provide cues to temporal structure, but such information is not present in every sentence. We report on a project to use the lexical aspect features of (a)telicity reflected in the Lexical Conceptual Structure of the input text to suggest tense and discourse structure in the English translation of a Chinese newspaper corpus.</abstract>

Since imperfective aspect, such as the English PROGRESSIVE construction be VERB-ing, views a situation from within, it is often associated with present or contemporaneous time reference. On the other hand, perfective aspect, such as the English have VERB-ed, iiiews a situation as a whole; it is therefore often associated With past time reference ((Camre, 1976; Olsen, 1997; Smith, 1997) cf. (Chu, 1998)). The temporal relations are tendencies, rather than an absolute correlation: although the perfective is found more frequently in past tenses (Comrie, 1976), both imperfective and perfective cooccur in some language with past, present, and future tense. In some cases, an English verb will specify tense and/or aspect for a complement. For example, continue requires either an infinitive (3)a or progressive complement (3)b (and subject drop), while other verbs like say do not place such restrictions (3)c,d. (3) a.

Moreover, we predict that verbs in the main clause that are telic, will be past with respect to their subordinates (X then Y). Verbs in the main clause that are atelic we predict will temporally overlap (X while Y). 5 Implementation LeSes are used as the interlingua for our machine translation efforts. Following the principles in (Don, 1993), lexical information and constraints on wellformed LCSes are used to compose an LOS for a complete sentence from a sentence parse in a source language, This composed LCS (CLCS) is then used as the starting points for generation into the target language, using lexical information and constraints for the target language. The generation component consists of the following subcomponents: Decomposition and lexical selection First, primitive LCSes for words in the target language are matched against CLCSes, and tree structures of covering words are selected.

The feature specification of this compositionally derived accomplishment is therefore identical to that of a sentence containing a telic accomplishment verb, such as destroy. According to many researchers, knowledge of lexical aspect—how verbs denote situations as developing or holding in time—may be used to interpret event sequences in discourse (Dowty, 1986; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Passoneau, 1988). In particular, Dowty suggests that, absent other cues, a telic event is interpreted as completed before the next event or state, as with ran into the room in 4a; in contrast, atelic situations, such as run, was hungry in 4b and 4c, are interpreted as contemporaneous with the following situations: fell and made a pizza, respectively.

Since telicity (and other aspects of event structure) are uniformly represented at the lexical and the sentential level, telicity mismatches between verbs of different languages may then be compensated for by combining verbs with other components. 4 Predictions Based on (Dowty, 1986) and others, as discussed above, we predict that sentences that have a telic LCS will better translate into English as the past tense, and those that lack telic identifiers will translate as present tense. Moreover, we predict that verbs in the main clause that are telic, will be past with respect to their subordinates (X then Y).

Verbs that appear in multiple aspectual frames appear in multiple pairings between constants (representing the idiosyncratic meaning of the verb) and structures (the aspectual class). Since the aspectual templates may be realized in a variety of ways, other aspects of the structural meaning contribute to differentiating the verbs from each other. Our current database contains some 400 classes, based on an initial representation of the 213 classes in (Levin, 1993). Our current working lexicon includes about 10,000 English verbs and 18,000 Chinese verbs spread out into these classes. Telic verbs (and sentences) contain certain types of Paths, or a constant, represented by ! , filled by the verb constant, in the right most leaf-node argument.

In translating from Chinese to English, tense and other temporal information must be inferred from other grammatical and lexical cues. For example, Chinese verbs do not necessarily specify whether the event described is prior or cotemporaneous with the moment of speaking. While grammatical aspect information can be loosely associated with time, with imperfective aspect (Chinese l zaiand t -zhe) representing present time and perfective (Chinese 7 le) representing past time, (Chu, We gratefully acknowledge DOD support for this work through contract MDA904-96-R-0738 1998; Li and Thompson, 1981), verbs in the past do not need to have any aspect marking distinguishing them from present tense verbs. This is unlike English, which much more rigidly distinguishes past from present tense through use of suffixes. Thus, in order to generate an appropriate English sentence from its Chinese counterpart, we need to fill in a potentially unexpressed tense. Moreover, Chinese multiple-clause sentences may contain implicit relations between clauses (temporal or otherwise) that must be made explicit in English. These multiple-clause sentences are often most naturally translated into English includin</context>

Similar mismatches of telicity between representations of particular predicates can occur between languages, although there is remarkable agreement as to the set of templates that verbs with related meanings will fit into (Olsen et al., 1998).

Sentential representations derive from saturating the arguments required by the predicates in the sentence. LCS representations also include temporal information, where available in the source language: recent revisions include, for example (Dorr and Olsen, 1997a) standardizing LCS representations for the aspectual (un)boundedness ((a)TEmcITY) of events, either lexically or sententially represented. Although at present the LCS encodes no supra-sentential discourse relations, we show how the lexical aspect information may be used to generate discourse coherence in temporal structure. Relations between clauses as constrained by temporal reference has been examined in an LCS framework by Dorr and Caasterland (Dorr and Gaasterland, 1995).

Since imperfective aspect, such as the English PROGRESSIVE construction be VERB-ing, views a situation from within, it is often associated with present or contemporaneous time reference. On the other hand, perfective aspect, such as the English have VERB-ed, iiiews a situation as a whole; it is therefore often associated With past time reference ((Camre, 1976; Olsen, 1997; Smith, 1997) cf. (Chu, 1998)). The temporal relations are tendencies, rather than an absolute correlation: although the perfective is found more frequently in past tenses (Comrie, 1976), both imperfective and perfective cooccur in some language with past, present, and future tense. In some cases, an English verb will specify tense and/or aspect for a complement. For example, continue requires either an infinitive (3)a or progressive complement (3)b (and subject drop), while other verbs like say do not place such restrictions (3)c,d. (3) a.

<context position="12364" citStr="Olsen, 1997" startWordPosition="1964" endWordPosition="1965"> Lexical aspect refers to the type of situation denoted by the verb, alone or combined with other sentential constituents. Verbs are assigned to lexical aspect classes based on their behavior in a variety of syntactic and semantic frames that focus on three aspectual features: telicity, dynamicity and clurativity. We focus on telicity, also known as ROUNDEDNESS. Verbs that are telic have an inherent end: winning, for example, ends with the finish line. Verbs that are atelic do not name their end: running could end with a distance run a mile or an endpoint run to The store, for example. Olsen (Olsen, 1997) proposed that aspectual interpretation be derived through monotonic composition of marked privative features [+/0 dynamic], [+/(1 durative] and [+10 telic], as shown in Table 1 (Olsen, 1997, pp. 32-33). With privative features, other sentential constituents can add to features provided by the verb but not remove them.

Also, these tendencies are heuristic, and not absolute, as shown by the examples in (5).

Our current database contains some 400 classes, based on an initial representation of the 213 classes in (Levin, 1993). Our current working lexicon includes about 10,000 English verbs and 18,000 Chinese verbs spread out into these classes. Telic ver</context>

Such information can be used to help provide clues as to both tense and relationships (and cue words) between connected situations. Aspectual features can be divided into grammatical aspect, which is indicated by lexical or morphological markers in a sentence, and lexical aspect, which is inherent in the meanings of words. 2.1 Grammatical aspect Grammatical aspect provides a viewpoint on situation (event or state) structure (Smith, 1997). Since imperfective aspect, such as the English PROGRESSIVE construction be VERB-ing, views a situation from within, it is often associated with present or contemporaneous time reference. On the other hand, perfective aspect, such as the English have VERB-ed, iiiews a situation as a whole; it is therefore often associated With past time reference ((Camre, 1976; Olsen, 1997; Smith, 1997) cf. (Chu, 1998)). The temporal relations are tendencies, rather than an absolute correlation: although the perfective is found more frequently in past tenses (Comrie, 1976), both imperfective and perfective co</context>

In particular, Dowty suggests that, absent other cues, a telic event is interpreted as completed before the next event or state, as with ran into the room in 4a; in contrast, atelic situations, such as run, was hungry in 4b and 4c, are interpreted as contemporaneous with the following situations: fell and made a pizza, respectively. (4) a. Mary ran into the room. She turned on her w alk man b. Mary ran. She turned on her walkman. c. Mary was hungry. She made a pizza. Smith similarly suggests that in English all past events are interpreted as telic (Smith, 1997) (but cf. (Olsen, 1997)). Also, these tendencies are heuristic, and not absolute, as shown by the examples in (5). While we get the expected prediction that the jumping occurs after the explosion in (5)(a), we get the reverse prediction in (5)(b). Other factors such as consequences of described situations, discourse context, and stereotypical causal relationships also play a role. (5) a. The building exploded. Mary jumped. b. The building exploded. Chunks of concrete flew everywhere. 36 Aspectual CFass Telie Dynamic Durative Examples State + know, have Activity + + run, paint Accomplishment + </context>
