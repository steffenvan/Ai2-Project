We present the diverse research activities on
Philippine languages from all over the country,
with focus on the Center for Language Tech-
nologies of the College of Computer Studies,
De La Salle University, Manila, where major-
ity of the work are conducted. These projects
include the formal representation of Philippine
languages and the processes involving these
languages. Language representation entails
the manual and automatic development of lan-
guage resources such as lexicons and corpora
for various human languages including Philip-
pine languages, across various forms such as
text, speech and video files. Tools and appli-
cations on languages that we have worked on
include morphological processes, part of
speech tagging, language grammars, machine
translation, sign language processing and
speech systems. Future directions are also
presented.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.936431425531915">
The Philippines is an archipelagic nation in
Southeast Asia with more than 7,100 islands with
168 natively spoken languages (Gordon, 2005).
These islands are grouped into three main island
groups: Luzon (northern Philippines), Visayas
(central) and Mindanao (southern), and various
Philippine languages distributed among its is-
lands.
Little is known historically about these lan-
guages. The most concrete evidence that we
have is the Doctrina Christiana, the first ever
published work in the country in 1593 which
contains the translation of religious material in
the local Philippine script (the Alibata), Spanish
and old Tagalog (a sample page is shown in Fig-
ure 1, courtesy of the University of Sto. Tomas
Library, 2007). Alibata is an ancient Philippine
script that is no longer widely used except for a
few locations in the country. The old Tagalog
has evolved to the new Filipino alphabet which
now consists of 26 letters of the Latin script and
“ng” and “ii”.
The development of the national language can
be traced back to the 1935 Constitution Article
XIV, Section 3 which states that &amp;quot;...Congress
shall make necessary steps towards the develop-
ment of a national language which will be based
on one of the existing native languages...&amp;quot; due to
the advocacy of then Philippine President
Manuel L. Quezon for the development of a na-
tional language that will unite the whole country.
Two years later, Tagalog was recommended as
the basis of the national language, which was
later officially called Pilipino. In the 1987 Con-
stitution, Article XIV, Section 6, states that “the
National language of the Philippines is Filipino.
As it evolves, it shall be further developed and
enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and
other languages.” To date, Filipino that is being
taught in our schools is basically Tagalog, which
is the predominant language being used in the
archipelago.1

Linguistics information on Philippine lan-
guages are available, but as of yet, the focus has
been on theoretical linguistics and little is done
about the computational aspects of these lan-
guages. To add, much of the work in Philippine
linguistics focused on the Tagalog language (Li-
ao, 2006, De Guzman, 1978). In the same token,
NLP researches have been focused on Tagalog,
although pioneering work on other languages
such as Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, and
Tausug have been made. As can be noticed from
this information alone, NLP research on Philip-
pine languages is still at its infancy stage.
One of the first published works on NLP re-
search on Filipino was done by Roxas (1997) on
IsaWika!, a machine translation system involving
the Filipino language. From then on most of the
NLP researches have been conducted at the
Center for Language Technologies of the College
of Computer Studies, De La Salle University,
Manila, Philippines, in collaboration with our
partners in academe from all over the country.
The scope of experiments have expanded from
north of the country to south, from text to speech
to video forms, and from present to past data.
NLP researches address the manual construc-
tion of language resources literally built from
almost non-existent digital forms, such as the
grammar, lexicon, and corpora, augmented by
some automatic extraction algorithms. Various
language tools and applications such as machine
translation, information extraction, information
retrieval, and natural language database interface,
were also pursued. We will discuss these here,
the corresponding problems associated with the
development of these projects, and the solutions
provided. Future research plans will also be pre-
sented.

2 Language Resources
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938418604651">
We report here our attempts in the manual con-
struction of Philippine language resources such
as the lexicon, morphological information, gram-
mar, and the corpora which were literally built
from almost non-existent digital forms. Due to
the inherent difficulties of manual construction,
we also discuss our experiments on various tech-
nologies for automatic extraction of these re-
sources to handle the intricacies of the Filipino
language, designed with the intention of using
them for various language technology applica-
tions.
We are currently using the English-Filipino
lexicon that contains 23,520 English and 20,540
Filipino word senses with information on the part
of speech and co-occurring words through sam-
ple sentences. This lexicon is based on the dic-
tionary of the Commission on the Filipino Lan-
guage (Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino), and digi-
tized by the IsaWika project (Roxas, 1997). Ad-
ditional information such as synsetID from
Princeton WordNet were integrated into the lexi-
con through the AeFLEX project (Lim, et al.,
2007b). As manually populating the database
with the synsetIDs from WordNet is tedious,
automating the process through the SUMO (Sug-
gested Upper Merged Ontology) as an InterLin-
gua is being explored to come up with the Fili-
pino WordNet (Tan and Lim, 2007).
Initial work on the manual collection of docu-
ments on Philippine languages has been done
through the funding from the National Commis-
sion for Culture and the Arts considering four
major Philippine Languages namely, Tagalog,
Cebuano, Ilocano and Hiligaynon with 250,000
words each and the Filipino sign language with
7,000 signs (Roxas, et al., 2009). Computational
features include word frequency counts and a
concordancer that allows viewing co-occurring
words in the corpus. Mark-up conventions fol-
lowed some of those used for the ICE project.
Aside from possibilities of connecting the
Philippine islands and regions through language,

crossing the boundaries of time are one of the
goals (Roxas, 2007a; Roxas, 2007b). An unex-
plored but equally challenging area is the collec-
tion of historical documents that will allow re-
search on the development of the Philippine lan-
guages through the centuries, one of which is the
already mentioned Doctrina Christiana which
was published in 1593.
Attempts are being made to expand on these
language resources and to complement manual
efforts to build these resources. Automatic meth-
ods and social networking are the two main op-
tions currently being considered.

Automatic methods for bilingual lexicon ex-
traction, named-entity extraction, and language
corpora are also being explored to exploit on the
resources available on the internet. These auto-
matic methods are discussed in detail in this sec-
tion.
An automated approach of extracting bilingual
lexicon from comparable, non-parallel corpora
was developed for English as the source lan-
guage and Tagalog as the target language (Tiu
and Roxas, 2008). The study combined ap-
proaches from previous researches which only
concentrated on context extraction, clustering
techniques, or usage of part of speech tags for
defining the different senses of a word, and rank-
ing has shown improvement to overall F-measure
from 7.32% to 10.65% within the range of values
from previous studies. This is despite the use of
limited amount of corpora of 400k and seed lexi-
con of 9,026 entries in contrast to previous stud-
ies of 39M and 16,380, respectively.
The NER-Fil is a Named Entity Recognizer
for Filipino Text (Lim, et al., 2007a). This sys-
tem automatically identifies and stores named-
entities from documents, which can also be used
to annotate corpora with named-entity informa-
tion. Using machine learning techniques, named
entities are also automatically classified into ap-
propriate categories such as person, place, and
organization.
AutoCor is an automatic retrieval system for
documents written in closely-related languages
(Dimalen and Roxas, 2007). Experiments have
been conducted on four closely-related Philip-
pine languages, namely: Tagalog, Cebuano and
Bicolano. Input documents are matched against
the n-gram language models of relevant and ir-
relevant documents. Using common word prun-
ing to differentiate between the closely-related
Philippine languages, and the odds ratio query
generation methods, results show improvements
in the precision of the system.
Although automatic methods can facilitate the
building of the language resources needed for
processing natural languages, these automatic
methods usually employ learning approaches that
would require existing language resources as
seed or learning data sets.

2.2 Online Community for Corpora Build-
ing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989642857143">
PALITO is an online repository of the Philippine
corpus (Roxas, et al., 2009). It is intended to
allow linguists or language researchers to upload
text documents written in any Philippine lan-
guage, and would eventually function as corpora
for Philippine language documentation and re-
search. Automatic tools for data categorization
and corpus annotation are provided by the sys-
tem. The LASCOPHIL (La Salle Corpus of Phil-
ippine Languages) Working Group is assisting
the project developers of PALITO in refining the
mechanics for the levels of users and their corre-
sponding privileges for a manageable monitoring
of the corpora. Videos on the Filipino sign lan-
guage can also be uploaded into the system. Up-
loading of speech recordings will be considered
in the near future, to address the need to employ
the best technology to document and systemati-
cally collect speech recordings especially of
nearly extinct languages in the country. This
online system capitalizes on the opportunity for
the corpora to expand faster and wider with the
involvement of more people from various parts
of the world. This is also to exploit on the reality
that many of the Filipinos here and abroad are
native speakers of their own local languages or
dialects and can largely contribute to the growth
of the corpora on Philippine languages.

3 Language Tools
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967923076923">
Language tools are applications that support lin-
guistic research and processing of various lan-
guage computational layers. These include lexi-
cal units, to syntax and semantics. Specifically,
we have worked on the morphological processes,
part of speech tagging and parsing. These proc-
esses usually employ either the rule-based ap-
proach or the example-based approach. In gen-
eral, rule-based approaches capture language
processes by formally capturing these processes
which would require consultations and inputs
from linguists. On the other hand, example-
based approaches employ machine learning
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995219">

<bodyText confidence="0.999849">
methodologies where automatic learning of rules
is performed based on manually annotated data
that are done also by linguists.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998233">
3.1 Morphological Processes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980309859155">
We have tested both rule-based and example-
based approaches in developing our morphologi-
cal analyzers and generators. Rule-based mor-
phological analysis in the current methods, such
as finite-state and unification-based, are pre-
dominantly effective for handling concatenative
morphology (e.g. prefixation and suffixation),
although some of these techniques can also han-
dle limited non-concatenative phenomena (e.g.
infixation and partial and full-stem reduplication)
which are largely used in Philippine languages.
TagMA (Fortes-Galvan and Roxas, 2007) uses a
constraint-based method to perform morphologi-
cal analysis that handles both concatenative and
non-concatenative morphological phenomena,
based on the optimality theory framework and
the two-level morphology rule representation.
Test results showed 96% accuracy. The 4% error
is attributed to d-r alteration, an example of
which is in the word lakaran, which is from the
root word lakad and suffix -an, but d is changed
to r. Unfortunately, since all candidates are gen-
erated, and erroneous ones are later eliminated
through constraints and rules, time efficiency is
affected by the exhaustive search performed.
To augment the rule-based approach, an ex-
ample-based approach was explored by extend-
ing Wicentowski’s Word Frame model through
learning of morphology rules from examples
(Cheng and See, 2006). In the WordFrame
model, the seven-way split re-write rules com-
posed of the canonical prefix/beginning, point-
of-prefixation, common prefix substrings, inter-
nal vowel change, common suffix substring,
point-of-suffixation, and canonical suffix/ending.
Infixation, partial and full reduplication as in
Tagalog and other Philippine languages are im-
properly modeled in the WordFrame model as
point-of-prefixation as in the word (hin)-intay
which should have been modeled as the word
hintay with infix –in-. Words with an infix within
a prefix are also modeled as point-of-prefixation
as in the word (hini-)hintay which should be rep-
resented as infix –in in partial reduplicated sylla-
ble hi-. In the revised WordFrame model
(Cheng and See, 2006), the non-concatenative
Tagalog morphological behaviors such as infixa-
tion and reduplication are modeled separately
and correctly. Unfortunately, it is still not capa-
ble of fully modeling Filipino morphology since
some occurrences of reduplication are still repre-
sented as point-of-suffixation for various loca-
tions of the longest common substring. There are
also some problems in handling the occurrence
of several partial or whole-word reduplications
within a word. Despite these problems, the train-
ing of the algorithm that learns these re-write
rules from 40,276 Filipino word pairs derived
90% accuracy when applied to an MA. The
complexity of creating a better model would be
computationally costly but it would ensure an
increase in performance and reduced number of
rules.
Work is still to be done on exploring tech-
niques and methodologies for morphological
generation (MG). Although it could be inferred
that the approaches for MA can be extended to
handle MG, an additional disambiguation proc-
ess is necessary to choose the appropriate output
from the many various surface form of words
that can be generated from one underlying form.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999678">
3.2 Part of Speech Tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970214285714">
One of the most useful information in the lan-
guage corpora are the part of speech tags that are
associated with each word in the corpora. These
tags allow applications to perform other syntactic
and semantic processes. Firstly, with the aid of
linguists, a revised tagset for Tagalog has been
formulated (Miguel and Roxas, 2007), since a
close examination of the existing tagset for lan-
guages such as English showed the insufficiency
of this tagset to handle certain phenomena in
Philippine languages such as the lexical markers,
ligatures and enclitics. The lexical marker ay is
used in inverted sentences such as She is good
(Siya ay mabuti). Ligatures can take the form of
the word na or suffixes –ng (-g), the former is
used if the previous noun, pronoun or adjective
ends with a consonant (except for n), and the lat-
ter if the previous word ends with a vowel (or n).
Manual tagging of corpora has allowed the
performance of automatic experiments on some
approaches for tagging for Philippine languages
namely MBPOST, PTPOST4.1, TPOST and
TagAlog, each one exploring on a particular ap-
proach in tagging such as memory-based POS,
template-based and rule-based approaches. A
study on the performance of these taggers
showed accuracies of 85, 73, 65 and 61%, re-
spectively (Miguel and Roxas, 2007).

necessary. SpellCheF is a spell checker for Fili-
pino that uses a hybrid approach in detecting and
correcting misspelled words in a document
(Cheng, et al., 2007). Its approach is composed
of dictionary-lookup, n-gram analysis, Soundex
and character distance measurements. It is im-
plemented as a plug-in to OpenOffice Writer.
Two spelling rules and guidelines, namely, the
Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino 2001 Revision of
the Alphabet and Guidelines in Spelling the Fili-
pino Language, and the Gabay sa Editing sa Wi-
kang Filipino rulebooks, were incorporated into
the system. SpellCheF consists of the lexicon
builder, the detector, and the corrector; all of
which utilized both manually formulated and
automatically learned rules to carry out their re-
spective tasks.
FiSSAn, on the other hand, is a semantics-
based grammar checker. Lastly, PanPam (Jasa,
et al., 2007) is an extension of FiSSAn that also
incorporates a dictionary-based spell checker
(Borra, et al., 2007).
These systems make use of the rule-based ap-
proach. To complement these systems, an exam-
ple-based approach is considered through a
grammar rule induction method (Alcantara and
Borra, 2008). Constituent structures are auto-
matically induced using unsupervised probabilis-
tic approaches. Two models are presented and
results on the Filipino language show an F1
measure of greater than 69%. Experiments re-
vealed that the Filipino language does not follow
a strict binary structure as English, but is more
right-biased.
A similar experiment has been conducted on
grammar rule induction for the automatic parsing
of the Philippine component of the International
Corpus of English (ICE-PHI) (Flores and Roxas,
2008). The ICE-PHI corpora consist of English
texts with indigenous words and phrases during
speaker context switching. The markup language
followed the standards specified by the ICE
group, which is headed by ICE-GB. Constituent
rule induction is performed from manually en-
coded syntactically bracketed files from the ICE-
PHI, and will be used to parse the rest of the cor-
pus. Manual post editing of the parse will be
performed. The development of such tools will
directly benefit the descriptive and applied lin-
guistics of Philippine English, as well as other
Englishes, in particular, those language compo-
nents in the ICE.
Various applications on Philippine languages
have been created at the Center for Language
Technologies, College of Computer Studies, De
La Salle University to cater to different needs.

4 Language Applications
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.971254">
4.1 Machine Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99979218367347">
The Hybrid English-Filipino Machine Transla-
tion (MT) System is a three-year project (with
funding from the PCASTRD, DOST), which in-
volves a multi-engine approach for automatic
language translation of English and Filipino
Roxas, et al., 2008). The MT engines explore on
approaches in translation using a rule-based
method and two example-based methods. The
rule-based approach requires the formal specifi-
cation of the human languages covered in the
study and utilizes these rules to translate the in-
put. The two other MT engines make use of ex-
amples to determine the translation. The exam-
ple-based MT engines have different approaches
in their use of the examples (which are existing
English and Filipino documents), as well as the
data that they are learning.
The system accepts as input a sentence or a
document in the source language and translates
this into the target language. If source language
is English, the target language is Filipino, and
vise versa. The input text will undergo preproc-
essing that will include POS tagging and mor-
phological analysis. After translation, the output
translation will undergo natural language genera-
tion including morphological generation. Since
each of the MT engines would not necessarily
have the same output translation, an additional
component called the Output Modeler was cre-
ated to determine the most appropriate among the
translation outputs (Go and See, 2008). There
are ongoing experiments on the hybridization of
the rule-based and the template-based approaches
where transfer rules and unification constraints
are derived (Fontanilla and Roxas, 2008).
The rule-based MT builds a database of rules
for language representation and translation rules
from linguists and other experts on translation
from English to Filipino and from Filipino to
English. We have considered lexical functional
grammar (LFG) as the formalism to capture these
rules. Given a sentence in the source language,
the sentence is processed and a computerized
representation in LFG of this sentence is con-
structed. An evaluation of how comprehensive
and exhaustive the identified grammar is will be
considered. Is the system able to capture all pos-
sible Filipino sentences? How are all possible
sentences to be represented since Filipino exhib-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997804">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995985">
its some form of free word order in sentences?
The next step is the translation step, that is, the
conversion of the computerized representation of
the input sentence into the intended target lan-
guage. After the translation process, the comput-
erized representation of the sentence in the target
language will now be outputted into a sentence
form, or called the generation process. Although
it has been shown in various studies elsewhere
and on various languages that LFG can be used
for analysis of sentences, there is still a question
of whether it can be used for the generation proc-
ess. The generation involves the outputting of a
sentence from a computer-based representation
of the sentence. This is part of the work that the
group intends to address.
The major advantage of the rule-based MT
over other approaches is that it can produce high
quality translation for sentence patterns that were
accurately captured by the rules of the MT en-
gine; but unfortunately, it cannot provide good
translations to any sentence that go beyond what
the rules have considered.
In contrast to the rule-based MT which re-
quires building the rules by hand, the corpus-
based MT system automatically learns how
translation is done through examples found in a
corpus of translated documents. The system can
incrementally learn when new translated docu-
ments are added into the knowledge-base, thus,
any changes to the language can also be accom-
modated through the updates on the example
translations. This means it can handle translation
of documents from various domains (Alcantara,
et al., 2006).
The principle of garbage-in-garbage-out ap-
plies here; if the example translations are faulty,
the learned rules will also be faulty. That is why,
although human linguists do not have to specify
and come up with the translation rules, the lin-
guist will have to first verify the translated
documents and consequently, the learned rules,
for accuracy.
It is not only the quality of the collection of
translations that affects the overall performance
of the system, but also the quantity. The collec-
tion of translations has to be comprehensive so
that the translation system produced will be able
to translate as much types of sentences as possi-
ble. The challenge here is coming up with a
quantity of examples that is sufficient for accu-
rate translation of documents.
With more data, a new problem arises when
the knowledge-base grows so large that access to
it and search for applicable rules during transla-
tion requires tremendous amount of access time
and to an extreme, becomes difficult. Exponen-
tial growth of the knowledge-base may also hap-
pen due to the free word order nature of Filipino
sentence construction, such that one English sen-
tence can be translated to several Filipino sen-
tences. When all these combinations are part of
the translation examples, a translation rule will
be learned and extracted by the system for each
combination, thus, causing growth of the knowl-
edge-base. Thus, algorithms that perform gener-
alization of rules are considered to remove speci-
ficity of translation rules extracted and thus, re-
duce the size of the rule knowledge-base.
One of the main problems in language proc-
essing most especially compounded in machine
translation is finding the most appropriate trans-
lation of a word when there are several meanings
of source words, and various target word equiva-
lents depending on the context of the source
word. One particular study that focuses on the
use of syntactic relationships to perform word
sense disambiguation has been explored (Do-
mingo and Roxas, 2006). It uses an automated
approach for resolving target-word selection,
based on “word-to-sense” and “sense-to-word”
relationship between source words and their
translations, using syntactic relationships (sub-
ject-verb, verb-object, adjective-noun). Using
information from a bilingual dictionary and word
similarity measures from WordNet, a target word
is selected using statistics from a target language
corpus. Test results using English to Tagalog
translations showed an overall 64% accuracy for
selecting word translation.
Other attempts on MT are on Tagalog to Ce-
buano (Yara, 2007), and Ilocano to English (Mi-
guel and Dy, 2008). Both researches focus on
building the language resources for the languages
Cebuano and Ilocano, respectively, since focus
on the Philippine languages have so far been on
Tagalog. It is also important to note that these
contributions are local researches being done
where the languages are actually spoken and ac-
tively in usage.

<bodyText confidence="0.999853625">
Most of the work that we have done focused on
textual information. Recently, we have explored
on video and speech forms.
With the inclusion of the Filipino sign lan-
guage in a corpora building project (Roxas, et al.,
2009), video formats are used to record, edit,
gloss and transcribe signs and discourse. Video
editing merely cuts the video for final rendering,

glossing allows association of sign to particular
words, and transcription allows viewing of tex-
tual equivalents of the signed videos.
Work on the automatic recognition of Filipino
sign language involves digital signal processing
concepts. Initial work has been done on sign
language number recognition (Sandjaja, 2008)
using color-coded gloves for feature extraction.
The feature vectors were calculated based on the
position of the dominant-hand’s thumb. The sys-
tem learned through a database of numbers from
1 to 1000, and tested by the automatic recogni-
tion of Filipino sign language numbers and con-
version into text. Over-all accuracy of number
recognition is 85%.
Another proposed work is the recognition of
non-manual signals focusing on the various parts
of the face; in particular, initially, the mouth is to
be considered. The automatic interpretation of
the signs can be disambiguated using the inter-
pretation of the non-manual signals.

4.3 Speech Systems

<bodyText confidence="0.999975590909091">
PinoyTalk is an initial study on a Filipino-
based text to speech system that automatically
generates the speech from input text (Casas, et
al., 2004). The input text is processed and
parsed from words to syllables, from syllables to
letters, and assigned prosodic properties for each
one. Six rules for Filipino syllabication were
identified and used in the system. A rule-based
model for Filipino was developed and used as
basis for the implementation of the system. The
following were determined in the study consider-
ing the Filipino speaker: duration of each pho-
neme and silences, intonation, pitches of conso-
nants and vowel, and pitches of words with the
corresponding stress. The system generates an
audio output and able to save the generated file
using the mp3 or wav file format.
A system has been developed at the Digital
Signal Processing Laboratory at the University of
the Philippines at Diliman to automatically rec-
ognize emotions such as anger, boredom, happi-
ness and satisfaction (Ebarvia, et al., 2008).

Through the Center for Language Technologies
of the College of Computer Studies, De la Salle
University, and our partners, varied NLP re-
sources have been built, and applications and
researches explored. Our faculty members and
our students have provided the expertise in these
challenging endeavors, with multi-disciplinary
efforts and collaborations. Through our graduate
programs, we have trained many of the faculty
members of universities from various parts of the
country; thus, providing a network of NLP re-
searchers throughout the archipelago. We have
organized the National NLP Research Sympo-
sium for the past five years, through the efforts
of the CeLT of CCS-DLSU, and through the
support of government agencies such as
PCASTRD, DOST and CHED, and our industry
partners. Last year, we hosted an international
conference (the 22nd Pacific Asia Conference on
Language, Information and Computation) which
was held in Cebu City in partnership with
UPVCC and Cebu Institute of Technology. We
have made a commitment to nurture and
strengthen NLP researches and collaboration in
the country, and expand on our international
linkages with key movers in both the Asian re-
gion and elsewhere. For the past five years, we
have brought in and invited internationally-
acclaimed NLP researchers into the country to
support these endeavors. Recently, we have also
received invitations as visiting scholars, and par-
ticipants to events and meetings within the Asean
region which provided scholarships, which in
turn, we also share with our colleagues and re-
searchers in other Philippine universities.
It is an understatement to say that much has to
be explored in this area of research that inter-
leaves diverse disciplines among technology-
based areas (such as NLP, digital signal process-
ing, multi-media applications, and machine
learning) and other fields of study (such as lan-
guage, history, psychology, and education), and
cuts across different regions and countries, and
even time frames (Cheng, et al., 2008). It is
multi-modal and considers various forms of data
from textual, audio, video and other forms of
information. Thus, much is yet to be accom-
plished, and experts with diverse backgrounds in
these various related fields will bring this area of
research to a new and better dimension.

In contrast to the rule-based MT which requires building the rules by hand, the corpusbased MT system automatically learns how translation is done through examples found in a corpus of translated documents. The system can incrementally learn when new translated documents are added into the knowledge-base, thus, any changes to the language can also be accommodated through the updates on the example translations. This means it can handle translation of documents from various domains (Alcantara, et al., 2006). The principle of garbage-in-garbage-out applies here; if the example translations are faulty, the learned rules will also be faulty. That is why, although human linguists do not have to specify and come up with the translation rules, the linguist will have to first verify the translated documents and consequently, the learned rules, for accuracy. It is not only the quality of the collection of translations that affects the overall performance of the system, but also the quantity. The collection of translations has to be comprehensive so that the translation system produced will be able to tr</context>

The 4% error is attributed to d-r alteration, an example of which is in the word lakaran, which is from the root word lakad and suffix -an, but d is changed to r. Unfortunately, since all candidates are generated, and erroneous ones are later eliminated through constraints and rules, time efficiency is affected by the exhaustive search performed. To augment the rule-based approach, an example-based approach was explored by extending Wicentowski’s Word Frame model through learning of morphology rules from examples (Cheng and See, 2006). In the WordFrame model, the seven-way split re-write rules composed of the canonical prefix/beginning, pointof-prefixation, common prefix substrings, internal vowel change, common suffix substring, point-of-suffixation, and canonical suffix/ending. Infixation, partial and full reduplication as in Tagalog and other Philippine languages are improperly modeled in the WordFrame model as point-of-prefixation as in the word (hin)-intay which should have been modeled as the word hintay with infix –in-.

Thus, algorithms that perform generalization of rules are considered to remove specificity of translation rules extracted and thus, reduce the size of the rule knowledge-base. One of the main problems in language processing most especially compounded in machine translation is finding the most appropriate translation of a word when there are several meanings of source words, and various target word equivalents depending on the context of the source word. One particular study that focuses on the use of syntactic relationships to perform word sense disambiguation has been explored (Domingo and Roxas, 2006). It uses an automated approach for resolving target-word selection, based on “word-to-sense” and “sense-to-word” relationship between source words and their translations, using syntactic relationships (subject-verb, verb-object, adjective-noun). Using information from a bilingual dictionary and word similarity measures from WordNet, a target word is selected using statistics from a target language corpus. Test results using English to Tagalog translations showed an overall 64% accuracy for selecting word translation. Other attempts on MT are on Tagalog to Cebuano (Yara, 2007), and Ilocano to </context>

A similar experiment has been conducted on grammar rule induction for the automatic parsing of the Philippine component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-PHI) (Flores and Roxas, 2008). The ICE-PHI corpora consist of English texts with indigenous words and phrases during speaker context switching. The markup language followed the standards specified by the ICE group, which is headed by ICE-GB. Constituent rule induction is performed from manually encoded syntactically bracketed files from the ICEPHI, and will be used to parse the rest of the corpus.

Rule-based morphological analysis in the current methods, such as finite-state and unification-based, are predominantly effective for handling concatenative morphology (e.g. prefixation and suffixation), although some of these techniques can also handle limited non-concatenative phenomena (e.g. infixation and partial and full-stem reduplication) which are largely used in Philippine languages. TagMA (Fortes-Galvan and Roxas, 2007) uses a constraint-based method to perform morphological analysis that handles both concatenative and non-concatenative morphological phenomena, based on the optimality theory framework and the two-level morphology rule representation. Test results showed 96% accuracy. The 4% error is attributed to d-r alteration, an example of which is in the word lakaran, which is from the root word lakad and suffix -an, but d is changed to r.

These tags allow applications to perform other syntactic and semantic processes. Firstly, with the aid of linguists, a revised tagset for Tagalog has been formulated (Miguel and Roxas, 2007), since a close examination of the existing tagset for languages such as English showed the insufficiency of this tagset to handle certain phenomena in Philippine languages such as the lexical markers, ligatures and enclitics. The lexical marker ay is used in inverted sentences such as She is good (Siya ay mabuti). Ligatures can take the form of the word na or suffixes –ng (-g), the former is used if the previous noun, pronoun or adjective ends with a consonant (except for n), and the latter if the previous word ends with a vowel (or n).

The MT engines explore on approaches in translation using a rule-based method and two example-based methods. The rule-based approach requires the formal specification of the human languages covered in the study and utilizes these rules to translate the input. The two other MT engines make use of examples to determine the translation.

To add, much of the work in Philippine linguistics focused on the Tagalog language (Liao, 2006, De Guzman, 1978). In the same token, NLP researches have been focused on Tagalog, although pioneering work on other languages such as Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, and Tausug have been made. As can be noticed from this information alone, NLP research on Philippine languages is still at its infancy stage. One of the first published works on NLP research on Filipino was done by Roxas (1997) on IsaWika!, a machine translation system involving the Filipino language. From then on most of the NLP researches have been conducted at the Center for Language Technologies of the College of Computer Studies, De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines, in collaboration with our partners in academe from all over the country. The scope of experiments have expanded from north of the country to south, from text to speech to video forms, and from present to past data.

We are currently using the English-Filipino lexicon that contains 23,520 English and 20,540 Filipino word senses with information on the part of speech and co-occurring words through sample sentences. This lexicon is based on the dictionary of the Commission on the Filipino Language (Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino), and digitized by the IsaWika project (Roxas, 1997). Additional information such as synsetID from Princeton WordNet were integrated into the lexicon through the AeFLEX project (Lim, et al., 2007b). As manually populating the database with the synsetIDs from WordNet is tedious, automating the process through the SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) as an InterLingua is being explored to come up with the Filipino WordNet (Tan and Lim, 2007).

With the inclusion of the Filipino sign language in a corpora building project (Roxas, et al., 2009), video formats are used to record, edit, gloss and transcribe signs and discourse. Video editing merely cuts the video for final rendering, 136 glossing allows association of sign to particular words, and transcription allows viewing of textual equivalents of the signed videos. Work on the automatic recognition of Filipino sign language involves digital signal processing concepts. Initial work has been done on sign language number recognition (Sandjaja, 2008) using color-coded gloves for feature extraction. The feature vectors were calculated based on the position of the dominant-hand’s thumb. The system learned through a database of numbers from 1 to 1000, and tested by the automatic recognition of Filipino sign language numbers and conversion into text. Over-all accuracy of number recognition is 85%. Another proposed work is the recognition of non-manual signals focusing on the various parts of the face; in particular, initially, the mouth is to be considered.

Automatic methods and social networking are the two main options currently being considered. 2.1 Language Resource Builder Automatic methods for bilingual lexicon extraction, named-entity extraction, and language corpora are also being explored to exploit on the resources available on the internet. These automatic methods are discussed in detail in this section. An automated approach of extracting bilingual lexicon from comparable, non-parallel corpora was developed for English as the source language and Tagalog as the target language (Tiu and Roxas, 2008). The study combined approaches from previous researches which only concentrated on context extraction, clustering techniques, or usage of part of speech tags for defining the different senses of a word, and ranking has shown improvement to overall F-measure from 7.32% to 10.65% within the range of values from previous studies. This is despite the use of limited amount of corpora of 400k and seed lexicon of 9,026 entries in contrast to previous studies of 39M and 16,380, respectively.

It uses an automated approach for resolving target-word selection, based on “word-to-sense” and “sense-to-word” relationship between source words and their translations, using syntactic relationships (subject-verb, verb-object, adjective-noun). Using information from a bilingual dictionary and word similarity measures from WordNet, a target word is selected using statistics from a target language corpus. Test results using English to Tagalog translations showed an overall 64% accuracy for selecting word translation. Other attempts on MT are on Tagalog to Cebuano (Yara, 2007), and Ilocano to English (Miguel and Dy, 2008). Both researches focus on building the language resources for the languages Cebuano and Ilocano, respectively, since focus on the Philippine languages have so far been on Tagalog. It is also important to note that these contributions are local researches being done where the languages are actually spoken and actively in usage. 4.2 Sign Language Processing Most of the work that we have done focused on textual information.
