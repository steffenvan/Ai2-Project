This paper describes a new task to extract and
align information networks from comparable
corpora. As a case study we demonstrate the
effectiveness of this task on automatically
mining name translation pairs. Starting from a
small set of seeds, we design a novel approach
to acquire name translation pairs in a boot-
strapping framework. The experimental results
show this approach can generate highly accu-
rate name translation pairs for persons, geo-
political and organization entities.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9988725">
Accurate name translation is crucial to many
cross-lingual information processing tasks such
as information retrieval (e.g. Ji et al., 2008). Re-
cently there has been heightened interest in dis-
covering name pairs from comparable corpora
(e.g. Sproat et al., 2006; Klementiev and Roth,
2006). By comparable corpora we mean texts
that are about similar topics, but are not in gen-
eral translations of each other. These corpora are
naturally available, for example, many news
agencies release multi-lingual news articles on
the same day. There are no document-level or
sentence-level alignments across languages, but
important facts such as names, relations and
events in one language in such corpora tend to
co-occur with their counterparts in the other.

However, most of the previous approaches
used a phonetic similarity based name translitera-
tion module as baseline to generate translation
hypotheses, and then exploit the distribution evi-
dence from comparable corpora to re-score these
hypotheses. As a result, these approaches are
limited to names which are phonetically translit-
erated (e.g. translate Chinese name “,ttPR (You
shen ke)” to “Yushchenko” in English). But many
other types of names such as organizations are
often rendered semantically, for example, the
Chinese name “���� (jie fang zhi hu)” is
translated into “Liberation Tiger” in English.
Furthermore, many name translations are context
dependent. For example, a person name “EX
�·/�ls1:? ” should be translated into “Yasser
Arafat (PLO Chairman)” or “Yasir Arafat
(Cricketer)” based on different contexts.
Information extraction (IE) techniques – iden-
tifying important entities, relations and events –
are currently available for some non-English lan-
guages. In this paper we define a new notion ‘bi-
lingual information networks’ which can be ex-
tracted from comparable corpora. An information
network is a set of directed graphs, in which each
node is a named entity and the nodes are linked
by various ‘attributes’ such as hometown, em-
ployer, spouse etc. Then we align the informa-
tion networks in two languages automatically in
a bootstrapping way to discover name translation
pairs. For example, after we extract bilingual

we can discover name pairs of various types
(person, organization and location) while mini-
mizing using supervised name transliteration
techniques. At the same time, we can provide
links among names for entity disambiguation.

Figure 2 depicts the general procedure of our
approach. The language pair that we are consid-
ering in this paper is Chinese and English. We
apply IE techniques to extract information net-
works (more details in section 3), then use a
bootstrapping algorithm to align them and dis-
cover name pairs (section 4).

<bodyText confidence="0.9999126">
We apply a state-of-the-art bilingual information
extraction system (Chen and Ji, 2009; Ji and
Grishman, 2008) to extract ACE1 types of enti-
ties, relations and events from the comparable
corpora. Both systems include name tagging,

nominal mention tagging, coreference resolution,
time expression extraction and normalization,
relation extraction and event extraction. Entities
include persons, geo-political (GPE) and organi-
zations; Relations include 18 types (e.g. “a town
some 50 miles south of Salzburg” indicates a
located relation.); Events include the 33 distinct
event types defined in ACE05 (e.g. “Barry Dil-
ler on Wednesday quit as chief of Vivendi” indi-
cates that “Barry Diller” is the person argument
of a quit event occurred on Wednesday). The re-
lation extraction and event extraction compo-
nents produce confidence values.

<bodyText confidence="0.999952866666667">
Then we construct a set of directed graphs for
each language G = { Gi (Vi, Ei )} , where Vi is
the collection of named entities, and Ei is the
edges linking one name to the other, labeled by
the attributes derived from the following two
sources: (1) We select the relations with more
static types to form specific attributes in Table 22,
according to the entity types of a linked name
pair. (2) For each extracted event we compose an
attribute by combining its type and time argu-
ment (e.g. the “Arrest/2001-06-25” link in Figure
1). As we will see in the next section, these at-
tributes are the key to discover name translations
from the information networks because they are
language-independent.

4 Information Network Alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999836764705883">
After creating the information networks from
each language, we automatically align them to
discover name translation pairs. The general idea
is that starting from a small seed set of common
name pairs, we can rely on the link attributes to
align their related names. Then the new name
translations are added to the seed set for the next
iteration. We repeat this bootstrapping procedure
until no new translations are produced. We start
from names which are frequently linked to others
so that we can traverse through the information
networks efficiently. For example, the seed set in
processing ACE newswire data includes famous
names such as “Indonesia”, “China”, “Palestine”,
“Sharon” and “Yugoslavia”.
For each name pair &lt;CHName, EName&gt;, we
search for all its related pairs &lt;CHName’,

We use some documents from the ACE (2004,

manually evaluate our approach. Table 3 shows
the number of documents from different news
agencies and time frames. We hold out 20 ACE
texts from each language to optimize the thresh-
olds of confidence values in section 4. A name
pair &lt;CHName, EName&gt; is judged as correct if
both of them are correctly extracted and one is
the correct translation of the other in the certain
contexts of the original documents.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999794769230769">
One major evidence exploited in the prior work
is that the bilingual comparable corpora should
be weakly temporally aligned. For example,
Klementiev and Roth (2006) used the time dis-
tribution of names to re-score name translitera-
tion. In order to verify this observation, we in-
vestigated how well our new approach can per-
form on comparable corpora with different time
frames. Table 5 presents the performance of two
combinations: CHSet1-ENSet1 (from the same
time frame) and CHSet1-ENSet2 (from different
time frames) with a seed set of 10 name pairs
after 5 iterations.

In addition, in order to measure the impact of
news source similarity, we apply our approach to
the combination of CHSet3 and ENSet4 which
are from different news agencies. In total 815
name pairs are discovered after 4 iterations with
overall accuracy 78.7%, which is worse than the
results from the corpora of the same news source
as shown in Table 4. Therefore we can clearly
see that time and news source similarities are

5.4 Impact of IE Errors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982">
Since in our approach we used the fully auto-
matic IE pipeline to create the information net-
works, the errors from each component will be
propagated into the alignment step and thus limit
the performance of name translation discovery.
For example, Chinese name boundary detection
errors caused about 30% of the incorrect name
pairs. As a diagnostic analysis, we tried to dis-
cover name pairs from CHSet1 and ENSet1 but
with perfect IE annotations. We obtained 63
name pairs with a much higher accuracy 90.5%.

6 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940681818182">
Most of the previous name translation work
combined supervised transliteration approaches
with Language Model based re-scoring (e.g. Al-
Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Huang et al., 2004).
Ji et al. (2009) described various approaches to
automatically mine name translation pairs from
aligned phrases (e.g. cross-lingual Wikipedia
title links) or aligned sentences (bi-texts). Our
approach of extracting and aligning information
network from comparable corpora is related to
some prior work using comparable corpora to re-
score name transliterations (Sproat et al., 2006;
Klementiev and Roth, 2006).
In this paper we extend the target names from
persons to geo-political and organization names,
and extract relations links among names simulta-
neously. And we use a bootstrapping approach to
discover name translations from the bilingual
information networks of comparable corpora. In
this way we don’t need to have a name translit-
eration module to serve as baseline, or compute
document-wise temporal distributions.

7 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979846153846">
We have described a simple approach to create
bilingual information networks and then discover
name pairs from comparable corpora. The ex-
periments on Chinese and English have shown
that this method can generate name translation
pairs with high accuracy by using a small seed
set. In the short term, our approach will provide a
framework for many byproducts and directly
benefit other NLP tasks. For example, the
aligned sub-graphs with names, relations and
events can be used to improve information re-
dundancy in cross-lingual question answering;
the outlier (mis-aligned) sub-graphs can be used
to detect the novel or local information described
in one language but not in the other.
In the future we plan to import more efficient
graph mining and alignment algorithms which
have been widely used for protein-protein inter-
action detection (Kelley et al., 2003). In addition,
we will attempt using unsupervised relation ex-
traction based on lexical semantics to replace the
supervised IE pipeline. More importantly, we
will investigate the tradeoff between coverage
and accuracy by applying the generated name
pairs to cross-lingual name search and machine
translation tasks.

The language pair that we are considering in this paper is Chinese and English. We apply IE techniques to extract information networks (more details in section 3), then use a bootstrapping algorithm to align them and discover name pairs (section 4). Figure 2. Name Translation Mining Overview 3 Information Network Creation 3.1 Bilingual Information Extraction We apply a state-of-the-art bilingual information extraction system (Chen and Ji, 2009; Ji and Grishman, 2008) to extract ACE1 types of entities, relations and events from the comparable corpora. Both systems include name tagging, 1 http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig//tests/ace/ nominal mention tagging, coreference resolution, time expression extraction and normalization, relation extraction and event extraction. Entities include persons, geo-political (GPE) and organizations; Relations include 18 types (e.g. “a town some 50 miles south of Salzburg” indicates a located relation.); Events include the 33 distinct event types defined in ACE05 (e.g. “Barry Diller on Wednesday quit as chief of Vivendi” indica</context>

After four iterations we discovered 968 new name translation pairs with accuracy 82.9%.

Overall Performance 5.3 Impact of Time Frame and News Source Similarity One major evidence exploited in the prior work is that the bilingual comparable corpora should be weakly temporally aligned. For example, Klementiev and Roth (2006) used the time distribution of names to re-score name transliteration. In order to verify this observation, we investigated how well our new approach can perform on comparable corpora with different time frames. Table 5 presents the performance of two combinations: CHSet1-ENSet1 (from the same time frame) and CHSet1-ENSet2 (from different time frames) with a seed set of 10 name pairs after 5 iterations.
