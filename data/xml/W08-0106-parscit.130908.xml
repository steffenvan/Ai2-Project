Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9991248">
A key problem for models of dialogue is to
explain how semantic co-ordination in dia-
logue is achieved and sustained. This paper
presents findings from a series of Maze Task
experiments which are not readily explained
by the primary co-ordination mechanisms of
existing models. It demonstrates that align-
ment in dialogue is not simply an outcome of
successful interaction, but a communicative
resource exploited by interlocutors in con-
verging on a semantic model. We argue this
suggests mechanisms of co-ordination in dia-
logue which are of relevance for a general ac-
count of how semantic co-ordination is
achieved.

One of the first things apparent to European trav-
ellers on arriving at an American hotel is that the
ground floor is also the first floor. Any confusion
can be quickly corrected by an observant
concierge, whether by explicitly stating the con-
vention, or by implicitly bypassing the problem
with a different description, such as “go up 5
flights of stairs”. Assuming this description is suf-
ficient to guide the hapless traveller to the correct
room, when the same traveller asks for assistance
to find another part of the hotel, the concierge is
faced with a choice of whether to give a descrip-
tion involving floor numbers or in terms of flights
of stairs.

The immediate question that emerges is what
motivates this choice between different semantic
models of a domain, how they are deployed when
interlocutors are faced with problematic under-
standing, and which semantic model is subsequent-
ly used once the problem is resolved. Although ex-
isting approaches to dialogue agree that answering
this question necessarily involves focusing on the
interactional devices available to interlocutors,
their primary emphasis is on the information-ex-
change aspects of language use. Larsson (2007)
provides a useful distinction between the co-ordi-
nation of information, i.e. establishing common
ground (Clark, 1996) and the co-ordination of lin-
guistic resources which are adapted to suit particu-
lar communicative situations in order to make such
information-exchange possible. Part of this frame-
work involves interlocutors negotiating which par-
ticular semantic model to use, and adapting their
own interpretations on the basis of successful/un-
succesful use. However, although this framework
sketches out a formal account of the mechanisms
involved in this process, it is not concerned with
predicting which particular semantic model will be
adopted by interlocutors.
A model of dialogue which attempts to address
this issue is the interactive alignment model of
Pickering and Garrod (2004). In this model conver-
gence on a semantic model is arrived at via tacit
priming occurring at all levels of representation
(phonetic, phonological, lexical, syntactic, seman-
tic and situational): interlocutors are more likely to
re-use the representations used by their partner,
giving rise to a “winner-takes-all” dynamic (cf.
Steels &amp; Belpaeme, 2005) which leads to align-

ment of interlocutors&apos; representations. This is fur-
ther re-inforced by “percolation” occurring be-
tween levels, thus lexemes associated with particu-
lar semantic models will reinforce the use of these
models.
The claims associated with the interactive align-
ment model (henceforth IM) are drawn from a se-
ries of maze task experiments (Garrod &amp; Doherty
1994; Garrod and Anderson, 1987; Anderson and
Garrod, 1987). This paper discusses some of the
original findings of these experiments and a further
set of maze task experiments conducted by Healey
and Mills (2006), Mills and Healey (2006). These
papers argued that the primary mechanisms provid-
ed by the IM are insufficient for explaining ob-
served patterns in maze task dialogue; in particular
how semantic co-ordination is achieved. The
present paper argues that interlocutors in the Maze
task exploit variation in usage in the service of se-
mantic co-ordination. Furthermore we argue this
suggests mechanisms which are relevant for a gen-
eral account of how semantic co-ordination is
achieved in dialogue. As the claims developed here
are based on the maze task, we first explain the
task in more detail. We then discuss a series of ex-
amples drawn from this task that raise basic issues
for models of semantic co-ordination.

2 The maze task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99422246875">
The maze task developed by Garrod et al involves
pairs of participants seated in separate rooms in
front of a computer which displays a simple maze
consisting of interconnected nodes (see Fig 1).
Participants must move their respective position
markers through the maze in order to reach a
“goal” node. Some of the paths are blocked by
gates, which are opened by participants guiding
each other onto “switch” nodes (shaded areas).
This provides participants with the recurrent co
-ordination problem of collaboratively individuat-
ing and referring to maze locations in order to
solve the maze. The descriptions used by partici-
pants to refer to maze locations are classified by
Garrod et al. into four distinct types:
Figural: Picks out salient features of the maze:
“The l-shape sticking out at the top”
“The uppermost box”
Path: Traces a route along the connections
between nodes:
“Go 2 up, 1 down, 3 along, 5 up”
“up, right, down, up ”
Line: Treats the maze as consisting of hori-
zontal or vertical vectors:
“3rd row, 5th box”
“4th column, second square”
Matrix: Cartesian co-ordinate system:
“4,2”
“A1”
It is assumed that these different description types
correspond to different semantic models of the
maze.

The first question, also raised by Healey and Mills
(2006), concerns the tension between the interac-
tive alignment model&apos;s inherently conservative pri-
mary co-ordination mechanism and the migration
in description types commonly observed in the
Maze task. To the extent that it relies on priming
as its basic mechanism the IM cannot provide an
account of how once a convention is established
and used successfully, it might be supplanted by

another.. However, it is consistently observed that
the description types used most frequently initially
fall into disuse and are not converged on in later
games. Across trials there is a general shift from
more “concrete” (Figural and Path) descriptions to-
wards more “abstract” (Line and Matrix) descrip-
tions, which runs counter to precedence. A typical
pattern of the shift is given in table 1, below:

Garrod (1999) discusses this process as an “explo-
ration” process. However, this, in itself, doesn&apos;t ex-

the experiments.

4 Variation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983515151515">
The early explanations of co-ordination in the
Maze Task also emphasized the importance of
variation in the description types participants are
exposed to. Garrod and Doherty (1994) assigned
participants to one of three different groups: (1)
isolated pairs who always interacted with the same
partner in subsequent games, (2) a sub-community
group whose members changed partners in each
game, only interacting with members from the
same sub-community, and (3) a non-community
group whose members always interacted with a
new partner who was not drawn from the same
community. Although initially pairs in the sub-
community group were less co-ordinated than the
isolated pairs, using a wider variety of referring ex-
pressions, by the later trials, this pattern was re-
versed: participants in the sub-community group
had converged on a single Matrix scheme and con-
sistently matched each other&apos;s descriptions.
These findings present a problem for accounts of
co-ordination which rely on priming, as they make
the emphasis of the priority of alignment of repre-
sentations at all levels problematic. The metaphor
of two tightly-coupled production and comprehen-
sion systems is the paradigm case of successful co-
ordination, as it allows rapid priming between in-
terlocutors&apos; representations. However, these exper-
iments show weaker semantic co-ordination in the
isolated dyads than within the group. As Garrod
and Doherty (1994) concur, this implies that varia-
tion, i.e. differences in interlocutors&apos; representa-
tions is important for establishing and sustaining
semantic co-ordination.

<bodyText confidence="0.999909379310345">
If variation of description types is intrinsic to the
development of semantic co-ordination, this
strongly suggests the importance of mechanisms
involved in dealing with problematic understand-
ing (Healey, forthcoming). All things being equal,
variation increases the likelihood that interlocutors
will encounter others whose use of language will
differ more from their own. Further, any account of
misunderstandings must also be able to address se-
mantic differences between descriptions: partici-
pants in the maze task do not treat these four de-
scription types equally, and consequently are not
appropriately modelled as co-ordination equilibria
of the kind described by Lewis (1968) (Healey,
2004; forthcoming). Existing experimental data
shows that participants systematically favour Figu-
ral and Path descriptions when encountering prob-
lematic dialogue (Mills and Healey, 2006; Healey,
1997) not the prior most frequently used semantic
model as predicted by the IM.
Looking more closely at the dialogues, it is not
clear that the co-ordination mechanisms actually
operate directly at the level of the four basic se-
mantic models. Consider the following excerpt in
which a participant encounters difficulties with a
Line description type and its associated counting
conventions. The dialogue continues with more
Figural descriptions, before resuming at turn (35)
with a Line description:

Excerpt 1: Deletion of elements from problem-
atic turn.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999373791666667">
While superficially, A&apos;s turn at (3) appears sim-
ply as a repeat of (1), with “on the right” being
omitted, the subsequent turns continue with Figural
descriptions. On this basis, it is unclear whether (1)
and (3) invoke the same Line model or whether (3)
invokes a Figural description. There is a large class
of similar clarification sub-dialogues which in-
volve deletion of a problematic element and result
in the continuation of the dialogue with more Figu-
ral descriptions.
This issue is of importance for any theory of
semantic co-ordination as it raises the question of
the granularity of the mechanisms involved in how
interlocutors collaboratively change semantic mod-
el. Further, it strongly suggests that alignment is
not simply an outcome of successful communica-
tion, but can provide the background against which
other co-ordination mechanisms operate. Turns
(1)-(6) demonstrate high levels of between-speaker
alignment, while at the same time involving a shift
in semantic model. Before returning to this below,
we demonstrate further differences between the in-
formational view of language and an account
which focuses on semantic co-ordination.

6 Information vs. semantic co-ordination
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991317073171">
From an informational perspective, if an utterance
fails to secure reference, there is the general as-
sumption that more information will be provided to
allow resolution of the problem. However, in (3),
no new information is provided by A. This is a
counter-example to Clark and Marshall&apos;s (1981)
model of definite reference repair, which states that
to be effective “repair must add or alter descrip-
tors, but not delete them”. Importantly, these CR
responses that simply delete elements from the tar-
get turn are not treated by participants as repeats
and queried again, but appear to promote resolu-
tion of the problematic understanding by engender-
ing the use of more Figural descriptions. The
words which are omitted do not appear, as with the
level of description types, to be dictated by prior
frequency of use (Mills, 2007). Instead, the data
suggest that this pattern is motivated by a relax-
ation of the constraints of successful interpretation
(Healey and Mills, 2006).
The example above raises a further question
concerning the relationship between semantic co-
ordination and the exchange of information. In ex-
isting “ladder models” of communication such as
the collaborative model of Clark (1996) and All-
wood (1995), there is the general expectation that
on encountering and signalling problematic under-
standing, interlocutors enter a sub-dialogue to re-
solve the problem, which on completion proceeds
at the same “level”. From this perspective, B&apos;s
turn-initial acknowledgment at (4) should demar-
cate the end of the sub-dialogue dealing with the
problematic understanding. Focusing on the de-
scription types, however, shows that it is only at
turn (35) that the interlocutors return to using the
original problematic line description; the semantic
effects persist beyond the immediate sub-dialogue.
This highlights the inadequacy of a strict informa-
tional view of language as the response provides
no additional information, yet still has the effect of
resolving the misunderstanding.

7 Exploitation of alignment: patterns of
deletion, modification and addition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913142857143">
In addition to deletion of elements contained in re-
ferring expressions, the maze task dialogues exhib-
it a multiplicity of ways in which interlocutors
modify descriptions when dealing with problemat-
ic understanding, through the addition, substitution
and (as described above) deletion of elements of
semantic models. We argue that alignment is key
to these patterns of modification, as it provides a
backdrop against which changes can be made.
The canonical example of this is embedded correc-
tion (Jefferson, 1983; Saxton, 2007) which exploits
the structure provided by alignment to make a fig-
ure / ground distinction that allows the corrected
element to be identified:

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999100615384615">
Embedded corrections in the maze task exhibit
very high levels of between-speaker alignment, yet
occur at points in the dialogue where there is prob-
lematic understanding. This indicates that align-
ment can not simply be reduced to an index of suc-
cessful communication. While this particular con-
versational device which spans 2 turns (and possi-
bly a third) has received much attention, closer in-
spection of the maze task dialogues reveal a far
larger space of possible means of exploiting align-
ment. Excerpt 1 above showed deletions, Excerpt 2
substitutions, however a similar pattern also ap-
pears with the addition of Figural elements.

top

....
(23) B: am on the top row 3rd square
Excerpt 3: Addition of “Figural” elements.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952673076923">
At a first glance, this excerpt looks like a
straightforward clarification request followed by
the provision of more details, specifying that the
“5th square” is also “the end bit”. B&apos;s use of
“cheers” in (4) and subsequent provision of her
own maze location would appear to demarcate the
end of the clarification sequence, as they provide
an acknowledgment and a “next relevant contribu-
tion” (Clark, 1996). However, focusing on the en-
suing turns yields a pattern that parallels the first
example. The semantic effects stretch beyond the
immediate clarification sub-dialogue: both inter-
locutors continue with more Figural descriptions
until turn (23) where the original, problematic Line
description is attempted again.
A further issue emerges when interlocutors fi-
nally re-use the original description, as in turn (23)
of Excerpt 1, and (35) above: although the surface
form of the descriptions are similar, this does not
necessarily entail that they individuate the same lo-
cations. For example, the counting conventions as-
sociated with squares may change, such as count-
ing from the left instead of the right or counting
from 0 as opposed to 1, similar to the concierge ex-
ample above. The axes may also change, with
“rows” referring to vertical vectors (i.e. columns).
This raises important questions of the relation-
ship between the problematic utterance, the sig-
nalling of the problem, the response, the ensuing
figural sub-dialogue and the subsequent return to
the superficially similar but potentially altered de-
scription type. It appears that alignment is not sim-
ply an outcome but an interactional resource that
is exploited to facilitate the continuation with more
Figural descriptions (cf. Saxton, 2007).
In the first excerpt, turns (1) and (3) only differ
minimally from each other, while in the second ex-
ample, turn (3) can be seen to be operating ellipti-
cally on turn (1). However, both engender similar
semantic shifts towards Figural descriptions and
result in a return to the originally problematic Line
description.
This leads to the immediate question of what
motivates interlocutors&apos; patterns of alignment and
modification, and how they reflect differences of
understanding and diagnosis of the problem. The
tacit and fine-grained nature of these modifications
exacerbates the problem of arriving at a prelimi-
nary taxonomy, as these dialogue sequences are
not readily categorizable as either “elaborations” or
“reformulations” (cf. Purver et al., 2004,
Schlangen 2004).

8 Boundary of (mis)communication
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999405">
During the course of maze task dialogues, partici-
pants shift seamlessly and tacitly from one descrip-
tion type to another. This occurs both within prob-
lematic and unproblematic dialogue. From an in-
formational perspective, miscommunication is
readily describable as a form of mismatch, yet
from a semantic perspective, participants match
each other more when encountering difficulties.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.9906">
50
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851909090909">
Thus alignment cannot be taken as a straightfor-
ward index of successful interaction.
This also raises a methodological point. Mea-
sures of matching of representations, whether at
the level of description type or its constituent ele-
ments are only an approximate index of semantic
co-ordination. The excerpts above demonstrate the
importance of the interplay between what is re-
tained and what is modified. What is required is a
measure that is sensitive to the kind of model being
used and the kind of repair being performed.
In addition, more frequent repair does not nec-
essarily entail that a dialogue is unsuccessful. It is
not the case that interlocutors introduce their utter-
ances carefully, and once they are sufficiently co-
ordinated, move on. The general pattern is that
when participants introduce abstract (Line and Ma-
trix) descriptions, they do so opportunistically. At
the start of the games they frequently attempt both
Line and Matrix descriptions, which are associated
with higher co-ordination. However, there is evi-
dence that it is only where they can go through the
process of detecting and responding to differences
in usage, i.e. repair, that co-ordination develops
(Healey and Mills, 2006).
If the boundary between description types and
also the boundary between successful and unsuc-
cessful use can be as porous as demonstrated in the
excerpts above, this also suggests a more complex
picture of referential contraction (Krauss and
Weinheimer, 1966) than provided by current mod-
els of dialogue. In current models this is primarily
associated with successful use: in the collaborative
model, interlocutors follow the principle of “least
collaborative effort” (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs,
1986), whereby successful use sets a precedent for
an expression; co-ordination on precedence allows
interlocutors to delete elements of the description
on successive mention. It is assumed that the infor-
mation associated with these deleted elements that
are no longer on the conversational surface can be
re-accessed in the common ground and mentioned
explicitly, e.g. to assist disambiguation.
By contrast, the phenomena from the maze task
show how similar processes are operative during
problematic dialogue, raising further questions
concerning the difference between elements that
are removed in successful, as opposed to problem-
atic dialogue and where this boundary lies.
Larsson&apos;s model of semantic co-ordination
places a strong emphasis on the role of feedback in
negotiating this boundary in terms of appropriate-
ness gleamed from feedback (e.g. repair, acknowl-
edgements etc..), and provides a schema which an-
alyzes the effects of novel uses of a word and the
subsequent update of interlocutors&apos; representations.
Findings from the maze task experiments aug-
ment this approach as they suggest that evidence
of appropriateness is also derived in the absence of
overt repair from semantic change alone. The ex-
cerpts indicate that interlocutors are sensitive to
which particular tacit shift in model leads to a re-
laxation of the constraints on successful communi-
cation, and consequently can be exploited to indi-
cate problematic understanding (Mills, 2007). For
example, consider the following two excerpts:

Excerpts 4, 5: Provision of feedback
If the dialogue continues successfully in both these
instances, it is unclear how to adequately capture
the differences between them, in particular, how
both patterns affect subsequent use of the descrip-
tion types,
One of the main challenges facing an account of
semantic co-ordination is teasing apart how inter-
locutors&apos; models are affected by both semantic
change exploited as a resource using the mecha-
nisms of alignment outlined above, and feedback
concerning that change, as both aspects inhabit the
boundary between successful and unsuccessful use.
Evidence from the maze task suggests this
boundary is one of the important locii in the devel-
opment of semantic co-ordination.

To describe how interlocutors dynamically adapt
the meanings of the words they use to the commu-
nicative situation and how they are shaped
throughout the course of the dialogue, Larsson
(2006) introduces the notion of “semantic plastici-

ty”. This model is sensitive to the fact that descrip-
tions can involve a plethora of different “ad-hoc
registers”, which resonates strongly with the em-
pirical phenomena described here. However, the
data from all the maze task experiments presents a
further problem for attempts to model these phe-
nomena, as successful co-ordination on the more
specific abstract levels appears to be predicated
upon prior successful use of less specific Figural
descriptions: the Figural descriptions are highly
specific to individual mazes and allow participants
to co-ordinate on their salient features, whereas the
Line and Matrix descriptions abstract away from
each individual instance to form dyad-specific con-
ceptualizations of vectors and their associated
counting conventions.
While Larsson&apos;s account highlights the sheer
flexibility of ways in which linguistic resources are
mobilized and adapted to particular interaction set-
tings, the data from the maze task suggest an addi-
tional level of complexity. Namely that the seman-
tic resources can not be treated as separate, essen-
tially equal encyclopaedias that interlocutors draw
on. One way in which the cumulative shift toward
Matrix descriptions is achieved is by the combina-
tion of different “registers” (Larsson 2007) to form
a super-ordinate one. Here the question concerns
which specific features of each semantic model are
included in the final one, in particular when there
are problems of commensurability. For example, as
table 1 shows, a common pattern in maze task dia-
logues is that approximately half-way through the
dialogues participants use “Line” descriptions. It
can occur that they alternate between describing
the maze as consisting of vertical and horizontal
vectors, say with one participant favouring hori-
zontal and the other favouring vertical vectors
(space considerations preclude a throrough exami-
nation of this process, described in Mills, 2007). It
frequently occurs that Matrix descriptions emerge
when these two different Line models are com-
bined to form a Matrix description. This process,
however, is not as a rule simply a matter of com-
bining the two. Frequently, the two types of Line
description employ different counting conventions,
as in the example of the concierge above, giving
rise to the problem of whether to retain different
counting conventions for the different axes, or em-
ploy the same one. The question then emerges as
to how this super-ordinate, more abstract semantic
model affects the original models.
Results from the maze task suggest this is
achieved tacitly by interlocutors, employing simi-
lar patterns of modification to those described in
the excerpts above (Mills, 2007).

<bodyText confidence="0.999925795454546">
The phenomena described here demonstrate the
need for an account of semantic co-ordination that
explains how interlocutors converge on a semantic
representation. Dialogues from the maze task pro-
vide compelling evidence that such an account
must necessarily be able to account for how varia-
tion, and hence differences in semantic models are
resolved. This approach necessarily involves shift-
ing the focus from an informational view of lan-
guage towards a focus on how interlocutors actual-
ly address these differences.
In a sense, this presents a reversal of the priori-
ties of existing models. For the interactive align-
ment model, as well as the collaborative model,
misunderstanding is seen as a secondary problem
that emerges as a complication of communication
which is ordinarily successful (Healey, 2004;
forthcoming). The collaborative model explicitly
states that in order for communication to be suc-
cessful, positive evidence of understanding must
be demonstrated.
By contrast, the view presented here brings
problematic understanding into the foreground, as
it is in such instances, when conventions don&apos;t
work as expected, that interlocutors gain a sense of
their applicability. The phenomena presented here
suggest that the processes operating in instances of
misunderstanding are as much progenitors of se-
mantic co-ordination, as their traditional counter-
part of displays of positive understanding. Inter-
locutors&apos; separate interaction histories inescapably
give rise to problems concerning the development
and sustenance of mutual-intelligibility, intrinsical-
ly requiring interlocutors to resolve differences of
semantic model in interaction. The data from the
maze task experiments demonstrate how this can
be achieved through tacitly modifying the con-
stituents of semantic models. This modification in-
volves the exploitation of alignment, and has the
effect of relaxing the constraints on successful un-
derstanding.
Any theory of dialogue must, in the first in-
stance be concerned with what interlocutors actual-
ly do. The phenomena presented here demonstrate

<abstract confidence="0.9956634375">A key problem for models of dialogue is to explain how semantic co-ordination in dialogue is achieved and sustained. This paper presents findings from a series of Maze Task experiments which are not readily explained by the primary co-ordination mechanisms of existing models. It demonstrates that alignment in dialogue is not simply an outcome of successful interaction, but a communicative resource exploited by interlocutors in converging on a semantic model. We argue this suggests mechanisms of co-ordination in dialogue which are of relevance for a general account of how semantic co-ordination is achieved.</abstract>

The example above raises a further question concerning the relationship between semantic coordination and the exchange of information. In existing “ladder models” of communication such as the collaborative model of Clark (1996) and Allwood (1995), there is the general expectation that on encountering and signalling problematic understanding, interlocutors enter a sub-dialogue to resolve the problem, which on completion proceeds at the same “level”. From this perspective, B&apos;s turn-initial acknowledgment at (4) should demarcate the end of the sub-dialogue dealing with the problematic understanding.

Garrod (1999) discusses this process as an “exploration” process. However, this, in itself, doesn&apos;t explain the systematic patterns of change observed in the experiments. 4 Variation The early explanations of co-ordination in the Maze Task also emphasized the importance of variation in the description types participants are exposed to. Garrod and Doherty (1994) assigned participants to one of three different groups: (1) isolated pairs who always interacted with the same partner in subsequent games, (2) a sub-community group whose members changed partners in each game, only interacting with members from the same sub-community, and (3) a non-community group whose members always interacted with a new partner who was not drawn from the same community. Although initially pairs in the subcommunity group were less co-ordinated than the isolated pairs, using a wider variety of referring expressions, by the later trials, this pattern was reversed: participan</context>

These findings present a problem for accounts of co-ordination which rely on priming, as they make the emphasis of the priority of alignment of representations at all levels problematic. The metaphor of two tightly-coupled production and comprehension systems is the paradigm case of successful coordination, as it allows rapid priming between interlocutors&apos; representations. However, these experiments show weaker semantic co-ordination in the isolated dyads than within the group. As Garrod and Doherty (1994) concur, this implies that variation, i.e. differences in interlocutors&apos; representations is important for establishing and sustaining semantic co-ordination. 5 Granularity of analysis If variation of description types is intrinsic to the development of semantic co-ordination, this strongly suggests the importance of mechanisms involved in dealing with problematic understanding (Healey, forthcoming). All things being equal, variation increases the likelihood that interlocutors will encounter others whose use of language will differ more from their own.

To the extent that it relies on priming as its basic mechanism the IM cannot provide an account of how once a convention is established and used successfully, it might be supplanted by 47 another.. However, it is consistently observed that the description types used most frequently initially fall into disuse and are not converged on in later games.

It is not the case that interlocutors introduce their utterances carefully, and once they are sufficiently coordinated, move on.

However, there is evidence that it is only where they can go through the process of detecting and responding to differences in usage, i.e. repair, that co-ordination develops (Healey and Mills, 2006). If the boundary between description types and also the boundary between successful and unsuccessful use can be as porous as demonstrated in the excerpts above, this also suggests a more complex picture of referential contraction (Krauss and Weinheimer, 1966) than provided by current models of dialogue.

We argue that alignment is key to these patterns of modification, as it provides a backdrop against which changes can be made. The canonical example of this is embedded correction (Jefferson, 1983; Saxton, 2007) which exploits the structure provided by alignment to make a figure / ground distinction that allows the corrected element to be identified: 49 (1) A: You need to go to the top of the 5th row (2) B: I can&apos;t get to the top of the 5th line Excerpt 2: Substitution of problematic elements . Embedded corrections in the maze task exhibit very high levels of between-speaker alignment, yet occur at points in the dialogue where there is problematic understanding. This indicates that alignment can not simply be reduced to an index of successful communication. While this particular conver</context>

Although existing approaches to dialogue agree that answering this question necessarily involves focusing on the interactional devices available to interlocutors, their primary emphasis is on the information-exchange aspects of language use. Larsson (2007) provides a useful distinction between the co-ordination of information, i.e. establishing common ground (Clark, 1996) and the co-ordination of linguistic resources which are adapted to suit particular communicative situations in order to make such information-exchange possible. Part of this framework involves interlocutors negotiating which particular semantic model to use, and adapting their own interpretations on the basis of successful/unsuccesful use. However, although this framework sketches out a formal account of the mechanisms involved in this process, it is not concerned with predict</context>

While Larsson&apos;s account highlights the sheer flexibility of ways in which linguistic resources are mobilized and adapted to particular interaction settings, the data from the maze task suggest an additional level of complexity. Namely that the semantic resources can not be treated as separate, essentially equal encyclopaedias that interlocutors draw on. One way in which the cumulative shift toward Matrix descriptions is achieved is by the combination of different “registers” (Larsson 2007) to form a super-ordinate one. Here the question concerns which specific features of each semantic model are included in the final one, in particular when there are problems of commensurability. For example, as table 1 shows, a common pattern in maze task dialogues is that approximately half-way through the dialogues participants use “Line” descriptions. It can occur that they alternate between describing the maze as consisting of vertical and horizontal vectors, say with one participant favouring horizontal and the other favouring vertical vectors (space considerations preclude a throrough ex</context>

Evidence from the maze task suggests this boundary is one of the important locii in the development of semantic co-ordination. 9 Semantic plasticity To describe how interlocutors dynamically adapt the meanings of the words they use to the communicative situation and how they are shaped throughout the course of the dialogue, Larsson (2006) introduces the notion of “semantic plastici51 ty”. This model is sensitive to the fact that descriptions can involve a plethora of different “ad-hoc registers”, which resonates strongly with the empirical phenomena described here. However, the data from all the maze task experiments presents a further problem for attempts to model these phenomena, as successful co-ordination on the more specific abstract levels appears to be predicated upon prior successful use of less specific Figural descriptions: the Figural descriptions are highly specific to individual mazes and allow participants to co-</context>

This is further re-inforced by “percolation” occurring between levels, thus lexemes associated with particular semantic models will reinforce the use of these models. The claims associated with the interactive alignment model (henceforth IM) are drawn from a series of maze task experiments (Garrod &amp; Doherty 1994; Garrod and Anderson, 1987; Anderson and Garrod, 1987). This paper discusses some of the original findings of these experiments and a further set of maze task experiments conducted by Healey and Mills (2006), Mills and Healey (2006). These papers argued that the primary mechanisms provided by the IM are insufficient for explaining observed patterns in maze task dialogue; in particular how semantic co-ordination is achieved. The present paper argues that interlocutors in the Maze task exploit variation in usage in the service of semantic co-ordination. Furthermore we argue this suggests mechanisms which are relevant for a general account of how semantic co-ordination is achieved in dialogue. As the claims developed here are based on the maze task, we first explain the task in more detail. We then discuss a series of examp</context>

Further, any account of misunderstandings must also be able to address semantic differences between descriptions: participants in the maze task do not treat these four description types equally, and consequently are not appropriately modelled as co-ordination equilibria of the kind described by Lewis (1968) (Healey, 2004; forthcoming). Existing experimental data shows that participants systematically favour Figural and Path descriptions when encountering problematic dialogue (Mills and Healey, 2006; Healey, 1997) not the prior most frequently used semantic model as predicted by the IM. Looking more closely at the dialogues, it is not clear that the co-ordination mechanisms actually operate directly at the level of the four basic semantic models. Consider the following excerpt in which a participant encounters difficulties with a Line description type and its associated counting conventions. The dialogue continues with more Figural descriptions, before resuming at turn (35) with a Line description: 48 (1) A: go to the 1st row 2nd on the right (2) B: 2nd?

This is a counter-example to Clark and Marshall&apos;s (1981) model of definite reference repair, which states that to be effective “repair must add or alter descriptors, but not delete them”. Importantly, these CR responses that simply delete elements from the target turn are not treated by participants as repeats and queried again, but appear to promote resolution of the problematic understanding by engendering the use of more Figural descriptions. The words which are omitted do not appear, as with the level of description types, to be dictated by prior frequency of use (Mills, 2007). Instead, the data suggest that this pattern is motivated by a relaxation of the constraints of successful interpretation (Healey and Mills, 2006). The example above raises a further question concerning the relationship between semantic coordination and the exchange of information. In existing “ladder models” of communication such as the collaborative model of Clark (1996) and Allwood (1995), there is the general expectation that on encountering and signalling problematic understanding, interlocutors enter a sub-dialogue to resolve the problem, which on completion proceeds at the same “level”</context>

Findings from the maze task experiments augment this approach as they suggest that evidence of appropriateness is also derived in the absence of overt repair from semantic change alone. The excerpts indicate that interlocutors are sensitive to which particular tacit shift in model leads to a relaxation of the constraints on successful communication, and consequently can be exploited to indicate problematic understanding (Mills, 2007). For example, consider the following two excerpts: (1) A: It&apos;s on the 5th row 4th square (2) B: Huh? (3) A: The last square (1) A: It&apos;s on the 5th row 4th square (2) A: The last square Excerpts 4, 5: Provision of feedback If the dialogue continues successfully in both these instances, it is unclear how to adequately capture the differences between them, in particular, how both patterns affect subsequent use of the description types, One of the main challenges facing an account of semantic co-ordination is teasing apart how interlocutors&apos; models are affected by both semantic change exploited a</context>

It frequently occurs that Matrix descriptions emerge when these two different Line models are combined to form a Matrix description. This process, however, is not as a rule simply a matter of combining the two. Frequently, the two types of Line description employ different counting conventions, as in the example of the concierge above, giving rise to the problem of whether to retain different counting conventions for the different axes, or employ the same one. The question then emerges as to how this super-ordinate, more abstract semantic model affects the original models. Results from the m</context>

However, both engender similar semantic shifts towards Figural descriptions and result in a return to the originally problematic Line description. This leads to the immediate question of what motivates interlocutors&apos; patterns of alignment and modification, and how they reflect differences of understanding and diagnosis of the problem. The tacit and fine-grained nature of these modifications exacerbates the problem of arriving at a preliminary taxonomy, as these dialogue sequences are not readily categorizable as either “elaborations” or “reformulations” (cf. Purver et al., 2004, Schlangen 2004). 8 Boundary of (mis)communication During the course of maze task dialogues, participants shift seamlessly and tacitly from one description type to another. This occurs both within problematic and unproblematic dialogue. From an informational perspective, miscommunication is readily describable as a form of mismatch, yet from a semantic perspective, participants match each other more when encountering difficulties. 50 Thus alignment cannot be taken as a straightforward index of successful interaction.

A model of dialogue which attempts to address this issue is the interactive alignment model of Pickering and Garrod (2004). In this model convergence on a semantic model is arrived at via tacit priming occurring at all levels of representation (phonetic, phonological, lexical, syntactic, semantic and situational): interlocutors are more likely to re-use the representations used by their partner, giving rise to a “winner-takes-all” dynamic (cf.
