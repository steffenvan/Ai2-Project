Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999801916666667">
This work proposes a case-based classifier to tackle
the gene/protein mention problem in biomedical lit-
erature. The so called gene mention problem con-
sists of the recognition of gene and protein entities in
scientific texts. A classification process aiming at
deciding if a term is a gene mention or not is carried
out for each word in the text. It is based on the selec-
tion of the best or most similar case in a base of
known and unknown cases. The approach was
evaluated on several datasets for different organisms
and results show the suitability of this approach for
the gene mention problem.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999934636363636">
This paper proposes a new method to the gene
mention problem by using a case-based reasoning
approach that performs a binary classification
(gene mention or not) for each word in a text. In a
first step cases are stored in two bases (known and
unknown cases), followed by a search in these
bases for the case most similar to the problem. The
classification decision is given by the class of the
case selected. The system was developed using
Java and MySQL technologies and is available for
download as part of the Moara project1.

into two possible classes: gene mention or not. The
system consists of two main steps: the construction
of the case bases, and the testing phase, when the
test dataset is presented to the system to identify
the possible mentions. The words extracted from
the training documents were the tokens used to
construct the two case bases, one for known cases
and the other for unknown cases, as proposed for
the part-of-speech tagging problem in (Daelemans,
Zavrel, Berck, &amp; Gillis, 1996).
The known cases are the ones used by the sys-
tem to classify those words that are not new, i.e.
those that have were present in the training dataset.
The attributes used to represent a known case are
the word itself, the class of the word (if it is a gene
mention or not), and the class of the preceding
word (if it is a gene mention or not).
The system uses a second case base to decide
about words that are unknown to the system, i.e.
those that are not present in the training set. The
attributes of the unknown cases were the shape of
the word, the class of the word (if it is a gene men-
tion or not), and the class of the preceding word (if
it is a gene mention or not). Note that instead of
saving the word itself, a shape of the word is kept
in order to allow the system to be able to classify
unknown words by means of looking for cases
with similar shape. The shape of the word is given
by its transformation in a set of symbols according
to the type of character found.
In the construction of cases, each word repre-
sents a single case, and in order to account for
repetitions, the frequency of the case is incre-
mented to indicate the number of times that it ap-
pears in the training dataset. The training

documents are read twice, one in the forward (from
left to right), and one in the backward (from right
to left) directions, in order to allow a more variety
of cases. This is important as the classification of
a token may be influenced by its preceding and
following words.
CBR-Tagger has also been trained with addi-
tional corpora in order to better extract mentions
from different organisms. These extra corpora are
the datasets for gene normalization of the BioCrea-
tive task 1B (Hirschman, Colosimo, Morgan, &amp;
Yeh, 2005) for to yeast, mouse and fly and the
BioCreative 2 Gene Normalization task (Morgan &amp;
Hirschman, 2007) for human.
In the classification procedure, the text is token-
ized and a sliding window is applied first in the
forward and then in the backward direction. In
each case, the system keeps track of the class of
the preceding token (false at the beginning), gets
the shape of the token and tries to find in the bases
a case most similar to it. The search procedure is
divided in two parts, for the known and unknown
cases. Priority is always given to the known cases
since it saves the word exactly as they appeared in
the training documents and the classification may
be more precise than using the unknown cases.
A token already classified as positive by the
forward reading may be used for the backward
reading as preceding class and might help recog-
nizing mentions composed by many tokens that
would not have been totally recognized by one of
the reading procedures only. After the identifica-
tion of the best case for each token, some post-
processing procedures are executed to check
boundaries (for mentions composed of more than
one token) as well as abbreviations and corre-
sponding full names.
