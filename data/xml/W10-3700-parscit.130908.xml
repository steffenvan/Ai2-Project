The COLING 2010 Workshop on Multiword Expressions: from Theory to Applications (MWE 2010)
took place on August 28, 2010 in Beijing, China, following the 23rd International Conference on
Computational Linguistics (COLING 2010). The workshop has been held every year since 2003 in
conjunction with ACL, EACL and LREC; this is the first time that it has been co-located with COLING.
Multiword Expressions (MWEs) are a ubiquitous component of natural languages and appear steadily
on a daily basis, both in specialized and in general-purpose communication. While easily mastered by
native speakers, their interpretation poses a major challenge for automated analysis due to their flexible
and heterogeneous nature. Therefore, the automated processing of MWEs is desirable for any natural
language application that involves some degree of semantic interpretation, e.g., Machine Translation,
Information Extraction, and Question Answering.
In spite of the recent advances in the field, there is a wide range of open problems that prevent MWE
treatment techniques from full integration in current NLP systems. In MWE’2010, we were interested in
major challenges in the overall process of MWE treatment. We thus asked for original research related
but not limited to the following topics:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.968133">
• MWE resources: Although underused in most current state-of-the-art approaches, resources are
key for developing real-world applications capable of interpreting MWEs. We thus encouraged
submissions describing the process of building MWE resources, constructed both manually and
automatically from text corpora; we were also interested in assessing the usability of such
resources in various MWE tasks.
• Hybrid approaches: We further invited research on integrating heterogeneous MWE treatment
techniques and resources in NLP applications. Such hybrid approaches can aim, for example, at
the combination of results from symbolic and statistical approaches, at the fusion of manually built
and automatically extracted resources, or at the design of language learning techniques.
• Domain adaptation: Real-world NLP applications need to be robust to deal with texts coming
from different domains. Thus, its is important to assess the performance of MWE methods across
domains or describing domain adaptation techniques for MWEs.
• Multilingualism: Parallel and comparable corpora are gaining popularity as a resource for
automatic MWE discovery and treatment. We were thus interested in the integration of MWE
processing in multilingual applications such as machine translation and multilingual information
retrieval, as well as in porting existing monolingual MWE approaches to new languages.

<bodyText confidence="0.999944142857143">
We received 18 submissions, and, given our limited capacity as a one-day workshop, we were only able to
accept eight full papers for oral presentation: an acceptance rate of 44%. We further accepted four papers
as posters. The regular papers were distributed in three sessions: Lexical Representation, Identification
and Extraction, and Applications. The workshop also featured two invited talks, by Kyo Kageura and by
Aravind K. Joshi, and a panel discussion.
We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for their timely reviews. We would also
like to thank the authors for their valuable contributions.
