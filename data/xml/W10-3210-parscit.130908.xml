We present a strategy for revealing
event schema in Chinese based on the
manual annotation of texts. The overall
event information is divided into three
levels and events are chosen as the ele-
mentary units in annotation. Event-level
annotation content and the obtaining of
events patterns are explored in detail.
The discourse-level annotation, annota-
tion of relations between events and an-
notation of the functional attributes pro-
vide a simple way to represent event
schema.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999145">
When we want to understand a report on occur-
rences, we need to catch the following informa-
tion: the categorization of events, the relation-
ships between them, the participants and the
attributes of the events such as polarity and
modality, the attitudes towards the events and
the following actions or consequences. Only the
information above cannot be the precisely de-
scried. Furthermore, we need to form a schema
which incorporates all of the above, that is, to
compile all this information together to get the
integral structure about the report.
The available annotated corpora concerning
the different types of information mentioned
above include: the event-annotated corpora such
as ACE corpora, the corpora annotating tempor-
al information such as TimeBank, the corpora
annotating event factuality such as FactBank,
the corpora annotating various types of dis-
course relations such as RST corpus and Penn
Discourse TreeBank. Meanwhile, we lack the
annotation of event schema, which is important
for providing the integral meaning of the reports.
Currently for Chinese language, the annota-
tion of event information corpora is just begin-
ning and still far from being sufficient, when
compared with English, hence it needs further
exploration.

The work and theories concerning event schema
annotation can be divided into three categories.
The first kind is focused on annotation of the
event argument structure, such as in ACE. The
second kind is focused on annotation of the
temporal information and event factuality. The
last is focused on the annotation of the relations
among different discourse units such as RST
corpus and Penn Discourse TreeBank.
ACE(2005) is an in-depth study of research
oriented annotated corpus for the purpose of
textual information extraction. The annotation
task includes event annotation besides the anno-
tation of entities, values and relations between
entities. The event annotation is limited to cer-
tain types and subtypes of events, that is, Life,
Movement, Transaction, Business, Conflict,
Contact, Personnel, and Justice. The argument
structure of events including participants and
other components such as time and place are
predefined and tagged. Besides these, four kinds
of attributes of events, polarity, tense, genericity
and modality, are tagged. The expression cha-
racters of events, including the extent and the
triggers, are also tagged.
TimeML(Pustejovsky et al., 2003; TimeML,
2005) is a system for representing not only all
events but also temporal information. The
events tagged are not limited to certain types as
in ACE, but are classified in a different way.

guished and tagged respectively. For each event
instance, four kinds of attributes, namely, tense,
aspect, polarity and modality are tagged.
TimeML defines three kinds of links between
events and times. TLINK represents temporal
relationships, including simultaneous, before
and after. SLINK represents subordinative rela-
tionships. And ALINK represents relationships
between an aspectual event and its argument
event. Several TimeML corpora have been
created now, including TimeBank and

FactBank(Roser and Pustejovsky, 2008, 2009;
Roser, 2008) is a corpus that adds factuality in-
formation to TimeBank. The factual value of
events under certain sources is represented by
two kinds of attributes, modality and polarity.
Besides the annotation of events and their
temporal relationships or factuality information,
there are various types of discourse annotation,
which can be divided into two trends: one under
the guidance of a certain discourse theory(such
as RST) and the one independent of any specific
theory(such as PDTB).
RST (Mann and Thompson, 1987; Taboada
and Mann, 2006) was originally developed as
part of studies on computer-based text genera-
tion by William Mann and Sandra Thompson in
1980s. In the RST framework, the discourse
structure of a text can be represented as a tree.
The leaves of the tree correspond to text frag-
ments that represent the minimal units of the
discourse; the internal nodes of the tree corres-
pond to contiguous text spans; each node is cha-
racterized by its nuclearity and by a rhetorical
relation that holds between two or more non-
overlapping, adjacent text spans. RST chooses
the clause as the elementary unit of discourse.
All units are also spans, and spans may be com-
posed of more than one unit. RST relations are
defined in terms of four fields: (1) Constraints
on the nucleus; (2) Constraints on the satellite;
(3) Constraints on the combination of the nuc-
leus and the satellite; and (4) Effects. The num-
ber and the types of relations are not fixed. It
can be reduced or extended. Carlson et al. (2003)
describes the experience of developing a dis-
course-annotated corpus grounded in the
framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory. The
resulting corpus contains 385 documents se-
lected from the Penn Treebank.
Penn Discourse TreeBank(Miltsakaki et al.,
2004; Webber et al., 2005) is to annotate the
million-word WSJ corpus in the Penn TreeBank
with a layer of discourse information. Although
the idea of annotating connectives and their ar-
guments comes from the theoretical work on
discourse connectives in the framework of lexi-
calized grammar, the corpus itself is not tied to
any particular theory. Discourse connectives
were treated as discourse-level predicates of
binary discourse relations that take two abstract
objects such as events, states, and propositions.
The two arguments to a discourse connective
were simply labeled Arg1 and Arg2.

3.1 The Elementary Unit of Event Schema
Annotation

<bodyText confidence="0.999849909090909">
What counts as an elementary unit of Event
Schema annotation in Chinese?
It is common to set sentences or clause as the
basic units in discourse annotation such as RST
corpus. However, there will be certain limita-
tions if we choose sentences or clauses as the
elementary units of Chinese event schema anno-
tation:
First, a Chinese sentence is generally defined
as a grammatical unit that has pauses before and
after it, a certain intonation, and expresses a
complete idea. But the definition is not exact or
operational. The only notable borders of Chi-
nese sentences in writings are the punctuations
at the end of the sentences. The same is true of
clauses in Chinese.
Second, there is generally more than one
event in a sentence or a clause in Chinese.
Hence, if we choose sentences or clauses as the
basic units of event schema annotation, the rela-
tions between the events in one sentence/clause
cannot be described in detail. For example:

In example 1, there are two events in bold
type: the fire and the death in one sentence. In
example 2, there are also two events in a single
sentence: the earthquake and the declaration.
The “event” in this paper covers the same
meaning defined by ACE(2005), which refers to
&amp;quot;a specific occurrence involving participants&amp;quot;.
Zou and Yang(2007) shows that an average
of 2.3 times events per sentence are reported in
Chinese texts and hence chose events as the ba-
sic discourse unit in their annotation. This con-
sideration also fits the elementary unit of event
schema annotation.

3.2 Three Levels of Event Schema Annota-
tion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990790697674">
The overall event information in a report is
complex and consists of different levels. In or-
der to simplify the annotation task, we first di-
vide the total event information into three levels,
that is, the discourse level, the event level, and
the entity level, choosing the event as the ele-
mentary unit of the event schema annotation.
The event level is defined as the level relat-
ing to atomic events. A report of occurrences
always has many related events that are very
easy to recognize. The events are atomic, which
means the events are divided into small and mi-
nimal events. For example, when reading a re-
port about an earthquake that happened in Haiti,
the reader will not only know about the earth-
quake itself, but also other relating happenings
such as the number of casualty or the following
search and rescue. These things are divided into
different atomic events, though they are still
linked closely.
The entity level means the entities, times,
and locations that are involved in events. For
example, in “China rescues 11S from a flooded
mine”, “China” is the agent of the rescue;
“11S(miners)” are the recipients; “a flooded
mine” is the location. These three entities are
the arguments of the rescue event and should be
annotated before tagging them as the arguments
of the rescue event.
The discourse level is the level above the
event level which creates the integral meaning
of the event schema. For example, the report
concerning the rescue of miners from a flooded
mine involves the rescue, the coalmine accident
and possibly injuries. These events are linked
together but have different significances within
the report. So it is necessary to annotate the dif-
ferent significances of the events, as well as re-
lations between events.
The following passages discuss in detail the
event-level and the discourse-level annotation,
while the entity-level annotation will not be dis-
cussed considering its relative simplicity.

4.1 Definition of Events
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999562375">
ACE(2005) defines an event as follows: An
event is a specific occurrence involving partici-
pants. An event is something that happens. An
event can frequently be described as a change of
state. According to ACE’s definition, we define
event as the following: An Event is an occur-
rence that catches somebody&apos;s attention and a
change of state.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999043">
4.2 Obtainment of Event Patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99603335">
The event patterns are the argument structures
of certain types of events, which are the direc-
tors of argument annotation. They are extracted
from large-scale texts category by category. The
above categories are based on the classification
of sudden events. In other words, sudden events
are divided into 4 categories: natural disasters,
accidental disasters, public health incidents,
and social security incidents, and each category
includes different types of events, for example,
the natural disasters includes earthquakes, tsu-
namis, debris flows and so on. In dealing with a
specific kind of texts, only the closely related
events that appear frequently are annotated. For
example, when annotating the events of earth-
quake, only earthquake itself and closely related
events such as loss, rescue, etc, are annotated.
The event patterns are manually extracted
from real texts as follows, taking earthquake for
instance:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99366775">
• A search engine is used to obtain the reports
whose titles and main bodies contain the key
word ‘earthquake’, and then manually filter out
those texts whose topics are not;
• The remaining texts are then split into sen-
tences and only the sentences that narrate an
earthquake or are closely relate to the earth-
quake are selected;
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.750819">
74
</page>
<listItem confidence="0.9472242">
• Specific entities in these sentences are re-
placed with general tags such as ‘&lt;TIME&gt;’,
‘&lt;PER&gt;’ and ‘&lt;LOC&gt;’ to get the patterns for
earthquake type events;
• Frequently used patterns for earthquake
events are extracted from the descriptions;
• The arguments of the event are numbered in
sequence, and given corresponding explanations;
• The arguments are appended to event pat-
terns when new roles are found.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9848685">
The following principles should be abided by
when extracting event patterns:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988812909090909">
• Event triggers are the words or expressions
that indicate existence of an event or events. If
there is an event trigger in a sentence, we con-
sider that there exists a corresponding event;
• Event triggers of different categories indi-
cate different kinds of events;
• Some arguments of an event can be indis-
tinct in a sentence. In other words, the different
roles of the same event need to be merged into
different patterns to get the complete argument
structure of a certain event.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989721">
Some arguments are common roles in many
events, such as time, location, and some argu-
ments are specific to some events, such as the
magnitude, and the focus of an earthquake. Af-
ter the extraction of a certain amount of patterns,
we can then merge the similar events. So far, we
have obtained 31 categories of event patterns
for 4 topics of news events.
Here is the event pattern corresponding to the
earthquake event type extracted:

4.3 Annotation of Types and Arguments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977421052632">
After obtaining the event patterns, we can anno-
tate the types and the arguments of events ac-
cording to the predefined types and patterns. If a
certain event is not yet defined, the annotator
should tag the event as “Other” and retag it later
after obtaining the pattern of that category pro-
vided that the category is not too rare in similar
reports.
The annotation of arguments consists of two
steps. Firstly, we locate the entities and other
expressions that belong to the arguments of a
certain event. Then, we locate the roles of fixed
arguments according to the corresponding event
pattern. The arguments of an event are sought in
the scope of the sentence in which the event
trigger appears.
For example, according to the earthquake
event pattern listed before, the annotation of the
following sentence would be as follows:

4.4 Annotation of Event Attributes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999233333333333">
Besides the types and arguments, the attributes
of events are also tagged, which is necessary for
a comprehensive description of events. Based
on the analysis of various attributes in the re-
ports, we decided to annotate the following:
Polarity, Modality, Tense, Aspect, Level, Fre-
quency, Source, and Fulfillment. Among these
attributes, Polarity, Modality and Tense are
adopted by both ACE and TimeML. Aspect,
Frequency and Source are adopted by TimeML.
The primary reason for annotating these
attributes is that they have an important role in
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994482">
75
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.979126929577465">
describing events in detail and different values
of some attributes can even imply a totally dif-
ferent meaning.
Polarity is whether the event happened or
would happen. The value of polarity can only be
one between “Positive” and “Negative”. For
example, in
“所幸这起火灾没有造成人员伤亡” (Fortu-
nately the fires did not result in any casualties)
the polarity of event “ 伤 亡 ”(injuries-or-
deaths) is “negative”.
Modality is the possibility of the event. Cur-
rently, we divide modality simply into “As-
serted” and “Other”. For example, in
“震区许多居民担心再次发生海啸” (Many
residents in earthquake-hit areas worry about a
recurrence of the tsunami)
the modality of event “海 啸 ”(tsunami) is
“Other”.
Tense is the time the event happened com-
pared with the time of the report. It can be
“Past”, “Present”, “Future”, or “Underspeci-
fied”. For example, in
“警方目前正在进行调查”(A Police investiga-
tion is under way)
the tense of event “调查” (investigation) is
“Present”.
Aspect is whether or not the event is continu-
ing or completed. It can be “Progressive”, “Per-
fective” or “Underspecified”. In the sentence
above, the aspect of event “调查” (investigation)
is “Progressive”.
Level is the extent of the events. It can be
“Serious”, “Medium” or “Slight”. If the annota-
tor cannot make sure, it can also be ignored. For
example, in
“强烈地震袭击印尼” (Strong earthquake hits
Indonesian)
the level of the event “地震” (earthquake) is
“Serious”.
Frequency is how many times the event hap-
pened. Usually it is only once, yet sometimes,
as mentioned above, it may be twice or more.
Source consists of the source of the informa-
tion about a certain event and the time the in-
formation issued. If not specialized, the source
is equal to the source of the report itself and the
time of source is equal to the time that the report
was issued. For example, in
“巴黎警方 10 日透露” (according to state-
ments by the Paris police on 10th)
the source is “巴黎警方”(the Paris police)
and the time issued is “10 日”(the 10th).
Fulfillment is an interesting attribute of
events that deserves further study and will be
discussed in another paper. This is an attribute
which is only applicable to man-made events
with an emphasized intention, in other words, it
is not applicable to those events occurring natu-
rally. It can be “Fulfilled”, “Unfulfilled”, or
“Underspecified”. For example, a rescue event
is deliberate and has or will have a result. For
example, in
“中国成功救出被困 8 昼夜的 115 名矿工”
(China rescues 115 from flooded mine after 8
days)
the fulfillment of the event “救”(rescue) is
“Fulfilled”.
The complete attributes of an event can be
represented as a complex feature set as shown
below:

The recognition of types, arguments and

sense of the annotator, but also depends on lin-
guistic indicators within the text. To locate the

called a

which clearly indicates something that has hap-
pened. In the following sentence,

causing huge property damage.)
The Event Words “ 火 灾 ”(fire), “ 死
亡 ”(killing), “ 重 伤 ”(injuring) and “ 损
失 ”(damage) in the sentence above indicate
four events respectively.
Besides annotating Event Words for events,
the annotator also needs annotating indicators
from texts to help to locate the attributes of the
events. The attributes annotated should be clear-
ly indicated by some linguistic hints, so the val-
ue of a certain attribute will not be specified if
the hints are not so clear.

5 Discourse-level Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878857142857">
The purpose of discourse level annotation is to
integrate the information from the event-level
into a structure. We annotate two kinds of dis-
course information, the relationships among
events as annotated before and the functional
attributes of events, to represent the event
schema.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99979">
5.1 Annotation of Relations among Events
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960388138888889">
The events in the same report are not self-
sufficient or independent, but are linked by var-
ious relationships, such as the causal relation-
ships between an earthquake and an injury.
Taking into account of both the frequency of
relationships between events and the ease and
accuracy of distinguishing them, we have de-
cided to focus on the following: causality, co-
reference, sequential, purpose, part-whole, jux-
taposition and contrast.
Causality is very common in reports. If event
A is responsible for the happening of event B,
then there exists a causal relationship between
A and B. For example, in
“海地首都太子港附近发生里氏 7.0 级强烈
地震,造成一家医院倒塌,另有多座政府建
筑损毁。” (A magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit
Haiti, causing a hospital to collapse and da-
maging government buildings in the capital city
of Port-au-Prince.)
there are three events, called “ 地
震”(earthquake), “倒塌”(collapsing) and “损
毁”(damaging), and a causal relationship be-
tween “地震” and “倒塌” /“损毁”.
Co-reference is not the relationship between
two different events but the relationship be-
tween two expressions of events that refer to the
same object.
Sequential is the relation between A and B
such that B follows A chronologically but there
is not necessarily a causal relationship between
them. For example, in
“尼日利亚南部经济中心拉各斯一名22 岁
妇女 1 月 17 日因病死亡,后经尼卫生部门检
测,该妇女死于高致病性禽流感。” (A 22-
year-old woman died of illness on Jan. 17 in
Lagos, Nigeria&apos;s southern economic hub. After
being tested by the Nigerian health sector, it
was found that the woman had died of bird flu.)
the events “死亡”(death) and “检测”(testing)
have sequential relationship.
Purpose is the relation between A and B that
A happened for B. For example, in
“尼日利亚政府目前已经在全国范围内加大
了卫生监管力度,以控制高致病性禽流感的
扩散。” (The Nigerian government has already
strengthened hygienic supervision and regula-
tion nationwide to control the spread of the
highly pathogenic avian influenza.)
the purpose of the event “监管”(supervision)
is to “控制”(control).
Part-whole relationship between A and B is
when B is part of A. For example, in
“台风“桑美”给福鼎市带来重大人员伤
亡,截至目前已有 138 人死亡,其中海上遇
难人员 116 人,陆上遇难人员 22 人,还有
86 人失踪。” (Saomai caused significant ca-
sualties in Fuding: at least 138 people have
been killed so far, including 116 at sea, and 22
were on land, with 86 missing.)
the event “遇难” (killed) appeared first and
is part of the event “伤亡” (casualties).
Juxtaposition relationship means that A and
B are caused by the same thing, or that A and B
are simultaneous. For example, in
“大同市、左云县有关部门已对被困矿工
家属进行了妥善安置。同时,环境部门正在
对水质进行监测。” (Datong, Zuoyun authori-
ties have made proper arrangements for the
families of trapped miners. Meanwhile, the de-
partment for environmental protection has been
monitoring water quality.)

toring) are simultaneous.
Contrast relationship is when A would
usually cause B, but here A happened and didn’t
in fact cause B. For example, in
“萨尔瓦多中部地区 2 日发生里氏 5.3 级
地震,但没有造成人员伤亡和财产损失 。”
(A 5.3 magnitude earthquake hit the central re-
gion of Salvador on the 2nd, but caused no ca-
sualties or property losses.)
the “地震”(earthquake) usually causes “伤
亡”(casualties), but here there is no “伤亡”.
The contrast relationship between A and B is
not equal to the negation of a causal relationship,
because in a contrast relationship A is positive
and B is negative, while in the negation of caus-
al relationship, the A is negative.
Besides those relationships between events
described above, the annotator could tag the
relation as “Underspecified” if he/she feels that
relationship belongs to a new kind and deserves
to be annotated.
These relations are also annotated with the
attributes similar to those of events, but only
including Polarity, Modality, Tense, Aspect
and Source.

5.2 Annotation of Functional Attributes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938517241379">
The annotation of relations among events only
represents the local discourse structure of the
report. To represent the overall information it is
necessary to integrate the event-level informa-
tion globally. We find that the events annotated
in one text are not owning equal significance,
and they can be divided into at least two basic
kinds according to their role in expressing the
highlight of the text. The two basic kinds of role
we decide to tag are “core” and “related”. We
call this the functional attribute of the events.
The core events are the events that are the
topics of the reports. Other events are the re-
lated events. If core events were removed, the
elementary topics would change and the remain-
ing events could not easily be organized togeth-
er well. For example, in a report concerning the
earthquake that happened in Haiti several
months ago, the report’s core events are the
events representing the earthquake. The other
events such as the rescue or the injuries are not
integral and cannot be meaningful alone. But if
the other events were removed, the topic and
logic of the report would still be clear, though
the details might be somewhat incomplete.
After annotating the relationships among
events and functional attributes of these events,
we can represent a report about an earthquake
which happened in Kyrgyzstan as follow:

6 Preliminary Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996788789473684">
In order to check the taggability of the annota-
tion strategy mentioned above, three graduate
students manually annotated about 60 news re-
ports in 3 categories, including earthquake, fire
and attack, using sina search engine, according
to the method and principles above. Each text
was annotated by two annotators and discussed
jointly if the annotation results were inconsis-
tent or not proper.
As can be seen from Table 3 below, 1) the
event patterns extracted can cover the texts well
because up to 78% sentences have been anno-
tated. 2) There are 1.6 times more annotated
events than annotated sentences. This shows
that there is generally more than one event in a
sentence. So, it is reasonable to assume that the
annotation method can accomplish the task of a
detailed description of relationships between
events. 3) The relevant events are more numer-

We have also analyzed the event attributes in
detail(Zou and Yang, 2010). An interesting
event attribute is Fulfillment, which is only ap-
plicable to those events with intentions whose
result is often emphasized. Sometimes, readers
care about the intended results or outcomes as
much as or more than the events themselves.
Therefore it would be useful to explore the no-
tion of Fulfillment, and investigate which lin-
guistic categories could play a role in deciding
the value of Fulfillment. We plan to create a
Fulfillment corpus in the next stage.
The annotation of event schema is time-
consuming, partly because it needs to annotate
all three levels of event information of every
text, and partly because of the difficulties to
identify the event information from trivial de-
scriptions, in other words, one question we of-
ten discuss is whether it deserves to annotate
certain parts of a text. Also, we often need to
make a balance between obtaining enough event
patterns to cover various types of related events
well and omitting low frequent event types to
simply the obtainment of event patterns. In dis-
course-level annotation, the main difficulty is
the identification of relations between events
without lexical hints. This discourse-level anno-
tation is only just underway. We also plan to
give detailed analysis in the next stage.

An interesting event attribute is Fulfillment, which is only applicable to those events with intentions whose result is often emphasized. Sometimes, readers care about the intended results or outcomes as much as or more than the events themselves. Therefore it would be useful to explore the notion of Fulfillment, and investigate which linguistic categories could play a role in deciding the value of Fulfillment. We plan to create a Fulfillment corpus in the next stage. The annotation of event schema is timeconsuming, partly because it needs to annotate all three levels of event information of</context>
