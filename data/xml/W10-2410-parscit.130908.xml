This article describes the first trial on bidirec-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998837090909091">
Transliteration aims to phonetically transcribe
text in source languages with text in target lan-
guages. The task is crucial for various natural
language processing research and applications
such as machine translation, multilingual text-to-
speech synthesis and information retrieval. Most
of current Thai writings contain both Thai and
English scripts. Such English words when writ-
ten in Thai are mainly their translations. Without
official translation forms, transliterations often
take place.
Thai-English machine transliteration and re-
lated research have been investigated for many
years. Works for Thai word romanization or
Thai-to-English transliteration are such as Char-
oenporn et al. (1999), Aroonmanakun and
Rivepiboon (2004). Both works proposed statist-
ical romanization models based on the syllable
unit. Generating Thai scripts of English words
are mainly via automatic transcription of English
words. Aroonmanakun (2005) described a
chunk-based n-gram model where the chunk is a
group of characters useful for mapping to Thai
transcriptions. Thangthai et al. (2007) proposed a
method for generating Thai phonetic transcrip-
tions of English words for use in Thai/English
text-to-speech synthesis. The CART learning
machine was adopted to map English characters
to Thai phonetics. As our literature review, a
general algorithm for bi-directional Thai-to-Eng-
lish and English-to-Thai transliteration has not
been investigated.
The NEWS machine transliteration shared task
has just included Thai-English words as a part of
its corpus in 2010, serving as a good source for
algorithm benchmarking. In this article, a Thai-
English machine transliteration system is evalu-
ated on the NEWS 2010 corpus. The system was
developed under intuitive concepts that translit-
eration among Thai-English is mostly done on
the basis of sound mimicking of syllable units.
Therefore, the algorithm firstly segments the in-
put word in a source language into syllable-like
units and finding pronunciations of each unit.
The pronunciation in the form of phonetic scripts
is used to find possible transliteration forms giv-
en a syllable translation table. The best result is
determined by using syllable n-gram.
The next section describes more details of
Thai-English transliteration problems and the
Thai-English NEWS 2010 corpus. The detail of
proposed system is given in Section 3 and its
evaluation is reported in Section 4. Section 5 dis-
cusses on existing problems and possible solu-
tions.

2 Thai-English Transliteration
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993974">
As mentioned in the Introduction, the current
Thai writing often contains both Thai and Eng-
lish scripts especially for English words without
compact translations. Many times, translitera-
tions take place when only Thai scripts are
needed. This is not only restricted to names but
also some common words like “computer”,
“physics”, etc.
The Thai Royal Institute (http://www.roy-
in.go.th) is authorized to issue official guidelines
for Thai transcriptions of foreign words and also
romanization of Thai words, which are respect-
ively equivalent to English-to-Thai and Thai-to-
English transliteration. Romanization of Thai
words is based on sound transcription. Thai con-

sonant and vowel alphabets are defined to map to
roman alphabets. Similarly, English-to-Thai
transliteration is defined based on the phonetic
transcription of English words. However, in the
latter case, an English phoneme could be mapped
to multiple Thai alphabets. For example, the
sound /k/ could be mapped to either “n ”, “T ” ,
“Fi”, or “V”. Moreover, the guideline reserves for
transliterations generally used in the current writ-
ing and also transliterations appeared in the offi-
cial Royal Institute dictionaries, even such trans-
literations do not comply with the guideline.
Since the guidelines are quite flexible and it is
also common that lots of Thai people may not
strictly follow the guidelines, ones can see many
ways of transliteration in daily used text. To
solve this ambiguity, both the official guidelines
and statistics of usage must be incorporated in
the machine transliteration system.
The Thai-English part of NEWS 2010 corpus
developed by the National Electronics and Com-
puter Technology Center (NECTEC) composes
of word pairs collected mainly from 3 sources;
press from the Thai Royal Institute, press from
other sources, and the NEWS 2009 corpus. The
first two sources, sharing about 40% of the cor-
pus, mostly contain common English words of-
ten transliterated into Thai and the transliteration
is almost restricted to the Royal Institute
guidelines. The rest are English names selected
from the NEWS 2009 corpus based on their fre-
quencies found by the Google search. Such Eng-
lish names were transliterated into Thai and re-
checked by linguists using the Royal Institute
transliteration guideline.

3 Proposed Transliteration System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992833333333">
Our proposed model is similar to what proposed
by Jiang et al. (2009), which introduced transla-
tion among Chinese and English names based on
syllable units and determined the best candidate
using the statistical n-gram model. The overall
structure of our model is shown in Figure 1.

3.1 Syllabification and letter-to-sound
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9974815">
An input word in the source language is first seg-
mented into syllable-like units. It is noted that
there are some cases where segmented units are
not really a syllable. For examples, “S” in the
word “SPECTOR” might actually be pronounced
as a single consonant without vowel. The Thai
word “LAua”/s-a n-e:/ is unbreakable as the letter
expressed for the first syllable /s-a/ is enclosed in
the letters of the second syllable /n-e:/. These
cases are considered exceptional syllables.

In the Thai-to-English system, syllabification
of Thai words is a part of a Thai letter-to-sound
conversion tool provided by Thangthai et al.
(2006). It is performed using context-free gram-
mar (CFG) rules created by Tarsaku et al. (2001).
The CFG rules produce syllable-sequence hypo-
theses, which are then disambiguated by using
syllable n-gram. Simultaneously, the tool
provides the phonetic transcription of the best
syllable sequence by using a simple syllable-to-
phone mapping. Figure 1 shows an example of
an input Thai word “ALf1nLmal” which is segmen-
ted into 3 syllables “A|Lf1n|Lmal” and converted
to the phonetic transcription defined for Thai “s-
a|p-e-k|t-e:”.
In the English-to-Thai system, a simple syllab-
ification module of English words is created us-
ing the following rules.

<listItem confidence="0.9104054">
1) Marking all vowel letters “a, e, i, o, u”,
e.g. L[o]m[o]c[a]t[i]v[e], J[a]nsp[o]rt
2) Using some rules, merging consonantal
letters surrounding each vowel to form
basic syllables,
e.g. Lo|mo|ca|ti|ve, Jan|sport
3) Post-processing by merging the syllable
with “e” vowel into its preceding syllable
e.g. Lo|mo|ca|tive, and re-segmenting for
syllables without vowel letters, e.g.

actually be conducted by several public tools like

quirement as it could not output syllable bound-
aries of the phonetic sequence and finding such
boundaries is not trivial. Instead, a tool for con-
verting English words to Thai phonetic transcrip-
tions developed by Thangthai et al. (2007) is ad-
opted. In this tool, the CART learning machine is
used to capture the relationship among alphabets
and English phone transcriptions of English
words and Thai phone transcriptions. Since the
Thai phonetic transcription is defined based on
the syllable structure, the syllable boundaries of
phonetic transcriptions given by this tool can be
obtained.

3.2 Syllable transliteration and disambigu-
ation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985045">
In the training phase, both Thai and English
words in pairs are syllabified and converted to
phonetic transcriptions using the methods de-
scribed in the previous subsection. To reduce the
effect of errors caused by automatic syllabifica-
tion, only word pairs having equal number of
syllables are kept for building a syllable translit-
eration table. The table consists of a list of syl-
lable phonetic transcriptions and its possible tex-
tual syllables in both languages. An n-gram mod-
el of textual syllables in each language is also
prepared from the training set.
In the testing phase, each syllable in the
source-language word is mapped to possible syl-
lables in the target language via its phonetic tran-
scription using the syllable transliteration table
described above. Since each syllable could be
transliterated to multiple hypotheses, the best hy-
pothesis can be determined by considering syl-
lable n-gram probabilities.

4 Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999784962962963">
The Thai-English part of NEWS 2010 were de-
ployed in our experiment. The training set com-
poses of 24,501 word pairs and two test sets,
2,000 words for English-to-Thai and 1,994 words
for Thai-to-English are used for evaluation. All
training words were syllable segmented and con-
verted to phonetic transcriptions using the tools
described in the Section 3.1. Since the CFG rules
could not completely cover all possible syllables
in Thai, some words failed from automatically
generating phonetic transcriptions were filtered
out. As mentioned also in the Section 3.1, only
word pairs with equal number of segmented syl-
lables were kept for training. Finally, 16,705 out
of 24,501 word pairs were reserved for building
the syllable transliteration table and for training
syllable 2-gram models.
Table 1 shows some statistics of syllables col-
lected from the training word pairs. Since the
Thai-English word pairs provided in NEWS
2010 were prepared mainly by transliterating
English words and names into Thai, it is hence
reasonable that the number of distinct syllables
in Thai is considerably lower than in English.
Similarly, the other statistics like the numbers of
homophones per syllable phonetic-transcription
are in the same manner.

As seen from the Table 1 that there could be
up to 38 candidates of textual syllables given a
syllable phonetic transcription. To avoid the
large search space of syllable combinations, only
top-frequency syllables were included in the
search space. Table 2 shows transliteration res-
ults regarding 4 measures defined in the NEWS

to-Thai and Thai-to-English transliteration are
non-standard tests as external letter-to-sound

5 Analysis and Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.995972058823529">
There are still some problematic issues regarding
the transliteration format including hyphenation
and case sensitivity in the test data. Ignoring both
problems leads to 0.5% and 8.3% improvement
on the English-to-Thai and Thai-to-English tests
respectively. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution
of test words and error words with respect to the
word length in the unit of syllables. More than
80% of test words are either 2 or 3 syllables. It
can be roughly seen that the ratio of error words
over test words increases with respect to the
length of words. This is by the fact that the
whole word will be considered incorrect even if
only a syllable in the word is wrongly transliter-
ated. Out of 3,860 syllable units extracted from
all error words, over 57% are correctly transliter-
ated.

Another issue largely affecting the system per-
formance is as mentioned in the Section 2 that
the Thai Royal Institute&apos;s guideline is somewhat
flexible for multiple ways of transliteration.
However, the corpus used to train and test cur-
rently provides only one way of transliteration.
Improving the corpus to cope with such translit-
eration flexibility is needed. In developing the
Thai-English NEWS 2010 transliteration corpus,
some foreign names are difficult to pronounce
even by linguists. Errors in the corpus are then
unavoidable and required further improvement.
Many algorithms could be conducted to help
improve the system accuracy. First, the current
system uses only syllable n-gram probabilities to
determine the best result without considering
how likely the target syllable is close to the
source syllable. For example, the source syllables
“BIKE” and “BYTE” are transliterated to Thai as
“ไบค�”and “ไบท�” respectively. Both Thai translit-
erated syllables are pronounced in the same way
as /b-ai/. It can be seen that both syllables
“BIKE” and “BYTE” can be linked to both
“ไ บ ค ”and “ไ บ ท� ” . Selecting the best syllable
takes only the syllable n-gram into account
without considering its right transliteration. Dir-
ect mapping between source and target syllables
could solve this problem but leads to another
problem of unseen syllables. A better way is to
incorporate in the search space another score rep-
resenting the closeness of source and target syl-
lables. As the example, the syllable “BIKE” is
closer to “ไบค�” than to “ไบท�” as the letter “K” is
normally pronounced like “ค” /k/, not “ท” /th/.
We have tried incorporating such knowledge by
introducing a syllable similarity score in the
search space. Given a pair of source and target
syllables, the syllable similarity score is the num-
ber of consonants having the same sound like
“K” and “ค” divided by the total number of con-
sonants in the syllable. Unfortunately, this ap-
proach could not yield any improvement cur-
rently as many syllable pairs happened to have
the same similarity score. A better definition of
the score will be conducted in the future work.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977210526316">
The Thai-English part of NEWS 2010 translitera-
tion corpus was briefly described and its use in
building a Thai-English machine transliteration
system was reported. The system is based on
transliteration of syllable units extracted from the
whole input word. Within the space of candidate
transliterated syllables, the best output was de-
termined by using the statistical syllable n-gram
model. There are many issues left for further im-
provement. First, possible transliterations of each
word should be added to the corpus. Second, the
system itself could be improved by e.g. incorpor-
ating better syllabification approaches, defining a
better syllable similarity score, and comparing
with other potential algorithms. Finally, as the
Thai-to-English part of the transliteration corpus
is actually back-transliteration of English-to-
Thai, it is interesting to extend the corpus to cope
with real-use Thai-to-English word pairs.

The task is crucial for various natural language processing research and applications such as machine translation, multilingual text-tospeech synthesis and information retrieval. Most of current Thai writings contain both Thai and English scripts. Such English words when written in Thai are mainly their translations.

Works for Thai word romanization or Thai-to-English transliteration are such as Charoenporn et al. (1999), Aroonmanakun and Rivepiboon (2004).

Such English words when written in Thai are mainly their translations. Without official translation forms, transliterations often take place. Thai-English machine transliteration and related research have been investigated for many years. Works for Thai word romanization or Thai-to-English transliteration are such as Charoenporn et al. (1999), Aroonmanakun and Rivepiboon (2004). Both works proposed statistical romanization models based on the syllable unit. Generating Thai scripts of English words are mainly via automatic transcription of English words. Aroonmanakun (2005) described a chunk-based n-gram model where the chunk is a group of characters useful for mapping to Thai transcriptions. Thangthai et al. (2007) proposed a method for generating Thai phonetic transcriptions of English words for use in Thai/English text-to-speech synthesis. The CART learning machine was adopted to map English characters to Thai phonetics. As our literature review, a general algorithm for bi-directional Thai-to-English and English-to-Thai transliteration has not been investigated. The NEWS machine transliteration shared task has just included Thai-English words as a part of its</context>
