This paper describes research toward the automatic
interpretation of compound nouns using corpus
statistics. An initial study aimed at syntactic
disambiguation is presented. The approach presented
bases associations upon thesaurus categories.
Association data is gathered from unambiguous cases
extracted from a corpus and is then applied to the
analysis of ambiguous compound nouns. While the
work presented is still in progress, a first attempt to
syntactically analyse a test set of 244 examples shows
75% correctness. Future work is aimed at improving
this accuracy and extending the technique to assign
semantic role information, thus producing a complete

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998999734375">
Compound Nouns: Compound nouns (CNs) are a
commonly occurring construction in language
consisting of a sequence of nouns, acting as a noun;
pottery coffee mug, for example. For a detailed
linguistic theory of compound noun syntax and
semantics, see Levi (1978). Compound nouns are
analysed syntactically by means of the rule N --) N N
applied recursively. Compounds of more than two
nouns are ambiguous in syntactic structure. A
necessary part of producing an interpretation of a CN
is an analysis of the attachments within the compound.
Syntactic parsers cannot choose an appropriate
analysis, because attachments are not syntactically
governed. The current work presents a system for
automatically deriving a syntactic analysis of arbitrary
CNs in English using corpus statistics.
Task description: The initial task can be
formulated as choosing the most probable binary
bracketing for a given noun sequence, known to form a
compound noun, without knowledge of the context.
E.G.: (pottery (coffee mug)); ((coffee mug) holder)
Corpus Statistics: The need for wide
ranging lexical-semantic knowledge to support NLP,
commonly referred to as the ACQUISITION PROBLEM,
has generated a great deal of research investigating
automatic means of acquiring such knowledge. Much
work has employed carefully constructed parsing
systems to extract knowledge from machine readable
dictionaries (e.g., Vanderwende, 1993). Other
approaches have used rather simpler, statistical
analyses of large corpora, as is done in this work.
Hindle and Rooth (1993) used a rough parser
to extract lexical preferences for prepositional phrase
(PP) attachment. The system counted occurrences of
unambiguously attached PPs and used these to define
LEXICAL ASSOCIATION between prepositions and the
nouns and verbs they modified. This association data
was then used to choose an appropriate attachment for
ambiguous cases. The counting of unambiguous cases
in order to make inferences about ambiguous ones is
adopted in the current work. An explicit assumption is
made that lexical preferences are relatively
independent of the presence of syntactic ambiguity.
Subsequently, Hindle and Rooth&apos; s work has
been extended by Resnik and Hearst (1993). Resnik
and Hearst attempted to include information about
typical prepositional objects in their association data.
They introduced the notion of CONCEPTUAL
ASSOCIATION in which associations are measured
between groups of words considered to represent
concepts, in contrast to single words. Such class-based
approaches are used because they allow each
observation to be generalized thus reducing the amount
of data required. In the current work, a freely available
version of Roget&apos;s thesaurus is used to provide the
grouping of words into concepts, which then form the
basis of conceptual association. The research
presented here can thus be seen as investigating the
application of several key ideas in Hindle and Rooth
(1993) and in Resnik and Hearst (1993) to the solution
of an analogous problem, that of compound noun
analysis. However, both these works were aimed
solely at syntactic disambiguation. The goal of
semantic interpretation remains to be investigated.

METHOD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995803571428571">
Extraction Process: The corpus used to collect
information about compound nouns consists of some
7.8 million words from Grolier&apos;s multimedia on-line
encyclopedia. The University of Pennsylvania
morphological analyser provides a database of more
than 315,000 inflected forms and their parts of speech.
The Grolier&apos;s text was searched for consecutive words
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991154">
337
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999832918918919">
listed in the database as always being nouns and
separated only by white space. This prevented
comma-separated lists and other non-compound noun
sequences from being included. However, it did
eliminate many CNs from consideration because many
nouns are occasionally used as verbs and are thus
ambiguous for part of speech. This resulted in 35,974
noun sequences of which all but 655 were pairs. The
first 1000 of the sequences were examined manually to
check that they were not incidentally adjacent nouns
(as in direct and indirect objects, say). Only 2% did not
form CNs, thus establishing a reasonable utility for the
extraction method. The pairs were then used as a
training set, on the assumption that a two word noun
compound is unambiguously bracketed.&apos;
Thesaurus Categories: The 1911 version of
Roget&apos;s Thesaurus contains 1043 categories, with an
average of 34 single word nouns in each. These
categories were used to define concepts in the sense of
Resnik and Hearst (1993). Each noun in the training
set was tagged with a list of the categories in which it
appeared.&apos; All sequences containing nouns not listed
in Roget&apos;s were discarded from the training set.
Gathering Associations: The remaining
24,285 pairs of category lists were then processed to
find a conceptual association (CA) between every
ordered pair of thesaurus categories (ti, t2) using the
formula below. CA(ti, t2) is the mutual information
between the categories, weighted for ambiguity. It
measures the degree to which the modifying category
predicts the modified category and vice versa. When
categories predict one another, we expect them to be
attached in the syntactic analysis.
Let AMBIG(w) = the number of thesaurus
categories w appears in (the ambiguity of w).
Let COUNT(wi, w2) = the number of instances of
wi modifying w2 in the training set
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.896825142857143">
Let FREQ(ti, t2) =

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.963549666666667">
where i ranges over all possible thesaurus categories.
Note that this measure is asymmetric. CA(th t2)
measures the tendency for t, to modify t2 in a
compound noun, which is distinct from CA(t2, t1).
Automatic Compound Noun Analysis: The
following procedure can be used to syntactically

<bodyText confidence="0.999972666666667">
analyse ambiguous CNs. Suppose the compound
consists of three nouns: w, w2 w3. A left-branching
analysis, [[wi w2] w3] indicates that w, modifies w2,
while a right-branching analysis, [w, [w2 w3]] indicates
that w, modifies something denoted primarily by w3. A
modifier should be associated with words it modifies.
So, when CA(potteiy, mug) &gt;&gt; CA(pottery, coffee), we
prefer (pottery (coffee mug)). First though, we must
choose concepts for the words. For each wi (i = 2 or
3), choose categories Si (with w, in Si) and Ti (with w,
in TO so that CA(Si, TO is greatest. These categories
represent the most significant possible word meanings
for each possible attachment. Then choose wi so that
CA(S„ Ti) is maximum and bracket w, as a sibling of
wi. We have then chosen the attachment having the
most significant association in terms of mutual
information between thesaurus categories.
In compounds longer than three nouns, this
procedure can be generalised by selecting, from all
possible bracketings, that for which the product of
greatest conceptual associations is maximized.

<bodyText confidence="0.998816588235294">
Test Set and Evaluation: Of the noun sequences
extracted from Grolier&apos;s, 655 were more than two
nouns in length and were thus ambiguous. Of these,
308 consisted only of nouns in Roget&apos;s and these
formed the test set. All of them were triples. Using
the full context of each sequence in the test set, the
author analysed each of these, assigning one of four
possible outcomes. Some sequences were not CNs (as
observed above for the extraction process) and were
labeled Error. Other sequences exhibited what Hindle
and Rooth (1993) call SEMANTIC INDETERMINACY,
where the meanings associated with two attachments
cannot be distinguished in the context. For example,
college economics texts. These were labeled
Indeterminate. The remainder were labeled Left or
Right depending on whether the actual analysis is left-
or right-branching.

DISCUSSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993758">
Related Work: There are two notable systems that
are related to the current work. The SENS system
described in Vanderwende (1993) extracted semantic
features from machine readable dictionaries by means
of structural patterns applied to definitions. These
features were then matched by heuristics which
assigned likelihood estimates to each possible semantic
relationship. The work only addressed the
interpretation of pairs of nouns and did not mention the
problem of syntactic ambiguity.
A very simple technique aimed at bracketing
ambiguous compound nouns is reported in
Pustejovsky et al. (1993). While attempting to extract
taxonomic relationships, their system heuristically
bracketed CNs by searching elsewhere in the corpus
for subcomponents of the compound. Such matching
fails to take account of the natural frequency of the
words and is likely to require a much larger corpus for
accurate results. Unfortunately, they provide no
evaluation of the performance afforded by their
approach.
Future Plans: A more sophisticated noun
sequence extraction method should improve the
results, providing more and cleaner training data.
Also, many sequences had to be discarded because
they contained nouns not in the 1911 Roget&apos;s. A more
comprehensive and consistent thesaurus needs to be
used.
An investigation of different association
schemes is also planned. There are various statistical
measures other than mutual information, which have
been shown to be more effective in some studies.
Association measures can also be devised that allow
evidence from several categories to be combined.
Compound noun analyses often depend on
contextual factors. Any analysis based solely on the
static semantics of the nouns in the compound cannot
account for these effects. To establish an achievable
performance target for context free analysis, an
experiment is planned using human subjects, who will
be given ambiguous noun compounds and asked to
choose attachments for them.
Finally, syntactic bracketing is only the first
step in interpreting compound nouns. Once an
attachment is established, a semantic role needs to be
selected as is done in SENS. Given the promising
results achieved for syntactic preferences, it seems
likely that semantic preferences can also be extracted
from corpora. This is the main area of ongoing
research within the project.

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952583333333">
The current work uses thesaurus category associations
gathered from an on-line encyclopedia to make
analyses of compound nouns. An initial study of the
syntactic disambiguation of 244 compound nouns has
shown promising results, with an accuracy of 75%.
Several enhancements are planned along with an
experiment on human subjects to establish a
performance target for systems based on static
semantic analyses. The extension to semantic
interpretation of compounds is the next step and
represents promising unexplored territory for corpus
statistics.

The work only addressed the interpretation of pairs of nouns and did not mention the problem of syntactic ambiguity. A very simple technique aimed at bracketing ambiguous compound nouns is reported in Pustejovsky et al. (1993). While attempting to extract taxonomic relationships, their system heuristically bracketed CNs by searching elsewhere in the corpu</context>
