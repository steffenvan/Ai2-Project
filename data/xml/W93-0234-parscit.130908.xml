The organization of discourse is multifaceted. Theories that take a single perspective on
discourse structure, examining for example only goal satisfaction or textual coherence or ignoring
the context in which a text was generated, will fail to identify the full functional significance of
the content and organization of text. The task of generating coherent text to meet some commu-
nicative intentions requires consideration of a number of constraints on content and organization
that manifest in different ways in the end-product. Therefore the task of analyzing a text with
respect to its coherence and intended functionality requires factoring distinct influences on the
organization of the text itself.

Diverse Accounts of Coherence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994437037037">
Various accounts of discourse coherence have been offered in the literature, each with their
own merits and limitations. For example, Grosz &amp; Sidner [1986] defined a coherent discourse to be
one in which a single discourse purpose is &amp;quot;shared bffy all the participants and when each utterance
of the discourse contributes to achieving this purpose.&amp;quot; Grosz and Sidner provided a clear account
of certain aspects of the hierarchical and prerequisite structure of discourse. However they did
not address the variety of communicative roles that sibling text segments can play with respect
to each other.
Intersegmental coherence is the concern of rhetorical structure theory (RST), whose propo-
nents have stated (in various forms, and most directly by Hovy [1988]) that a coherent text is
one in which each contiguous segment of text is related by a rhetorical relation. This claim is
concisely stated, easy to understand and apply, and intuitively appealing. However it is deficient
in being too weak in explanatory power and too strong in its conditions for coherence. It is
too weak because the rhetorical relations themselves were developed by identifying relationships
between contiguous segments of text in a corpus of texts considered to be coherent. Because
of this circularity, the rhetorical characterization of coherence does not account for the sources
of coherence or say why the text is coherent: the rhetorical relations are merely descriptive of
coherent text. The claim is too strong because coherence does not necessarily require rhetorical
relations between every contiguous segment of a text. The ordering of a text can be arbitrary at
points. There is unlikely to be a well motivated rhetorical relation between those segments whose
contiguity is arbitrary. This problem has shown up in text generation: Moore 8i Paris [1991]
encountered certain difficulties in the design of their explanation planner that they attributed to
the requirement that a rhetorical relation be present between each pair of contiguous segments
in a plan. RST has also been criticized for conflating different kinds of relations that should be
distinguished [Grosz &amp; Sidner 1986, Moore &amp; Pollack 1993, Suthers 1990].
Finally, Hobbs&apos; [1979] characterization of coherence as the ease of inferring coherence rela-
tions linking the parts of the text has also been criticized on the basis that the coherence relations
serve no purpose once they have been inferred. The reader is more concerned with discerning

the communicative intent of a text than with verifying its coherence, and the theoretician should
be as well. The relations by which coherence is defined should be independently motivated for
reasons of communicative functionality. This view is not inconsistent with the view that co-
herence relations must be recognized to succeed in making a text coherent. The former simply
requires that coherence relations serve some communicative function other than being recognized
as contributing to coherence. Hobbs&apos; characterization can be restated as follows: a discourse is
coherent to the extent that it makes its communicative functionality plain. However this leaves
us with the question of precisely which functionally motivated relations are needed to account for
coherence, and how these relations can provide a structural &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; for coherence that replaces the
initial approximation provided by Hovy&apos;s interpretation of RST.

Some Aspects of Discourse Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99988775">
My own work [Suthers 1993a] has been concerned with explanation as a question-answering
activity in an instructional setting. I have found it necessary to distinguish the following structural
aspects because each requires examination of a different source of information and/or application
of a different kind of planning knowledge:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99816524">
1. Exchange Structure: The appropriateness of the dominating rhetorical actsl with respect
to expectations created by prior exchanges. (Is the rhetorical act appropriate for the question
just asked? Is the question being deferred?)
2. Informative Structure (a special kind of goal satisfaction): The relevance of expressed
information for performing an intended rhetorical act. (E.g., When does a causal, functional,
or structural description constitute an answer to a question?)
3. Propositional Structure (a.k.a. &amp;quot;informational&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ideational&amp;quot;): The propositional
inter-relatedness of references to different domain entities in a given communicative act.2
(What propositions are being expressed? How is each entity that is mentioned related to
the topic?)
4. &amp;quot;Contextual structure&amp;quot; in [Suthers 1993a] (but better understood in terms of tradeoffs
between context-sensitive constraints on content choice rather than as structural): The
appropriateness of the contents of a communicative act in the context of the knowledge
available to the interlocutors and the knowledge expressed in prior dialogue. (E.g., does the
utterance provide new information? Does it elaborate on an explanation or argument under
construction?)
5. Supplemental Structure: The ways in which one segment plays a supporting role with
respect to another segment, such as facilitating comprehension or retention [Zukerman 1990].
Supplemental relations correspond roughly to those rhetorical relations where nuclearity is
determined by intention rather than information. As Moore &amp; Moser note in their workshop
abstract, these provide different kinds of dominance.
6. Sequential Structure: the consistency of the sequential presentation of the units of an ex-
planation at all granularities with their intended communicative functionality. A partial
ordering in terms of constraints derived from the above functional relationships [Suthers
1993b].

Based on this structural taxonomy, two concise (though oversimplified) conditions for a co-
herent explanation can be stated:
• The graph of informative, supplemental, and propositional relations between segments is a
connected graph meeting the definitions of these relations (i.e., there are no isolated units of
analysis, weaker than requiring a relation between each contiguous pair of units).
• The sequencing of the segments is consistent with the intended communicative functionality
of the segments, the functionality being discerned by the aforementioned relations [Suthers
19934
(Given a more adequate treatment of exchange structure, the conditions could be extended to
include the appropriateness of the dominating rhetorical acts for the exchange context.) This
characterization of coherence addresses the weakness of the previous accounts by identifying the
sources of coherence in independently motivated constraints on the content and organization of
an explanation without unnecessarily strong conditions or assumptions about hearer inferences.
Additionally, the proliferation of coherence relations is reduced by separating supplemental roles
from domain-specific relations.
My argument for the above taxonomy depends on my theoretical assumptions about the text
planning process rather than on direct linguistic evidence. This deficiency can be addressed by
empirical work. However, regardless of whether this particular taxonomy proves to be the most
useful, I expect that it is plausible enough to make the point that a complete description of the
coherence and communicative functionality of discourse requires acknowledgment of functionally
distinct categories of relationships between segments, not just different relationships within a
category. This is especially the case in text genres that mix informational and intentional goals
(such as instructional texts). As Owen Rambow pointed out in his workshop abstract, such genres
require the development of new text planning architectures — the primary topic of Suthers [19934
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988791">
Some Remaining Questions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967332833333333">
I believe that the need to consider the above aspects of discourse structure during text
planning is fairly well established. (I take the above list to be an approximation to a lower bound,
being the items I needed to process in my own planner.) The question remains: which aspects
of discourse structure are processed by an agent in understanding a text? This is an empirical
question which I won&apos;t speculate on further here. However it should be noted that the above
characterization of coherence is oriented towards the needs of generation rather than the process
of comprehension. &amp;quot;Coherence&amp;quot; from the point of view of the understander need not be the same
as &amp;quot;coherence&amp;quot; from the point of view of the generator, as their processing requirements may
differ.
A related question is whether coherence is the combined effect of its aspects identified by the
analyst, or whether it suffices to attend to only one source of coherence when many are possible.
Gisela Redeker3 argues that a hearer need only recognize the presence of one coherence relation;
therefore when multiple relations hold between two segments (ideational, rhetorical, or segmental
in her terminology), the speaker can choose which to mark. (She provides evidence that one
could have marked both.) Yet marker choice does not rule out the need to process other aspects
of coherence, for example the planner must decide whether and how to use an ideational (e.g.
causal) relation in constructing a rhetorical (e.g., evidential) one.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994902">
Both the analysis and generation of coherent and functional text depend on the coordina-
tion of multiple types of structural relations at different granularities. It is not productive to
view discourse structure as consisting of a single class of relations: one risks omitting or con-
flating relevant yet distinct functionalities and sources of coherence. The author has proposed
distinctions between exchange, informative, propositional, contextual, supplemental, and sequen-
tial structure [Suthers 19934 these differentiate types of intentional and rhetorical structure.
Improved taxonomies are possible and may depend on whether one is primarily interested in
modeling generation or understanding. Regardless, we need to deal with multiple descriptions
when analyzing a text. The community should focus on factoring functionally distinct aspects of
discourse structure according to their functionality in generation and understanding processes.

Finally, Hobbs&apos; [1979] characterization of coherence as the ease of inferring coherence relations linking the parts of the text has also been criticized on the basis that the coherence relations serve no purpose once they have been inferred. The reader is more concerned with discerning 128 the communicative intent of a text than with verifying its coherence, and the theoretician should be as well. The relations by which coherence is defined should be independently motivated for reasons of communicative functionality. This view is not inconsistent with the view that coherence relations must </context>

Hobbs&apos; characterization can be restated as follows: a discourse is coherent to the extent that it makes its communicative functionality plain. However this leaves us with the question of precisely which functionally motivated relations are needed to account for coherence, and how these relations can provide a structural &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; for coherence that replaces the initial approximation provided by Hovy&apos;s interpretation of RST. Some Aspects of Discourse Structure My own work [Suthers 1993a] has been concerned with explanation as a question-answering activity in an instructional setting. I have found it necessary to distinguish the following structural aspects because each requires examination of a different source of information and/or application of a different kind of planning knowledge: 1. Exchange Structure: The appropriateness of the dominating rhetorical actsl with respect to expectations created by prior exchanges. (Is the rhetorical act appropriate for the question just asked? Is the question being deferred?) 2. Informative Structure (a special kind of goal satisfactio</context>

Supplemental relations correspond roughly to those rhetorical relations where nuclearity is determined by intention rather than information. As Moore &amp; Moser note in their workshop abstract, these provide different kinds of dominance. 6. Sequential Structure: the consistency of the sequential presentation of the units of an explanation at all granularities with their intended communicative functionality. A partial ordering in terms of constraints derived from the above functional relationships [Suthers 1993b]. &apos;One of 14 rhetorical illocutions (account, compare, define, describe, illustrate, ...) applied to a topic (entity reference or proposition). 2A communicative illocution (assent, inform, dissent, request) applied to one or more propositions. 129 Based on this structural taxonomy, two concise (though oversimplified) conditions for a coherent explanation can be stated: • The graph of informative, supplemental, and propositional relations between segments is a connected graph meeting the definitions of these relations (i.e., there are no isolated units of analysis, weaker than requiring a rel</context>
