Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99973325">
This is a description of an ongoing training
effort to teach the use of translation tools like
translation memories or terminology databases
in live online seminars over the internet.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.999025" genericHeader="keywords">
1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998548">
Translation tools are very complex and usually
require 1 to 2 days of training at the beginning. But
most users do not have the time or financial means
to go on a two-day training. Now, with a (not so)
new development in web technology, called virtual
training, the knowledge transfer can take place in
easy sessions of 1 to 2 hours and each participant
can access this live training with a phone and an
internet connection.
This presentation will show how the material for
a tools training had to be adapted to the situation of
a live training on the internet and what the trainer
should and should not do. The presenter will share
personal experience on virtual training sessions
with the participants.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.972465" genericHeader="introduction">
2 The Idea
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999752">
As a trainer for translation tools, I usually hold
one- or two-day training classes to teach the
participants how to use translation memory
systems, alignment systems and terminology
databases. It is a mix of overview presentations,
hands-on training - either trainer and participants
in parallel or participants on their own - and
question and answer sessions on topics that arise
out of the use of the tools or specific issues the
participants have had in the past.
Many of my participants tell me that they finally
decided to a take training class, after having tried
to get along with the tools by themselves for quite
some time and finding that they cannot use the
tools efficiently as they don&apos;t know how to use all
the features available. Some had used the tools for
years and found during our class that there would
have been an easier way of doing things if they had
just known it.
Also, many would like to go to a training class,
but either have no local dealer/training center that
offers such a training or simply cannot afford to be
away from work for 2 or 3 days. For freelancers
especially, the cost of training, travel and time
away from work is sometimes prohibitive.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.997625" genericHeader="method">
3 The Technology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881824561404">
This was the starting point for me to explore,
whether there was some kind of technology that
would allow remote training classes for all those
who could not participate in a regular training for
whatever reason. Video conferencing was one
possibility, but the equipment for that was just too
expensive, so I turned to the internet. Taping
classes was another idea, but here amount of time
and money that had to be spent on keeping the
tapes up-to-date was too high. And it lacked the
interactive component that is crucial to software
training classes.
I found a technology that is often called &amp;quot;virtual
meeting center&amp;quot; and that promised to offer all the
things I needed. The ability to meet on the internet
in real time independent of country or time, an
accompanying phone conference functionality and
an &amp;quot;application sharing&amp;quot; feature that would allow
me to show the software to be worked with.
A virtual meeting basically is a website where all
participants log into at the same time, password
protected of course. They come to a meeting space
that shows a window where the trainer can load
documents or presentations. Also there are usually
a chat window for written conversation and a list
of participants to one side of the screen. For
collaborative work there is a whiteboard feature
that lets all participants draw onto the same space
in the presentation window.
To train software this way, the trainer can use
the &amp;quot;application sharing&amp;quot; feature. Whichever
application he/she starts will be visible on the
screens of all participants (with a small delay
depending on the speed of the internet
connections). It is also possible to have some of the
participants show their screen to the rest of the
group.
The voice part of the meeting can be managed
by a phone conference in parallel or by also using
the internet with so-called &amp;quot;voice-over-IP&amp;quot;, so that
no additional phone call is necessary.
The usage of the platform is usually billed per
minute per user. Phone conferences are billed
extra, voice-over-IP is included in the meeting
minute price.
There are now many platforms that offer virtual
meeting space. To find the one that suits trainer
and participants best, I tested several of them
(please find a list of some meeting platforms at the
end of this document).
To be able to use this technology effectively, I
found it useful for the trainer to use a headset
instead of holding the phone receiver, to keep both
hands free for typing and navigating the
applications. For voice-over-IP this is a must
anyway. Participants may use a headset as well,
but don&apos;t have to.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995448">
3.1 Costs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999595636363637">
Prices vary from platform to platform. Usually
there is a fee per minute per participant plus an
additional fee, if the phone conference system will
be used as well. But everybody can use their own
phone conference system, it is not mandatory to
book it with the meeting platform. If regular
sessions are planned, then there are also monthly
or yearly arrangements possible for the use of the
meeting platform. Per minute prices range between
8 cents to 45 cents per user, depending on the
provider and the services used.

4 The Training Material
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985875">
As nobody can sit in front of a computer fully
concentrated for a whole day, the training had to be
split up into several smaller sessions, so had to be
the training material.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998491">
4.1 Preparing the Training Material
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984925">
It was found that 1.5 to 2-hour sessions were the
maximum that participants and trainer could
comfortably sit through, so the training material
had to be split up into modules of that length. Also,
the training needed to include some time for
presentation by the teacher as well as for hands-on
time for the participants.
The modules were defined by a logical sequence
of functionalities that might be shown during one
session. Each module was broken down into
detailed steps, as in the following example of two
Trados MultiTerm sessions.

<bodyText confidence="0.953071625">
In the end the training schedule became a very
detailed table of actions with specific times set for
each action. The schedule was tested with two beta
groups to see whether the combination of
presentation and hands-on time and the overall
session length was working for everybody.
Example schedule for a part of a session on
Trados WinAlign:

<bodyText confidence="0.999955857142857">
The schedule needs to be as detailed as possible
and the trainer should strictly adhere to it, that is,
the amount of time needed to show a certain
feature needs to be measured exactly.
To be able to hold a training session over the
internet the training needs to be meticulously
prepared and the trainer needs to be very familiar
with the meeting platform so as to be able to help
each participant if problems arise with log-in,
screen resolution or other.
When structuring the material into modules, it
can also be defined which modules are prerequisite
for what other modules and which can be taken as
stand alone modules, like in the following matrix:

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988666666667">
Each participant needs a computer with access to
the internet (a 56k-modem works OK but faster
connections like ISDN or DSL are to be preferred).
For a phone conference in parallel, an additional
phone line is needed. Participants who only have
access to one phone line can also use the chat
functionality to ask questions or the class uses
voice-over-IP altogether.
The trainer should use a headset to keep the
hands free for typing in the chat area and showing
the software features. Students can also use
headsets which is particularly useful if the training
session includes hands-on training time. If voice-
over-IP is used, all participants need to have
headsets connected to their computer.

6 Training
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.978559">
6.1 Classroom Training versus Online
Training
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976675">
The online training situation is very much
different from a classroom training where the
trainer can communicate directly with the
participants.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.832901">
6.1.1 In the Classroom
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896285714286">
The trainer has direct contact to the participants
and can see whether they are comfortable with the
pace set by the trainer. Questioning looks, nods,
frowns and gestures tell the trainer a lot about how
the participants feel, whether they are following
the topic, whether they need more time or if the
speed of teaching can be increased.
Questions that can be answered with a nod
instead of &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; can give the trainer feedback on
the situation in the class.
The trainer can walk through the classroom and
work with students individually if help is needed or
if there is an issue specific to one computer or one
participant.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.588924">
6.1.2 In the Virtual Classroom
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965260869565">
The trainer does not see the participants, so has
no way of knowing if the pace is too fast or too
slow and whether the participants are still there,
bored or just listening intently, when it is quiet at
the other end of the line.
A question like &amp;quot;Can we go on?&amp;quot; usually does
not get any feedback so the trainer has to rephrase
the question into something like &amp;quot;Who does have a
question so far?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Who does not see the picture
of ... on the screen?&amp;quot;
The trainer has to request feedback actively
much more often than in a face-to-face classroom
situation, as most participants will only ask when
directly spoken to. This is one reason why a 2-hour
session is already a very demanding time span for
an online trainer.
The trainer cannot observe what participants do.
The participants must ask for help themselves, so
the trainer must make it easy for them to ask. For
example by talking about what can go wrong or
recounting own experiences with the use of the
tool at the beginning and asking frequently if there
are any questions.
</bodyText>

7 Trainer Skills
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989585365854">
The trainer needs to be familiar with the
technology of the platform that is used. Log-in
difficulties, switching between windows/screens
and other technical questions the participants may
have, need to be addressed instantly and
competently. (For technical difficulties at log-in
and such the provider of the platform usually has a
technical hotline - the trainer might need a separate
phone line to contact this hotline without leaving
the group alone.)
As the screen for the trainer and the participants
may look differently (number of menus or buttons
available), the trainer should know what the
participants can see and what they can&apos;t see. For
the first meetings it might make sense for the
trainer to be logged in twice - once as a trainer and
once as a participant. This will increase cost, as the
platform has to be paid for by minute per
participant, but it helps the trainer to control what
the group can see or do.
As an absolute MUST, the trainer has to include
a &amp;quot;get-to-know-the-technology&amp;quot; session for each
group at the beginning of a new class or whenever
a new participant joins the group. This should
include a short introduction of the meeting window
with all the functionalities that are available, i.e.
chat area, participants list, question button (to
signal the trainer that one wants to ask a question),
menus and commands to share an application and
so on.
Another obstacle might be screen size. If the
trainer has a larger screen than the participants and
works in full screen mode for application sharing
for example, the participants will not be able to see
all of the trainer&apos;s screen. This has to be checked in
the first meeting as well, so that the trainer can
adjust the window size of what he/she is showing,
to the size of what all participants can see on their
screens.
This can take up to 10 minutes and should be
included in the session schedule.
On the first meeting a short round of
introductions should be held. If available the
participants / trainer can show a video picture or a
picture in a graphics file to the group and introduce
themselves. Most platforms offer a small window
where the trainer can show his video cam picture
during the training, but as this tends to distract
people from the contents of the session, it should
be used sparingly. Another thing to test in the first
session is the connection speed of all participants.
After starting a test screen the trainer should ask
the participants for feedback at what moment they
are able to see the whole screen as well. This time
span has to be kept in mind during the complete
session. Before going on to show a feature or going
to the next slide of a presentation the participants
should have enough time to take a look at each
screen.
The chat area also tends to be used a lot during a
session. Here the trainer can limit the use by only
allowing the participants to either send chat
information to all other participants or to the
trainer alone. Chat amongst group members should
be disabled, especially if some of the group
members know each other already.
The trainer needs to do some multitasking -
presenting the session content, explaining the
session content verbally, keep an eye on the chat
area as well as on the &amp;quot;raise hand&amp;quot; feature of the
meeting window in case somebody wants to ask a
question (this is especially true for sessions using
the voice-over-IP functionality, as this does not
really allow a good two-way communication
because of the delay of sound which can be up to 5
seconds. In which time the other person might
have decided that nothing was coming forth and
started talking again. In this case the two sound
information pieces would overlay each other,
making it very hard to understand who said what.
So usually the trainer has to give over the right to
speak to another participant and he/she has to give
it back when finished). This is a very demanding
job so the meeting needs to be as well prepared as
possible. All applications that will be shown, all
documents and presentations that will be loaded to
the meeting window have to be present and open
before the meeting starts. Looking for a file to
show during a meeting does not give a very
professional impression as well as costing time and
money.
All along the session, from the greeting of the
participants, the introduction to the technology and
throughout the session, the trainer will always have
to explain what he/she is doing at the moment.
Especially if some of the participants have a slower
connection than others, the next screen to be
shown should be explained until everybody can see
it on their screens. Asking often if there are any
questions or if anybody cannot see the screen or
complete the task in a hands-on period, helps to
bridge those silences that tend to come up in phone
conferences when nobody knows what is coming
next. And it also helps participants to ask their
questions which they might not dare ask otherwise
for fear of interrupting the trainer. Again this is
very demanding on the trainer, so that a 2 hour
session is probably the most an internet session
should last.
Also the trainer needs to be very aware of his/her
actions on the screen. Using the mouse pointer to
show or circle some item on the screen should be
done deliberately and slowly otherwise the
participants will only see a fuzzy, uncoordinated
motion on their screens. Mouse pointers should be
used only if really necessary.
Another very valuable feature is the possibility
to &amp;quot;tape&amp;quot; the session. A session can be recorded for
later reuse, recap or for example if a presentation
has to be given several times and should always
look the same. These can usually be viewed with a
special viewer that is provided by the platform
provider.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.970805" genericHeader="method">
8 Training Mix
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999465933333333">
Presentations using this kind of meeting place
should not take more than 30 minutes as the
attention span will decrease drastically after that
time if no interaction of any kind is possible.
The training mix that seems to work quite well
for a software training, is a session with
introduction into the topic, possibly by some
PowerPoint slides. Then followed by a short
presentation with the application itself (about 15
minutes) with accompanying explanations. After
that the participants get between 10 to 15 minutes
to recreate what they have just seen on their own
screen. Files or example material for these hands-
on periods may be distributed before the session by
email or can be sent to the participants directly via
the meeting platform (if this feature is available).
The steps to be taken during this hands-on period
can be listed in a window of the meeting window,
as a simple document or a slide of a PowerPoint
presentation, so that participants can look it up any
time they need it.
After the session the trainer can use polling
features to either ask session related questions
(multiple/single choice) or this feature can be used
to get feedback on the overall feeling about the
session (Was the content useful? Was the session
too short/too long?...). Mostly those polling
features give back an anonymous result in form of
percentages. The poll needs to be prepared in
advance and can be saved as a file for later reuse.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.864236" genericHeader="method">
9 Group Size
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999600625">
In face-to-face software classes you can have up
to 20 people, but probably would not consider
doing the whole course with only 2 participants.
(OK, 6-8 participants is the ideal number of people
for a group in software training but reality often
teaches that this number is usually exceeded).
Online training sessions should definitely not have
more than 6-8 people, as it will be very hard to
help each participant with individual questions in
the limited timeframe. For presentation-only
sessions, the number is practically only limited by
the number of participants the platform provider
allows per session (if such limitations exist at all).
But a group of 2 or even an individual training
session is still possible and much less expensive
than doing this in a classroom.

10 Actual Training Sessions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995775">
The above experiences were attained by
evaluating the technologies of virtual meeting
platforms and holding several training classes on
the use of Trados tools.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.697814">
10.1 Sessions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999846428571428">
Basically, the standard training class for 3
Trados tools, Translator&apos;s Workbench, MultiTerm
and WinAlign which are usually taught within a
two-day training were split up into modules with 2-
hour sessions. 2 sessions for the WinAlign module,
2 sessions for the MultiTerm module and 4
sessions for the Translator&apos;s Workbench.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.848521">
10.2 Training Sequence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996">
Each session was started with an overview over
the contents of the whole module and the contents
of the individual session.
Each topic in each session was organized as in
the schedule shown above (Table 2). An
introduction with PowerPoint where necessary, a
live demonstration of the topic, sending of
prepared demo files where necessary, hands-on
period with questions and anwers if required.
The files that were sent to the participants either
included a small step-by-step instruction sheet or
the instructions were shown in the meeting place of
the online platform for reference.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.629444">
10.3 Timing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998575">
The sessions were held twice a week for 4 to 5
weeks depending on the availability of the
participants. The trainer was located in Germany
whereas most of the participants were located in
the United States. This made it necessary for the
trainer to hold the sessions in the evening between
Bpm and 10pm, so that the participants were able
to take the sessions during their workday.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.832899" genericHeader="method">
10.4 Participants
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978230769231">
Initially, the training was developed with the
freelance translator in mind. This target group has
to get aquainted with the tools but often does not
have the time or financial means to also pay for
travel and training costs. A mailing was sent out to
freelance translators, project managers and
localization managers.
The profiles of the participants showed that most
of them were project managers instead of the
translators that this course was targeted at in the
first place. And it showed that the setup of the
training, with its focus on hands-on training was
interesting for project managers as well but not
exactly the most efficient way for them. Project
managers need a rather detailed overview, so that
they know what functionalities are available and
how they will make their life easier, but they do
not necessarily need to know all the details of
handling a tool as a translator would. Also, the
hands-on phases were not so important for them, as
they did not need to practice as much as a
translator. Partly because they usually feel more at
home with a computer and are very quick in
understanding the underlying techniques and ideas.
Partly because they will only use some few
features of all the ones a translator might use.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949083333333">
The second group also consisted mainly of
project managers, therefore the contents and
schedule of the sessions were adapted in such a
way as to give an overview over all functionalities
that might be helpful for project managers and only
showing the ones that related to the actual
translating. Also, in the introduction to each topic
there was added a short example of where this
featuer might be used. At the end of each topic, the
trainer added some advice about possible problems
that might occurr with a given functionality and
solutions for them.

It also showed that as a trainer you have to feel
very much at home with a computer and the
internet in order to enjoy live online classes and be
able to switch between the hands-on part, where
the actual application is running on the computer
of the participant and the presentation part, where
they only see the screen of the trainer, without
confusing the applications.

12 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926210526316">
While live online sessions are definitely a good
way to cut down on training expenses, it cannot be
an only substitute for a face-to-face classroom
training, also it is not the ideal solution for every
user. It needs a lot of preparation and timing and is
very demanding on the trainer regarding
communication with the participants and attention
to a detailed training session plan.
It is however a very flexible alternative to
phone-only conferences and a very effective way
to get collaboration on an internationally
distributed team or training group. As connections
to the internet get more speedy and less expensive
there is a great opportunity to deliver more live
online training sessions over the web. Also it is to
be expected that voice-over-IP will improve a lot
within the next few years so that parallel phone
conferences will not be needed that much any
more.
