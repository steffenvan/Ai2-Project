We present a follow-up of our previous fre-
quency-based greedy attribute selection strate-
gy. The current version takes into account also
the instructions given to the participants of
TUNA trials regarding the use of location in-
formation, showing an overall improvement
on string-edit distance values driven by the re-
sults on the Furniture domain.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999763555555556">
In previous work (Lucena &amp; Paraboni, 2008) we
presented a frequency-based greedy attribute se-
lection strategy submitted to the TUNA Chal-
lenge 2008. Presently we further the issue by
taking additional information into account -
namely, the trial condition information available
from the TUNA data - and report improved re-
sults for string-edit distance as required for the
2009 competition.

2 Background

<bodyText confidence="0.997733">
In Lucena &amp; Paraboni (2008) we presented a
combined strategy based on attribute frequency
and certain aspects of a greedy attribute selection
strategy for referring expressions generation. A
list P of attributes sorted by frequency is the cen-
tre piece of the following selection strategy:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9646375">
• select all attributes whose relative frequency
falls above a threshold value t (t was esti-
mated to be 0.8 for both Furniture and
People domains.)
• if the resulting description uniquely de-
scribes the target object, then finalizes.
• if not, starting from the most frequent
attribute in P, search exhaustively for an
attribute g such that g, if selected, would rule
out all remaining distractors in the context.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999309375">
The overall effect obtained is twofold: on the
one hand, in a complex situation of reference (in
which many attributes may rule out many dis-
tractors, but more than one will be required to
achieve uniqueness) the algorithm simply selects
frequent attributes. This may be comparable to a
human speaker who has to single out the target
object but who does not have the means to come
up with the ‘right’ attribute straight away.
On the other hand, as the number of distractors
decreases, a single attribute capable of ruling out
all distractors will eventually emerge, forcing the
algorithm to switch to a greedy strategy and fi-
nalize. Once again, this may be comparable to
what a human speaker may do when an appropri-
ate attribute becomes sufficiently salient and all
distractors in the context can be ruled out at
once.
The above approach performed fairly well (at
least considering its simplicity) as reported in
Lucena &amp; Paraboni (2008). However, there is
one major source of information available from
the TUNA data that was not taken into account
in the above strategy: the trial condition
represented by the +/- LOC feature. Because this
feature distinguishes the very kinds of instruction
given to each participant to complete the TUNA
task, the information provided by -/+ LOC is
likely to have a significant impact on the overall
results. This clear gap in our previous work
represents an opportunity for improvement dis-
cussed in the next section.

The present work is a refined version of the
original frequency-based greedy attribute selec-
tion strategy submitted to the TUNA Challenge
2008 (Lucena &amp; Paraboni, 2008), now taking
also the trial condition (+/-LOC) into account.

In the TUNA data, +LOC indicates the in-
stances of the experiment in which participants
were told that they were allowed to refer to the
X,Y coordinates of the screen (i.e., selecting the
X- and/or Y-DIMENSION attributes), whereas
-LOC indicates the trials in which they were dis-
couraged (but not prevented) to do so. In prac-
tice, references in +LOC trials are more likely to
convey the X- and Y-DIMENSION attributes
than those in which the -LOC condition was ap-
plied.
Our modified algorithm simply consists of
computing separated frequency lists for +LOC
and -LOC trial conditions, and then using the
original frequency-based greedy approach with
each list accordingly. In practice, descriptions are
now generated in two different ways, depending
on the trial condition, which may promote the X-
and Y-DIMENSION attributes to higher posi-
tions in the list P when +LOC applies.
Using the TUNA Challenge 2009 develop-
ment data set, the attribute selection task was
performed as above. For the surface realisation
task, we have reused the English language sur-
face realisation module provided by Irene Lang-
kilde-Geary for the TUNA Challenge 2008.

4 Results

<bodyText confidence="0.999785575757576">
The following Figure 1 shows mean sting-edit
distance and BLEU-3 scores computed using the
evaluation tool provided by the TUNA Challenge
team. For ease of comparison with our previous
work, we also present Dice and MASI scores
computed as in the previous TUNA Challenge,
although these scores were not required for the
current competition.
The most relevant comparison with our previ-
ous work is observed in the overall string-edit
distance values in Figure 1: considering that in
Lucena &amp; Paraboni (2008) we reported 6.12 edit-
distance for Furniture and 7.38 for People, the
overall improvement (driven by the descriptions
in the Furniture domain) may be explained by the
fact that the current version makes more accurate
decisions as to when to use these attributes ac-
cording to the instructions given to the partici-
pants of the TUNA trials (the trial condition +/-
LOC. )
On the other hand, the divide between +LOC
and -LOC strategies does not have a significant
effect on the results based on the semantics of
the description (i.e., Dice and MASI scores),
which remain the same as those obtained previ-
ously. This may be explained by the fact that us-
ing location information inappropriately counts
as one single error in Dice/MASI calculations,
but it may have a much greater impact on the
wording of the surface string (e.g., one single use
of the X-DIMENSION attribute may be realized
as “on the far left”, adding four words to the de-
scriptions.)

We have presented a refined version of our pre-
vious frequency-based greedy attribute selection
strategy. The current version takes into account
the instructions given to the participants of
TUNA trials regarding the use of location infor-
mation (the trial condition +/-LOC.)
Results obtained using the TUNA Challenge
2009 development data set show improvements
on string-edit distance, suggesting that the gener-
ated descriptions resemble more closely those
seen in the TUNA corpus.
