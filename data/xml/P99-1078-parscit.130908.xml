We present work on the automatic generation of
short indicative-informative abstracts of scien-
tific and technical articles. The indicative part
of the abstract identifies the topics of the docu-
ment while the informative part of the abstract
elaborate some topics according to the reader&apos;s
interest by motivating the topics, describing en-
tities and defining concepts. We have defined
our method of automatic abstracting by study-
ing a corpus professional abstracts. The method
also considers the reader&apos;s interest as essential
in the process of abstracting.

<bodyText confidence="0.999943310344828">
The idea of producing abstracts or summaries
by automatic means is not new, several
methodologies have been proposed and tested
for automatic abstracting including among
others: word distribution (Luhn, 1958); rhetor-
ical analysis (Marcu, 1997); and probabilistic
models (Kupiec et al., 1995). Even though
some approaches produce acceptable abstracts
for specific tasks, it is generally agreed that
the problem of coherent selection and expres-
sion of information in automatic abstracting
remains (Johnson, 1995). One of the main
problems is how to ensure the preservation of
the message of the original text if sentences
picked up from distant parts of the source text
are juxtaposed and presented to the reader.
Rino and Scott (1996) address the problem of
coherent selection for gist preservation, however
they depend on the availability of a complex
meaning representation which in practice is
difficult to obtain from the raw text.
In our work, we are concerned with the auto-
matic generation of short indicative-informative
abstract for technical and scientific papers. We
base our methodology on a study of a corpus of
professional abstracts and source or parent doc-
uments. Our method also considers the reader&apos;s
interest as essential in the process of abstract-
ing.

The production of professional abstracts has
long been object of study (Cremmins, 1982). In
particular, it has been argued that structural
parts of parent documents such as introduc-
tions and conclusions are important in order to
obtain the information for the topical sentence
(Endres-Niggemeyer et al., 1995). We have been
investigating which kind of information is re-
ported in professional abstracts as well as where
the information lies in parent documents and
how it is conveyed. In Figure 1, we show a pro-
fessional abstract from the &amp;quot;Computer and Con-
trol Abstracts&amp;quot; journal, this kind of abstract
aims to alert readers about the existence of a
new article in a particular field. The example
contains information about the author&apos;s inter-
est, the author&apos;s development and the overview
of the parent document. All the information
reported in this abstract was found in the in-
troduction of its parent document.
In order to study the aforementioned aspects,
we have manually aligned sentences of 100 pro-
fessional abstracts with sentences of parent doc-
uments containing the information reported in
the abstract. In a previous study (Saggion and
Lapalme, 1998), we have shown that 72% of the
information in professional abstracts lies in ti-
tles, captions, first sections and last sections of
parent documents while the rest of the informa-
tion was found in author abstracts and other
sections. These results suggest that some struc-
tural sections are particularly important in or-
der to select information for an abstract but also

The production of understandable and maintainable expert systems using the current gen-
eration of multiparadigm development tools is addressed. This issue is discussed in the
context of COMPASS, a large and complex expert system that helps maintain an elec-
tronic telephone exchange. As part of the work on COMPASS, several techniques to aid
maintainability were developed and successfully implemented. Some of the techniques were
new, others were derived from traditional software engineering but modified to fit the rapid
prototyping approach of expert system building. An overview of the COMPASS project is
presented, software problem areas are identified, solutions adopted in the final system are
described and how these solutions can be generalized is discussed.

The complex process of scientific discovery
that starts with the identification of a research
problem and eventually ends with an answer to
the problem (Bunge, 1967), would generally be
disseminated in a technical or scientific paper:
a complex record of knowledge containing,
among others, references to the following con-
cepts the author, the author&apos;s affiliation, others
authors, the authors&apos; development, the authors&apos;
interest, the research article and its components
(sections, figures, tables, etc.), the problem un-
der consideration, the authors&apos; solution, others&apos;
solution, the topics of the research article, the
motivation for the study, the importance of the
study, what the author found, what the author
think, what others have done, and so forth.
Those concepts are systematically selected for
inclusion in professional abstracts. We have
noted that some of them are lexically marked
while others appear as arguments of predicates
conveying specific relations in the domain of
discourse. For example, in an expression such
as &amp;quot;We found significant reductions in ...&amp;quot; the
verb &amp;quot;find&amp;quot; takes as an argument a result and
in the expression &amp;quot;The lack of a library severely
limits the impact of...&amp;quot; the verb &amp;quot;limit&amp;quot; entails
a problem.
We have used our corpus and a set of more
than 50 complete technical articles in order
to deduce a conceptual model and to gather
lexical information conveying concepts and
relations. Although our conceptual model does
not deal with all the intricacies of the domain,
we believe it covers most of the important in-
formation relevant for an abstract. In order to
obtain linguistic expressions marking concepts
and relation, we have tagged our corpus with
a POS tagger (Foster, 1991) and we have used
a thesaurus (Vianna, 1980) to semantically
classify the lexical items (most of them are
polysemous). Figure 2, gives an overview of
some concepts, relations and lexical items so
fax identified.
The information we collected allow the defini-
tion of patterns of two kinds: (i) linguistic pat-
terns for the identification of noun groups and
verb groups; and (ii) domain specific patterns
for the identification of entities and relations
in the conceptual model. This allows for the
identification of complex noun groups such as
&amp;quot;The TIGER condition monitoring system&amp;quot; in
the sentence &amp;quot;The TIGER gas turbine condition
monitoring system addresses the performance
monitoring aspects&amp;quot; and the interpretation of
strings such as &amp;quot;University of Montréal&amp;quot; as a
reference to an institution and verb forms such
as &amp;quot;have presented&amp;quot; as a reference to a predi-
cate possibly introducing the topic of the docu-
ment. The patterns have been specified accord-
ing to the linguistic constructions found in the
corpus and then expanded to cope with other
valid linguistic patterns, though not observed
in our data.

4 Generating Abstracts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996635625">
It is generally accepted that there is no such
thing as an ideal abstract, but different kinds of
abstracts for different purposes and tasks (McK-
eown et al., 1998). We aim at the generation
of a type of abstract well recognized in the lit-
erature: short indicative-informative abstracts.
The indicative part identifies the topics of the
document (what the authors present, discuss,
address, etc.) while the informative part elabo-
rates some topics according to the reader&apos;s inter-
est by motivating the topics, describing entities,
defining concepts and so on. This kind of ab-
stract could be used in tasks such as accessing
the content of the document and deciding if the
parent document is worth reading. Our method
of automatic abstracting relies on:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991914375">
• the identification of sentences containing
domain specific linguistic patterns;
• the instantiation of templates using the se-
lected sentences;
• the identification of the topics of the docu-
ment and;
• the presentation of the information using
re-generation techniques.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983451612903">
The templates represent different kinds of
information we have identified as important for
inclusion in an abstract. They are classified in:
indicative templates used to represent con-
cepts and relations usually present in indicative
abstracts such as &amp;quot;the topic of the document&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;the structure of the document&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the identifi-
cation of main entities&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the problem&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the
need for research&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the identification of the
solution&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the development of the author&amp;quot;
and so on; and informative templates rep-
resenting concepts that appear in informative
abstracts such as &amp;quot;entity/concept definition&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;entity/concept description&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;entity/concept
relevance&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;entity/concept function&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the
motivation for the work&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the description
of the experiments&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the description of the
methodology&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the results&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the main con-
clusions&amp;quot; and so on. Associated with each
template is a set of rules used to identify
potential sentences which could be used to
instantiate the template. For example, the
rules for the topic of the document template,
specify to search the category make know in the
introduction and conclusion of the paper while
the rules for the entity description specify the
search for the describe category in all the text.
Only sentences matching specific patterns are
retained in order to instantiate the templates
and this reduces in part the problem of poly-
semy of the lexical items.

The overall process of automatic abstracting
shown in Figure 3 is composed of the following
steps:
Pre-processing and Interpretation:
The raw text is tagged and transformed in a
structured representation allowing the following
processes to access the structure of the text
(words, groups of words, titles, sentences,
paragraphs, sections, and so on). Domain
specific transducers are applied in order to
identify possible concepts in the discourse
domain (such as the authors, the paper, ref-
erences to other authors, institutions and so
on) and linguistic transducers are applied in
order to identify noun groups and verb groups.
Afterwards, semantic tags marking discourse
domain relations and concepts are added to the
different elements of the structure.
Additionally, the process extracts noun groups,
computes noun group distribution (assigning
a weight to each noun group) and generates
the topical structure of the paper: a structure
with n + 1 components where n is the number
of sections in the document. Component i
(0 &lt;i &lt; n) contains the noun groups extracted
from the title of section i (0 indicates the title of
the document). The structure is used in the se-
lection of the content for the indicative abstract.
Indicative Selection: Its function is to
identify potential topics of the document and to
construct a pool of &amp;quot;propositions&amp;quot; introducing
the topics. The indicative templates are used
to this end: sentences are selected, filtered
and used to instantiate the templates using
patterns identified during the analysis of the
corpus. The instantiated templates obtained in
this step constitute the indicative data base.
Each template contains, in addition to their
specific slots, the following: the topic candidate
slot which is filled in with the noun groups of
the sentence used for instantiation, the weight
slot filled in with the sum of the weights of
the noun groups in the topic candidate slot
and, the position slot filled in with the position
of the sentence (section number and sentence
number) which instantiated the template. In
Figure 4, the &amp;quot;topic of the document&amp;quot; template
appears instantiated using the sentence &amp;quot;this
paper describes the Active Telepresence System
with an integrated AR system to enhance
the operator&apos;s sense of presence in hazardous
environments.&amp;quot;
In order to select the content for the indicative
abstract the system looks for a &amp;quot;match&amp;quot; be-
tween the topical structure and the templates
in the indicative data base: the system tries
all the matches between noun groups in the
topical structure and noun groups in the topic
candidate slots. One template is selected for
each component of the topical structure: the
template with more matches. The selected
templates constitute the content of the indica-
tive abstract and the noun groups in the topic
candidate slots constitute the potential topics.
Informative Selection: this process
aims to confirm which of the potential top-
ics computed by the indicative selection are
actual topics (i.e. topics the system could
informatively expand according to the reader
interest) and produces a pool of &amp;quot;proposi-
tions&amp;quot; elaborating the topics. All informative
templates are used in this step, the process
considers sentences containing the potential
topics and matching informative patterns. The
instantiated informative templates constitute
the informative data base and the potential
topics appearing in the informative templates
form the topics of the document.
Generation: This is a two step process.
First, in the indicative generation, the tem-
plates selected by the indicative selection are
presented to the reader in a short text which
contains the topics identified by the informative
selection and the kind of information the user
could ask for. Second, in the informative
generation, the reader selects some of the
topics asking for specific types of information.
The informative templates associated with the
selected topics are used to present the required
information to the reader using expansion
operators such as the &amp;quot;description&amp;quot; operator
whose effect is to present the description of the
selected topic. For example, if the &amp;quot;topic of
the document&amp;quot; template (Figure 4) is selected
by the informative selection the following
indicative text will be presented:

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997276">
In this paper, we have presented a new method
of automatic abstracting based on the re-
sults obtained from the study of a corpus
of professional abstracts and parent docu-
ments. In order to implement the model, we
rely on techniques in finite state processing,
instantiation of templates and re-generation
techniques. Paice and Jones (1993) have
already used templates representing specific
information in a restricted domain in order
to generate indicative abstracts. Instead, we
aim at the generation of indicative-informative
abstracts for domain independent texts. Radev
and McKeown (1998) also used instantiated
templates, but in order to produce summaries
of multiple documents. They focus on the
generation of the text while we are address-
ing the overall process of automatic abstracting.
We are testing our method using long tech-
nical articles found on the &amp;quot;Web.&amp;quot; Some out-
standing issues are: the problem of co-reference,
the problem of polysemy of the lexical items,
the re-generation techniques and the evaluation
of the methodology which will be based on the
judgment of readers.

We have used our corpus and a set of more than 50 complete technical articles in order to deduce a conceptual model and to gather lexical information conveying concepts and relations. Although our conceptual model does not deal with all the intricacies of the domain, we believe it covers most of the important information relevant for an abstract. In order to obtain linguistic expressions marking concepts and relation, we have tagged our corpus with a POS tagger (Foster, 1991) and we have used a thesaurus (Vianna, 1980) to semantically classify the lexical items (most of them are polysemous). Figure 2, gives an overview of some concepts, relations and lexical items so fax identified. The information we collected allow the definition of patterns of two kinds: (i) linguistic patterns for the identification of noun groups and verb groups; and (ii) domain specific patterns for the identification of entities and relations in the conceptual model. This allows for the identification of complex noun groups such as &amp;quot;The TIGER condition monitoring system&amp;quot; in the sentence &amp;quot;Th</context>

Figure 2: Some Conceptual and Linguistic Information 4 Generating Abstracts It is generally accepted that there is no such thing as an ideal abstract, but different kinds of abstracts for different purposes and tasks (McKeown et al., 1998). We aim at the generation of a type of abstract well recognized in the literature: short indicative-informative abstracts. The indicative part identifies the topics of the document (what the authors present, discuss, address, etc.) while the informative part elaborates some topics according to the reader&apos;s interest by motivating the topics, describing entities, defining concepts and so on. This kind of abstract could be used in tasks such as accessing the content of the document and deciding if the parent document is worth reading.
