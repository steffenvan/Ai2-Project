While various aspects of syntactic structure have
been shown to bear on the determination of phrase-
level prosody, the text-to-speech field has lacked a
robust working system to test the possible relations
between syntax and prosody. We describe an
implemented system which uses the deterministic
parser Fidditch to create the input for a set of prosody
rules. The prosody rules generate a prosody tree that
specifies the location and relative strength of prosodic
phrase boundaries. These specifications are converted
to annotations for the Bell Labs text-to-speech system
that dictate modulations in pitch and duration for the
input sentence.
We discuss the results of an experiment to determine
the performance of our system. We are encouraged
by an initial 5 percent error rate and we see the design
of the parser and the modularity of the system
allowing changes that will upgrade this rate.

INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.998810986666667">
We describe an experimental text-to-speech system
that uses a deterministic parser and prosody rules to
generate phrase-level pitch and duration information
for English input. This information is used to
annotate the input sentence. which is then processed
by the text-to-speech programs currently under
development at Bell Labs. In constructing the ,svstem,
our goal has been to test the hypotheses (i) that
information available in the syntax tree. in particular.
grammatical functions such as subject-predicate and
head-complement. is by itself useful in determining
prosodic phrasing for synthetic speech. and (ii) that it
is possible to use a syntactic parser that specifies
grammatical functions to determine prosodic phrasing
for synthetic speech.
Although certain connections between syntax and
prosody are well-known (e.g. the influence of part of
speech on stress in words like progress. or the setting
off of parenthetical expressions) very little practical
knowledge is available on which aspects of syntax
might be connected to prosodic phrasing. In many
studies, investigators have sought connections between
constituent structure and prosody (e.g. Cooper and
Paccia-Cooper 1980. Umeda 1982. Gee and Grosjean
1983) but, with the exception of Selkirk (1984). they
tend to neglect the representation of grammatical
functions in the syntax tree. Moreover, previous work
has not been specific enough to provide the basis for a
full system implementation. Based on our study of
prosodic phrasing in recorded human speech. we
decided to emphasize three aspects of structure that
relate to phrasing: syntactic constituency, grammatical
function, and constituent length. These findings.
which we will discuss in detail, have been
implemented as a collection of prosody rules in an
experimental text-to-speech system.
Two important features characterize our system.
First, the input to our prosody system is a parse tree
generated by a version of the deterministic parser
Fidditch (Hindle 1983). The left-corner search
strategy of this parser and, in particular, its
determinism. give Fidditch the speed that makes
online text-to-speech production feasible.&apos; In building
a parse tree, Fidditch identifies the core subject-verb-
object relations but makes no attempt to represent
adjunct or modifier relations. Thus relative clauses.
adverbials, and other non-argument constituents have
no specified position in the tree and no specified
semantic role. Second. the rules in the prosody system
build a prosody tree by referring both to the syntactic
structure and to earlier stages of prosodic structure.
The result is a hierarchical representation that
supports the view, also proposed in Selkirk (1984).
that grammatical function information is related to
prosodic phrasing, but indirectly, through different
levels of processing.
Informal tests of the system show that it is capable
of producing a significant improvement in the
prosodic quality of the resulting synthesized speech.
Our investigations of the system&apos;s problems. which we
describe, have not revealed any serious
counterexample to our basic approach. In many cases.
it appears that problems with the current version can
be resolved by taking our approach a step further, and
including lexical information required by the parser as
another factor in the determination of prosodic
phrasing.
TEXT-TO-SPEECH
Most text-to-speech systems comprise two
components: pronunciation rules and a speech
synthesizer. Pronunciation rules convert the input text
into a phonetic transcription; this information may
also be supplemented by a dictionary that provides
information about the part of speech. stress pattern,
and phonetic makeup of particular words. The speech

i. With a grammar of about 600 rules and a lexicon of about 2400
words, Fidditch parses the 25 sample sentences of Robinson
(1982). averaging 7 words per sentence and chosen for their
structural diversity, at an average rate of .405 seconds per
sentence on a Symbolics 3670. The rate is approximately
proportional to the number of words in a sentence.

synthesizer then converts this phonetic transcription
into a series of speech parameters which are
subsequently processed to produce digitized speech.
While these systems tend to perform quite well on
word pronunciation, they fall short when it comes to
providing good prosody for complete sentences.
Current text-to-speech systems have no access to the
syntactic and semantic properties of a sentence that
influence phrase-level prosody. Hence rules for
sentence prosody, when they are provided at all
typically depend on superficial aspects of text (e.g.
punctuation) and on heuristics that vary widely in
sophistication. Although such techniques often add a
more natural quality to the resulting synthetic speech,
they can fail in important ways, for example. by
ignoring the prosodic event between a lengthy subject
and a predicate, so that there is no clear prosodic
boundary between right and mark, in The characters on
the right mark the salient features.-
Several authors (e.g. Allen 1976; Elovitz et al.
1976; Luce et al. 1983) have suggested that prosodic
differences between synthetic and natural speech are
the primary, unaddressed factor leading to difficulties
in the comprehension of fluent synthetic speech. The
relation between phrase-level prosody and its sources,
however, is so poorly understood that we have no
good sense of the degree to which different levels of
explanation--syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic--are
applicable. We currently have reasonable tools for
automatic syntactic analysis of a text, but there is
nothing equivalently well-developed for semantic or
pragmatic textual analysis. Thus an obvious goal is to
explore the extent to which phrase-level prosody can
be explained by the syntax tree and develop a detailed
description of that relation. A further goal is to
convert the resulting insights about this relation into a
system that can work with a speech synthesizer. This
allows us to test our description more adequately and
perhaps also produce something that will further text-
to-speech technology.

SYNTACTIC STRUCTURE AND
PROSODIC PHRASING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995462419354839">
Certain relations between syntax and prosody,
especially at the word level, are well-known. For
example, the syntactic category of a word may affect
its phonetic realization, as in the verb/adjective
distinction of separate, approximate, and the verb/noun
distinction of house, wind, lives. Likewise, syntactic
category affects word stress, so that verbs such as
progress, insert, object, and rebel receive final stress,
whereas the corresponding nouns receive penultimate
stress.
Beyond the word level, however, there has been
little investigation of systematic connections between
syntactic structure and prosodic phrasing. The
psycholinguistic and acoustic investigations of Cooper
and Paccia-Cooper (1980), Umeda (1982) and Gee and
Grosjean (1983) and the prosodic theory of Selkirk
(1984) are among the more notable studies and
represent the two main approaches to syntax/prosody
2. Note that without a syntactic analysis that correctly identifies
grammatical functions, it is impossible to determine whether
the word mark is a noun ending the subject phrase or the verb
of the predicate phrase. Simple &apos;surface&apos; parsers, such as that
described in Umeda and Teranishi (1974). will still fail to
identify the prosodic boundary correctly.
relations. In Cooper and Paccia-Cooper (1980) and
Umeda (1982), the connection from syntax to prosodic
phrasing is unmediated by any filtering process, i.e.,
they propose that the details of prosodic phrasing can
be determined directly from syntactic structure by
associating particular syntactic nodes (or constituent
boundaries) with a phonetic value, either pausing,
segmental lengthening, or the blocking of the cross-
word conditioning of phonological rules. By contrast,
Gee and Grosjean (1983) and Selkirk (1984) believe
that the syntax-prosody relation is indirect: prosodic
phrasing is derived by rules that refer to left-to-right
ordering, length (or branching patterns), and, in the
case of Selkirk. grammatical function, as well as
constituent membership in order to infer a
hierarchical prosodic structure. But while their
respective positions are quite clear, none of these
studies is conclusive. All lack a syntactic framework
sufficiently detailed and formalized to allow extensive
testing, and most consider pnly a small number of
sentences and sentence types.&apos;
To develop our analysis, we first examined
prosodic phrasing in the speech of one of us reading
prose from various texts, including four instruction
manuals. These texts were later augmented by a
professional reading of a prose story. The boundaries
between prosodic phrases were identified and then
classed according to their syntactic context and
semantic function.
Our results, which are outlined below, indicate an
organization of the prosodic phrases that supports the
&apos;indirect relationship&apos; approach of Gee and Grosjean
(1983) and Selkirk (1984). We found that, in our
corpus, prosodic phrasing depends on three aspects of
structure: the breakdown into syntactic constituents,
the grammatical function of a constituent, and
constituent length. Let us review each of these
factors.

The possible constituents recognized by our parser
are Noun Phrase (NP), Verb Phrase (VP). Adjective

Prepositional Phrase (PP). In general, we found that
syntactic constituency is particularly important for
predicting points at which a prosodic phrase boundary
is not produced, i.e., the words within a syntactic
constituent cohere. For example, the italicized
phrases in (1)-(5) had no perceptible boundaries at the

adverbs, the modifier can be a comparative).
We observed a hierarchy among these relations
with respect to the strength, or perceptibility, of a
prosodic boundary, with the boundary between
sentence and adjunct receiving the highest potential
boundary strength, followed by the subject-predicate
boundary, then the head-complement and head-
modifier boundaries. Thus in (6), there is a strong
boundary between subject and predicate, whereas in
(7), due to the strong boundary between adjunct and

diminishes. (Dashes indicate the location of the

While we may view each boundary as having an
intrinsic strength based on constituency and
grammatical function, the determination of actual
strengths appears to depend on the interaction of the
intrinsic strength of a boundary with the strengths of
other boundaries in the sentence. as well as the
distance between these boundaries. The most salient
of the interactions we observed was between the
placement of a boundary at the subject-predicate
junction and the placement of a boundary following
the verb-complement junction. The mediating factor
in this interaction was the relative length of the
subject with respect to the length of the verb&apos;s

AN EXPERIMENTAL PROSODY SYSTEM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9959435">
Our findings confirmed that syntactic structure
plays a major role in determining prosodic structure,
but the relationship is indirect--the exact influence of
syntactic constituency varies according to the length
and grammatical function of each constituent. To
refine and test this idea, we implemented an
experimental text-to-speech system in which rules
apply to a parse tree to infer prosodic structure and
then annotate the input string with phrasing
information derived from the prosodic structure; this
annotated input string is submitted to the Bell Labs
text-to-speech programs. which convert it into a
speech file. Our system comprises three components:
a parser that builds syntactic structure, rules that
derive prosody information from the syntactic
structure, and the Bell Labs text-to-speech programs.
The parser and speech programs are independent
components. The prosody rules act as a filter between
them, converting the syntactic information generated
by the parser into prosodic information that can be
supplied to the text-to-speech programs.
Parsing.
Our parser is a version of Fidditch (Hindle 1983). a
moderate coverage parser based on the deterministic
model described in Marcus (1980). To build syntactic
structure, Fidditch uses a grammar that requires the
representations produced by lexical and syntactic rules
to be consistent with the (semantic) predicate-
argument structure. The surface syntactic structures
generated by the parser represent the argument
structure of a phrase or sentence, i.e. the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot;
constituents of a sentence (its subject (NP), modality
(AUX), and predicate (VP)) and the complements of
phrasal heads. The structure is determined, for the
most part, by rules that refer to argument information
that is specified in the lexicon for the content words
(nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs), and by rules that
insert null terminals such as the &amp;quot;trace&amp;quot; of wh-
movement. In general, the grammar is consistent with
the government and binding framework of Chomsky
(1981), as adapted to the needs of a parser.
The input to the parser is a phrase or sentence
(punctuation is optional). Its output is a surface
structure tree in which the status of a constituent with
respect to the predicate-argument structure of the
sentence is indicated by the constituent&apos;s attachment
to higher nodes in the tree. Thus only constituents
that belong to the core are attached to the S node, and
only complements of a phrasal head can become
righthand sisters of the head. Adjuncts and modifiers.

whose role depends on semantic and pragmatic
information about the discourse domain, have no
assigned position within a structure and so are
represented as &amp;quot;orphan&amp;quot; nodes in the tree.
For example, Figure 1 shows the parse tree for
Left-hand power unit on each shelf in 48-channel module
can power only the echo cancelers that are in that shelf.
4 The structure in Figure 1 contains a single core
sentence -- unit can power the cancelers -- with left-
branching modifiers -- left-hand, power, and echo. The
sentence also contains three modifiers -- the PPs on
each shelf and in 48-channel module, and the adverb
only -- which are unattached constituents. This is the
significance of the unlabeled node dominating each of
these constituents. The PPs are not attached because
unit is not lexically marked to take a PP headed •by on
or in as a complement. and shelf is not lexically
marked to take a PP complement headed by in. Nor is
any constituent lexically marked to accept only as an
argument.
Figure 1 also contains a relative clause, that are in
that shelf. In the relative clause. T is a null terminal
that stands for the trace of the relativized subject NP;
the * in tense stands for a null Aux element. Because
nouns do not select relative clauses as arguments (any
noun can be relativized). the parser does not identify
the relations of the modifier constituent to the
elements of the core sentence. Hence the relative
clause is not attached to any other syntactic node in
the tree.
Text-to-speech Synthesis.
The programs that make up the speech component
are described in Liberman and Buchsbaum (personal
communication). These programs take English text as
input and produce digitized speech output. By
annotating the input text to this system, many aspects
of its operation can be overridden or modified: e.g. the
location of major and minor phrase boundaries, the
stress given to words, the transcription of words and
the boundaries between them, the timing of segments,
and details of the pitch contour. As we will show,
with our prosody system we are able to produce
strings in which four boundary levels are identified
and perceptually distinguished, using the current text-
to-speech system annotations.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.892518">
Prosodic Phrasing.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999407826086957">
The prosody rules use information about
constituent structure, grammatical role, and length to
map a surface structure such as that in Figure 1 onto a
prosody tree such as that in Figure 2. The prosody
tree identifies the location of phrase boundaries
(signified by the eD nodes) and the relative strength of
each boundary (signified by a number in the eD node).
It is this information that is used to annotate the input
text with escape sequences that provide the text-to-
speech system with instructions about prosodic
phrasing.
In formulating our rules for building the prosodic
structure, we began with the idea of simply
implementing the model of Gee and Grosjean (1983).
This model, initially proposed to predict a form of
psychological data describing subjective sentence
structure known as performance structure, determines
prosodic boundaries from a syntactic tree, but assumes
rather than explicitly presents a syntactic component.
We were initially attracted to the Gee and Grosjean
model because of its emphasis on relative boundary
weighting. i.e., on the determination of the strength of
a given boundary with respect to the other boundaries
in the sentence. We found that in the data we had
collected, this weighting played an important role. In
fact, we incorporated directly into our system one
method of doing this weighting, namely Gee and
Grosjean&apos;s rule to determine the strengths of the
prosodic phrase boundaries around a verb using
relative length (as measured by terminal node count).
As we extended Gee and Grosjean&apos;s model to
create an algorithm adequate for use in a general
purpose system, our algorithm diverged from its
starting point, reflecting our attempts to correct
weaknesses and lacunae that we encountered in the
Gee and Grosjean model. That we encountered these
problems is not surprising given the difference
between our goals and those of Gee and Grosjean.
The most important difference between the Gee
and Grosjean model and our current algorithm
involves the factors determining boundary weight.
Gee and Grosjean assume that this weighting is
dependent only on the number of syntactic nodes,
their left-to-right ordering and, in the case of the verb
phrase. on constituent length. In contrast, our data, in
agreement with Selkirk&apos;s (1984) theoretical analysis,
indicated that boundary strength is dependent on the
grammatical functions that the constituents in a given
sentence play. In particular, we observed a hierarchy
among these functions with respect to boundary
strength. as discussed below.5
In addition to incorporating grammatical function
information into our system, we fleshed out the model
of Gee and Grosjean to deal with syntactic structures
that they do not explicitly consider. In particular, Gee
and Grosjean&apos;s strictly left-to-right building of the
5. As an example of the effect that grammatical functions have
on prosodic phrasing, consider the sentence Finally the strange
young man left. We view this sentence as consisting of two
grammatical relations: subject-predicate and adjunct-sentence.
In our hierarchy of grammatical relations, the boundary
between the adjunct and the sentence is more salient than the
boundary between the subject and the predicate. The system
reflects this by assigning a stronger boundary following Finally
than following man.
If we exclude any effects of grammatical functions and
assume a simple felt-to-right attachment of the three
constituents Finally, the strange VOling man and left, to the
prosody tree, we would assign a stronger boundary following
man than following Final/v. It is not clear that Gee and
Grosjean make this left-to-right assumption in such examples.
They view adverbial phrases -like Fiardly- as dominated by the
complementizer node in the syntax tree, and it is difficult to
&apos;determine whether they integrate the material in the
complementizer with the material in the core sentence as they
are analyzing the material in the core sentence or after that
analysis is completed. If they integrate the complementizer
with the core sentence, then they assume that Ftnai/v bundles
with the sentence in a left-to-right manner and predict,
incorrectly, that the stronger boundary occurs after mom If
they complete the prosodic analysis of the core sentence
before bundling the sentence with the complementizer, then
they incorrectly predict that there is a strong boundary after
wh- phrases in the complementizer. In particular, they would
incorrectly predict that in sentences like At the outset what
problems did you expect the most perceptible boundary would
be after problems.
Furthermore, assuming that an adjunct in sentence-initial
position is dominated by the complementizer node and in
sentence-final position by S-bar creates an inconsistent
description, which hampers the y alue of the model as an
experimental tool.

prosodic tree left certain questions open. For
example, their model does not deal with sentences
embedded in the middle of a main sentence (as-in The
notion [that he would refrain from such an act] was
incorrect.) We incorporate embedded sentences into
the prosodic tree in a cyclic manner to insure that the
material in the embedded sentence is processed before
that in the main sentence.6 In addition. Gee and
Grosjean leave open the treatment of the multiple
rightward embedding of non-sentential constituents,
e.g., the NP embedding in The destruction of the good
name of his father. Our approach is to handle these
cases recursively, from the most deeply embedded
phrase up, in order to preserve the prosodic cohesion
of the entire NP.
Our adjunction rules are derived for the most part
from Selkirk&apos;s account. We have also made use of the
idea, which Gee and Grosjean (1983) take largely from
the work of Selkirk. that certain syntactic heads mark
off phonological phrase boundaries, and provide the
basic prosodic constituents for higher level analysis.
Our prosody rules run in four independent stages.
Each stage builds on the previous stage, so that the
rules can refer to both syntactic and prosodic structure
as they build successively higher levels of prosodic
structure.
(i) Adjunction Rules combine orthographically
distinct words into phonological constituents with no
internal word boundary. They join a word to its left
or right neighbor depending on (a) the category of the
word, and (b) its structural relation to other words. In
general, adjoinable words are the function words--
articles, complementizers, auxiliary verbs,
conjunctions, prepositions and pronouns (except for
the &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; possessives, mine, hers, theirs, yours, Ours,
which are treated as regular NP&apos;s).
Adjunction occurs six times for the sentence in
Figure 2 to create six multiple word groups, all right-
adjoining: on each, in 48-channel, can power, the echo,
that are and in that. These groups of adjoined words
appear as terminals in the prosody tree in Figure 2. In
subsequent processing the boundaries between the
words in these groups are marked so that the text-to-
speech system does not produce theprosodic
indications of a word boundary. In addition, these
groups are treated as single words in further analyses.
(ii) 0-phrasing Rules construct phonological (or (1))
phrases, which are the building blocks of the prosody
tree. These rules identify groups of words that cohere
strongly in speech and thus should not be separated by
phrase boundaries. In the present implementation,
each cri phrase is constructed by a left-to-right process
that collects the words formed by adjunction until it
reaches a noun or verb. At this point, a cla phrase is
created that consists of the collected words plus the
noun or verb, which acts as head of the phrase. For
example, in that shelf, in Figure 2. is a single 43 phrase
consisting of two words.
In Figure 2, the 43 nodes marked with a syntactic
category are the minimal phonological constituents
with respect to later rules that build the prosodic

phrases; these (1) phrases have an internal structure,
but the structure plays no role in further processing.
Note that neither adjectives nor adverbs are allowed
to be the head of a (13 phrase. so that three additional
open slots is a single c1) phrase consisting of four words.
Examples such as Someone tall walked into the room,
however, suggest that our treatment of these
categories is not detailed enough and that, in future
versions of the system. some adjectives and adverbs
should act as 43 heads.
(iii) Prosody-phrasing rules use information about cl)
phrases and syntactic structure to create a new
organization of the sentence and to assign strength
values to the boundaries between successive 4) phrases.
The process of building the prosody tree starts with
the sentence node (S or Sbar) that is most deeply
embedded in the utterance. transforming it into a
prosody subtree. This process continues through
successively higher levels of sentence nodes until all
top-level sentences have been transformed into
prosody subtrees. All the processing of each
successive sentence is done before the relation of the
sentences to each other is considered?
Within a sentence, the (1) phrases are processed
from left to right. This stage of the analysis uses a
window that allows access to three adjacent nodes.
Pattern-action rules, which are described below, apply
to the nodes in the window and build prosody subtrees
that replace the syntax nodes. These subtrees are
headed by a 4&gt; node containing a number that
represents node count; the number is determined by
counting the number of nodes contained in the
prosody subtree, plus 1 for the cID node that heads the
subtree.8 In general, the prosody phrase rules do three
things:
(a) Balance prosodic phrases by referring to
constituent length. This rule only applies for building
the prosody subtree that contains the verb. If the
node count for subject plus verb is less than the node
count of the verb&apos;s complement. then subject and verb
are grouped together in a prosodic subtree; this gives
the phrasing in The characters on the right -- mark the
salient features. Otherwise, the verb is grouped with
its complement in a prosodic subtree; an example of
this grouping is the subtree for can power only the echo
cancelers in Figure 2.
(b) Combine the cri phrase daughters of the major
constituents, excluding VP. into a prosodic subtree.
At present, this rule only applies to NP and PP since
adjectives and adverbs are currently not treated as cl)
heads. For example. the name of the character, which
forms two (1) phrases under NP (the name and of the
character), become a single prosody phrase that
replaces the NP.
7. We have found at least one class of phrases for which this
order of processing appears inappropriate. In these, the head
of the top-level phrase is epistemic -- e.g., believe, know, belief.
knowledge -- and its complement is a sentence. In most case.s,
the current processing order for embedded sentences will
produce a break between a head and a following embedded
sentence. For this class of sentences, however, the break does
not seem to be appropriate. While it would be straightforward
to handle this as an exception, we are currently examining
whether there is a more principled way to describe what must
be done in these cases.
s Only the top-level .1) nodes, those which contain the head of
the syntactic phrase, are counted in computing the node count„
Thus, for example, in Figure 2, the sub-phrasal branching of
Left-hand and power unit does not contribute to the node count.

(c) Bundle together prosodic constituents ((I)
phrases) from left to right if no other rules apply.
This rule integrates the constituents left unattached by
the parser into the prosodic structure. It accounts for
the prosodic structure of left-hand power unit on each
shelf in 48-channel module in figure 2, which is formed
by first bundling left-hand power unit with on each
shelf, into (L)-3, and then bundling the result with in
48-channel module into (1)-5. The final application of
bundling replaces the Sigma node with the top level
prosody node, which is (D-13 in Figure 2.
(iv) Prosody conversion rules map the boundary
strength indices onto three phonological mechanisms.
Boundary indices in the low range, e.g. the cI)-3 nodes
in Figure 2. are realized as a phrase accent
(Pierrehumbert 1980). Mid-range indices such as
and (1)-9 in Figure 2 are realized as changes in pitch
range. High indices are realized with modulations in
both pitch range and duration. Thus the hierarchical
organization of a structure such as that in Figure 2 can
be reflected directly in the synthesized speech.

Others involve phenomena that characterize spoken
English, and thus did not occur in our original corpus

To date, our system has been tested systematically
on a set of 39 sentences. and its performance has been
observed less formally on a set of approximately 300
sentences.9 The test corpus covers a repair manual for
telephone switching systems and an introductory
description of the Prose 2000 text-to-speech system.

We have observed problems, however, especially in
the formal test corpus, much of which we chose for its
potential difficulty. Of the 39 test sentences, 38
parsed correctly. Of these, the prosodic component
returned 26 sentences with a complete set of
acceptable prosody markings. In terms of actual
markings, the system marked 393 prosodic events, of
which 21 markings were unacceptable. We can
attribute errors in those sentences with unacceptable
prosodic markings to three distinct problems discussed
below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.968251">
Complement Sentences.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999362666666667">
Five of the errors that arose from the prosody
system&apos;s treatment of the test corpus result from the
fact that the system sets off all subordinate sentences,
including complement sentences. from the main
sentence. Informal testing of the productions of four
informants on the relevant data indicated that this
approach works correctly for complement sentences
such as (13)-(16). (Complement sentences are
italicized):

Cases like (17)-(19). in which no break is perceived
between the verb and its complement sentence, form a
syntactically distinct class in Fidditch. This class is
characterized by the fact that the verbal head in each
case is one that does not require that its complement

or a wh- word). The class includes epistemic verbs.

Sentence-Final Constituents.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999274222222222">
Fifteen of the errors that arose from the system&apos;s
treatment of the test corpus result from a high
boundary value that sets final constituents off from
the main sentence. The high value is due to the
system&apos;s purely left-to-right attachment of syntactically
unattached constituents (see rule iii.d above). The
high boundary value is acceptable in sentences like
(27)-(29). (The relevant final constituents in these
examples are italicized).

In many cases it appears that the grammatical
relation of the final constituent to the rest of the
sentence determines the boundary value that sets off
this constituent. In particular. sentence adjuncts.
which bear no relation to any single item in a
sentence, are set off by a minor phrase boundary.
whereas final constituents that modify a particular
item are less perceptibly set off. This is the
distinction between the final constituents in (27)-(29).
which are adjuncts. and those in (30)-(32). which are
modifiers. However, while the distinction between the
grammatical relations of the core sentence
(complement and subject) and those of the periphery
(adjunct and modifier) is fairly straightforward. and
handled directly by the mechanisms of the Fidditch
parser, the distinctions between the peripheral
elements of adjunct and modifier are complex and
require the addition of costly mechanisms.
The cost of adding adjunct/modifier distinctions is
illustrated by the ambiguity that arises when both
adjunct and modifier readings are possible. For
example, on one reading of (31), naturally modifies the
verb speak; i.e., the informants were to speak in a
natural manner. On the other reading. naturally is an
adjunct equivalent to of course. (To see this meaning
more clearly, consider the rearrangement of this
sentence with the adjunct at the beginning: Naturally,
they instructed the informants to speak.) The context of
speech analysis prefers the former reading. However.
the net benefit of adding sophisticated contextual
analysis to our system. if attainable, is, at best.
unclear. The same may be said of adding selectional
restrictions, or detailed information on logical form.
In contrast, a finer treatment of local syntactic
constraints on boundary values preceding final
constituents is within reach. From the data we have
examined, it appears that the character of the prosodic
event before the final constituent can be locally
determined to a great extent. For the most part. this
determination depends on the category type of the
final constituent and on the contents of the leading
edge of the constituent. For example. interjections
(however, moreover, therefore, alas, thus, of course, etc.)
and sentence adverbs (apparently, generally, luckily
etc.) are uniformly set off by a high boundary value
and should remain so. In contrast. the boundary value
of final prepositional phrases. particularly those with
a monosyllabic preposition (in, on, at, to, with, for) as
the left edge of the phrase, should be reduced.11 We
are currently engaged in categorizing the constituent
types and left-edge items that characterize final
constituents with respect to the prosodic event that
precedes them.
Alternatively, we are considering the play-it-safe
approach of reducing the high boundary values that
set off final constituents to mid-boundary values.
Currently these values are converted to a
downstepping feature. This approach may also be
useful in conjunction with our local determination
approach for those constituents whose status is either
undecidable or ambiguous under the latter approach.L
11. In this view, expressions such as in principle, in general. in
particular, in consideration of etc. must be treated like
interjections.
12. Reducing the final boundary v alue leaves ambiguities
unresolved. For sentences such as (i) and (ii), below, we
believe this lack of resolution is appropriate:
(i) John saw a girl in the park with a telescope.
[The telescope is with John or the girl. or its in the
park.]
(ii) I need a woman to fix the sink.
[I need a woman so that I can fix the sink.
I need a woman who can fix the sink.]
Our view, following Marcus and Hindle (p.c.) is that in normal,
spoken English, such ambiguities are not processed unless the
speaker or listener is directly questioned regarding the
ambiguity. Likewise the prosodic events that might
disambiguate are inappropriate unless such questioning occurs.
Other cases are less clear. For example. it is difficult to
imagine that, in (28) the difference between the reading of the
ly/zich clause as a sentence adjunct and as a noun phrase
modifier on boundaries is not processed. We would hope that in
such cases some local distinction. such as the presence or
absence of the comma in (28). obtains.

When a sentence contains both sentence-initial and
sentence-final adjuncts, the sentence-initial adjuncts
will be less prominently set off than the sentence-final
adjuncts due to the left-to-right attachment of adjuncts

(33), however, a more appropriate rendering would
have the boundary after the adjunct On a clear day be

While it would be trivial to increase the value of
the pertinent boundary, we are as yet unsure what the

value after the prepositional phrase in (34) might be

<bodyText confidence="0.99997375">
While we have systematically tested our system so
far on a small set of examples. the number of prosodic
events involved in those examples, 393, is high. due to
the length of the sentences tested. We find the 5
percent error rate, representing 21 prosodic events,
encouraging at this stage in the development of the
system. In addition, we have delimited the problem
areas of an approach that relies solely on information
available in the syntax tree. Our initial investigation
of these problems indicates that at least part of the
necessary information about phrase-level prosody is
conveyed in the lexicon per se. Additionally, due to
the left-corner orientation of the Fidditch parser,
which exists independently to optimize search
strategies, the necessary lexical information is made
easily available.

CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996252888888889">
We have described an on-line experimental system
that uses prosody rules to infer prosodic phrasing from
constituent structure, grammatical functions, and
length considerations. The system contains three
modules: a deterministic parser, a set of prosodic
phrasing rules, and an algorithm to convert the output
of the prosodic phrasing rules into signals for the Bell
Labs text-to-speech system.
In developing the experiment, our intention was to
build a working system that would allow us to test
various hypotheses about the connections between
syntax and prosodic phrasing in human speech and to
upgrade the prosody of existing synthetic speech. The
modularity of our system enables us to alter each
module independently in order to test different
hypotheses. For example, the parser can be altered to
reflect the difference between verbs that require a
complementizer before a sentential complement and
those that do not.13 This alteration is independent of
13. Fidditch represents this as a difference in the level of the com-
plement sentence. Verbs that require a complementizer take
an S-bar complement, while verbs that do not require a com-
plementizer take an S complement with an optional that
preceding.
the workings of the prosody system or the prosody
conversion rules.
The existence of this prosody system makes the
problem areas in the syntax-prosody relation more
tractable by allowing online testing of a large body of
data. For example, the prosodically different
character of the two classes of complement sentences
discussed above became apparent after several
examples from each class were run through the
system. We therefore feel we have built a tool that
will aid in designing better approximations of sentence
prosody as it relates to syntactic structure.

Some of these omissions arise from the fact that we concentrated on sentence analysis rather than discourse analysis.

Contrastive stress is an example of prosodic phrasing based on discourse analysis. In our system&apos;s analysis. the phrase from India does not receive contrastive stress in (12).

However, while the distinction between the grammatical relations of the core sentence (complement and subject) and those of the periphery (adjunct and modifier) is fairly straightforward. and handled directly by the mechanisms of the Fidditch parser, the distinctions between the peripheral elements of adjunct and modifier are complex and require the addition of costly mechanisms. The cost of adding adjunct/modifier distinctions is illustrated by the ambiguity that arises when both adjunct and modifier readings are possible. For example, on one reading of (31), naturally modifies the verb speak; i.e., the informants were to speak in a natural manner. On the other reading. naturally is an adjunct equivalent to of course. (To see this meaning more clearly, consider the rearrangement of this sentence with the adjunct at the beginning: Naturally, they instructed the informants to speak.) The context of speech analysis prefers the former reading. However. the net benefit of adding sophisticated contextual analysis to our system. if attainable, is, at best. unclear. The same may be said of adding selectional restrictions, or detailed information on logic</context>

When a sentence contains both sentence-initial and sentence-final adjuncts, the sentence-initial adjuncts will be less prominently set off than the sentence-final adjuncts due to the left-to-right attachment of adjuncts to the prosodic tree (see rule iii.b above).

While we have systematically tested our system so far on a small set of examples. the number of prosodic events involved in those examples, 393, is high. due to the length of the sentences tested. We find the 5 percent error rate, representing 21 prosodic events, encouraging at this stage in the development of the system.

Five of the errors that arose from the prosody system&apos;s treatment of the test corpus result from the fact that the system sets off all subordinate sentences, including complement sentences. from the main sentence. Informal testing of the productions of four informants on the relevant data indicated that this approach works correctly for complement sentences such as (13)-(16). (Complement sentences are italicized): (13) Health services cautioned Western residents -- that they should ask where their watermelons come from before buying.

(16) Watermelon growers wonder -- whether this will continue throughout the rest of the season. However, the informant test consistently indicated that the complement sentences in (17)-(19) are not set off by a comparable boundary: (17) They believe California sales are still off 75 percent.
