A proper assessment of the relation between discourse structure and speaker&apos;s communicative inten-
tions requires a better understanding of communicative intentions. This contribution proposes that
there is a crucial difference between intending the hearer to entertain a certain belief (or desire, or
intention), and intending to affect the strength with which the hearer entertains the belief (or desire,
or intention). Rhetoric, if defined as a body of knowledge about how discourse structure affects the
strength with which a discourse participant entertains beliefs, desires, and intentions, can be seen
to play a precise and crucial role in the planning of discourse.

1 Communicative Intentions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.927333090909091">
It is commonly assumed that in engaging in communication, the speaker&apos; (S) has a specific com-
municative intention. Communicative intentions relate to that domain that the use of language can
affect, namely the mental state of the hearer (H), i.e., H&apos;s beliefs, desires, and intentions. Of course,
S may have other intentions that relate to the world at large (such as to get H to open a window),
but these are not properly speaking communicative intentions: they can only be achieved by use of
language if language first produces some appropriate change in H&apos;s mental states.
In discussing the ways in which S&apos;s use of language can affect H&apos;s mental states, it is important
to make a distinction between the fact that H is entertaining a belief, desire, or intention, and the
degree or strength with which it is entertained. This distinction has not always been made in the
text generation literature; presumably, this is because for the types of texts whose generation has
been studied, namely reports, documentation, and manuals of various kinds, this distinction is not
relevant. This is because these texts (weather reports, military reports, instruction manuals, and so
on) are &amp;quot;authoritative texts&amp;quot;: if the text makes H entertain a certain belief or intention, then H will
do so with a sufficient strength to satisfy S&apos;s communicative goals.
I claim that the interesting aspects of rhetorical relations (or &amp;quot;rhetoric&amp;quot; for short), and the intersting
role that rhetoric can play in discourse generation, have not been studied because the types of text
analyzed and generated have been one-sided in significant respects. For the sake of concreteness, let
us assume the following definition:

JE ll 90-16592; and Ben Franklin 915.3078C-1.
I I use the terminology from spoken language; these remarks apply equally well to written language.

<bodyText confidence="0.986989">
Rhetoric is S&apos;s knowledge of how text structure manipulates the strength of beliefs,
desires, and intentions already entertained by H.
In order to argue that this definition makes sense, I will discuss three questions: is rhetoric necessary,
is it trivial, and is it useful?
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.850677" genericHeader="method">
2 Is Rhetoric Necessary?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997128857142857">
More precisely, I will discuss whether S must necessarily have access to rhetoric in order to com-
municate effectively. S can only affect H&apos;s mental state through the use of a text (the sequence of
utterances which constitute an act of communication), which means that it is in the act of decoding
the text that H is affected. Thus S&apos;s goal is that H be affected by the text. In order to achieve this
goal, S must know about the process of decoding that 11 will use, otherwise S cannot purposefully use
language. Does text structure contribute to affecting H? Consider the following discourses (uttered
in a context where S knows that H does not like paying taxes under any circumstance).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998183">
(1) Vote for Bush. Clinton will raise taxes. Bush will not raise taxes.
(2) Clinton will raise taxes. Vote for Bush. Bush will not raise taxes.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.68379">
(2) is arguably less convincing than (1) since the the two sentences about the candidates&apos; attitude
towards taxation are not juxtaposed, thus depriving them of their contrastive force. Since text
structure participates in affecting H, then S must have knowledge about the mechanism; i.e., S must
have access to rhetoric.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.974762" genericHeader="method">
3 Is Rhetoric Trivial?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967392777777778">
It has often been observed that many of the definitions of rhetorical relations are tautologous.
Consider, for example, RST&apos;s definition of EVIDENCE [Mann and Thompson, 1987, p.10]. &apos;Nue&apos;
refers to the nucleus, that for which evidence is being contributed, and &apos;Sat&apos; refers to the satellite,
the evidence. Nuc and Sat are assumed to be juxtaposed.

The reader believes Sat or will find Sat credible.
H&apos;s comprehending Sat increases H&apos;s belief of Nuc
H&apos;s belief of Nuc is increased
The effect is a mere restatement of the constraint on the combination of Nuc and Sat — the definition
of the relation does not seem to be very informative. But consider a possible discourse relation
COUNTER-EVIDENCE:

H&apos;s comprehending Sat decreases H&apos;s belief of Nuc

The definition of COUNTER-EVIDENCE is entirely similar to (and as tautologous as) that of EV-
IDENCE, but it does not yield a coherent discourse. Consider the following, uttered in the same
context as (1) and (2) above:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.93638">
(3) Clinton will lower taxes. No democratic president has ever lowered taxes.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990412666666667">
There is no coherent reading for (3) under which S wants to decrease H&apos;s belief in the first sentence.
In order to achieve this effect, S needs to explicitly negate the first clause, which results in an
EVIDENCE relation.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9492">
(4) Clinton will not lower taxes. No democratic president has ever lowered taxes.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99599175">
Thus, the contribution of rhetoric lies in detailing what sort of effects (on H&apos;s beliefs, desire, and
intentions) mere juxtaposition can achieve. The fact that not all possible effects can be achieved
without explicit lexical and syntactic means is what makes rhetoric an important body of knowledge
in discourse processing.

4 Is Rhetoric Useful?

<bodyText confidence="0.926181666666667">
More specifically, can rhetoric be used in discourse planning? From what has been said, it would
follow that. rhetoric is essential in discourse planning, since without rhetoric, S would have no
knowledge of the effects of the discourse structure on H. But can rhetoric, as defined here, in fact
be used for discourse planning? Text planning architectures using knowledge about the relationship
between communicative intentions and the juxtaposition of discourse segments have been developed
at ISI [Hovy, 1988]. 1 conjecture that this type of architecture is well suited for planning texts (or
those aspects of texts) that manipulate the strength with which H entertains beliefs, desires, and
intentions. Such a planner would require a more sophisticated representation of mental states:
I. A logic of desire and a logic of intentions are required. The logic of desire would most likely
be a modal logic; the logic of intentions would, presumably, require a representation of action.
2. For beliefs, desires, and intentions, the strength with which they are entertained must also be
represented. Strength can be represented by discrete indications of quality, as has been done
by [Walker, 1993] in conversational models.
Ideal applications of such a planner would include texts whose primary goal is to increase H&apos;s desire
to perform a certain action, such as advertising texts of the types given above. Furthermore, dialog

<bodyText confidence="0.999924222222222">
planning is more likely to yield interesting instances of the use of rhetoric, since in monologic genres
the modeling of the strength of H&apos;s beliefs, desires, and intentions must remain conjectural, while in
dialogic genres, H&apos;s feedback can contribute to S&apos;s assessment of H&apos;s mental state.
Rhetoric is not useful for texts whose goal is mainly or exclusively to convey information, and for
which H is assumed to strongly believe any proposition the text makes H entertain. This is typically
the case for reports, including those generated by the original ISI planner. The use of a rhetoric-
based top-down planner for planning such texts cannot be successful [Kittredge et al., 1991], since
here the decomposition of the communicative goal must refer to the domain structure, and therefore
is too unconstrained to be handled by a domain-independent body of knowledge.

5 Types of Intentions, Types of Relations, Types of Texts

<bodyText confidence="0.999992083333333">
The distinction that has been made throughout this paper, between making II entertain a be-
lief, desire, or intention, and increasing the strength with which it is entertained, corresponds to
the one between intentional/presentational and informational/subject matter relations made by
[Mann and Thompson, 1987], and recently discussed by [Moore and Pollack, 1992]. Rhetoric relates
to the intentional level — note that the effect of RST&apos;s presentational relations are all formulated
in terms of increasing the strength of some aspect of H&apos;s mental state, while the subject matter
relations all have the effect of making H entertain (&amp;quot;recognize&amp;quot;) new beliefs. Texts that do not have
a meaningful intentional level, such as reports, cannot be planned using a rhetoric-based planner.
Texts that only have an intentional level of structure, such as (1) above, are ideally suited for such
planners. However, as Moore and Pollack argue, many texts simultaneously have both types of
structure. For such texts, new planning architectures must be found. They will require a better
understanding of communicative goals along the lines argued for in this paper.
