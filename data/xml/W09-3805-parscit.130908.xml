<bodyText confidence="0.999885076923077">
Empirical lower bounds studies in which
the frequency of alignment configurations
that cannot be induced by a particular for-
malism is estimated, have been important
for the development of syntax-based ma-
chine translation formalisms. The for-
malism that has received most attention
has been inversion transduction grammars
(ITGs) (Wu, 1997). All previous work
on the coverage of ITGs, however, con-
cerns parse failure rates (PFRs) or sen-
tence level coverage, which is not di-
rectly related to any of the evaluation mea-
sures used in machine translation. Søgaard
and Kuhn (2009) induce lower bounds on
translation unit error rates (TUERs) for a
number of formalisms, incl. normal form
ITGs, but not for the full class of ITGs.
Many of the alignment configurations that
cannot be induced by normal form ITGs
can be induced by unrestricted ITGs, how-
ever. This paper estimates the difference
and shows that the average reduction in
lower bounds on TUER is 2.48 in absolute
difference (16.01 in average parse failure
rate).

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999958153846154">
The first stage in training a machine translation
system is typically that of aligning bilingual text.
The quality of alignments is in that case of vi-
tal importance to the quality of the induced trans-
lation rules used by the system in subsequent
stages. In string-based statistical machine trans-
lation, the alignment space is typically restricted
by the n-grams considered in the underlying lan-
guage model, but in syntax-based machine trans-
lation the alignment space is restricted by very
different and less transparent structural contraints.
While it is easy to estimate the consequences of
restrictions to n-grams of limited size, it is less
trivial to estimate the consequences of the struc-
tural constraints imposed by syntax-based ma-
chine translation formalisms. Consequently, much
work has been devoted to this task (Wu, 1997;
Zens and Ney, 2003; Wellington et al., 2006;
Macken, 2007; Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009).
The task of estimating the consequences of
the structural constraints imposed by a particular
syntax-based formalism consists in finding what is
often called “empirical lower bounds” on the cov-
erage of the formalism (Wellington et al., 2006;
Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009). Gold standard align-
ments are constructed and queried in some way
as to identify complex alignment configurations,
or they are parsed by an all-accepting grammar
such that a parse failure indicates that no align-
ment could be induced by the formalism.
The assumption in this and related work that en-
ables us to introduce a meaningful notion of align-
ment capacity is that simultaneously recognized
words are aligned (Wu, 1997; Zhang and Gildea,
2004; Wellington et al., 2006; Søgaard and Kuhn,
2009). As noted by Søgaard (2009), this defi-
nition of alignment has the advantageous conse-
quence that candidate alignments can be singled
out by mere inspection of the grammar rules. It
also has the consequence that alignments are tran-
sitive (Goutte et al., 2004), since simultaneity is
transitive.
While previous work (Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009)
has estimated empirical lower bounds for normal
form ITGs at the level of translation units (TUER),
or cepts (Goutte et al., 2004), defined as maxi-
mally connected subgraphs in alignments, nobody
has done this for the full class of ITGs. What
is important to understand is that while normal
form ITGs can induce the same class of transla-
tions as the full class of ITGs, they do not induce
the same class of alignments. They do not, for ex-

Aho and Ullman (1972) showed that 4-ary syn-
chronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) could
not be binarized, and Satta and Peserico (2005)
showed that the hiearchy of SCFGs beyond ternary
ones does not collapse; they also showed that the
complexity of the universal recognition problem
for SCFGs is NP-complete. ITGs on the other
hand has a O(|G|n6) solvable universal recog-
nition problem, which coincides with the unre-
stricted alignment problem (Søgaard, 2009). The
result extends to decoding in conjunction with a
bigram language model (Huang et al., 2005).
Wu (1997) introduced ITGs and normal form
ITGs. ITGs are a notational variant of the sub-
class of SCFGs such that all indexed nonterminals
in the source side of the RHS occur in the same
order or exactly in the inverse order in the target
side of the RHS. It turns out that this subclass of
SCFGs defines the same set of translations that can
be defined by binary SCFGs. The different forms
of production rules are listed below with the more
restricted normal form production rules in the right
column, with φ E (N U {e/f  |e E T*, f E T*1)*
(N nonterminals and T terminals, as usual). The
RHS operator [ ] preserves source language con-
stituent order in the target language, while O re-
verses it.1
A → [φ] A → [BC]
A → hφi A → hBCi
A → e/f
Several studies have adressed the alignment ca-
pacity of ITGs and normal form ITGs. Zens and
Ney (2003) induce lower bounds on PRFs for
normal form ITGs. Wellington et al. (2006) in-
duce lower bounds on PRFs for ITGs. Søgaard
and Kuhn (2009) induce lower bounds on TUER
for normal form ITGs and more expressive for-
malisms for syntax-based machine translation. No
one has, however, to the best our knowledge in-
duced lower bounds on TUER for ITGs.
1One reviewer argues that our definition of full ITGs is
not equivalent to the definition in Wu (1997), which, in the
reviewer’s words, allows “at most one lexical item from each
language”. Sect. 6 of Wu (1997), however, explicitly encour-
ages lexical elements in rules to have more than one lexical
item in many cases.

As already mentioned empirical lower bounds
studies differ in four important respects, namely
wrt.: (i) whether they use hand-aligned or auto-
matically aligned gold standards, (ii) the level at
which they count failures, e.g. sentence, align-
ment or translation unit level, (iii) whether they
interpret translation units disjunctively or conjunc-
tively, and (iv) whether they induce the lower
bounds (a) by running an all-accepting grammar
on the gold standard data, (b) by logical charac-
terization of the structures that can be induced by
a formalism, or (c) by counting the frequency of
complex alignment configurations. The advantage
of (a) and (b) is that they are guaranteed to find the
highest possible lower bound on the gold standard
data, whereas (c) is more modular (formalism-
independent) and actually tells us what configu-
rations cause trouble.
(i) In this study we use hand-aligned gold stan-
dard data. It should be obvious why this is prefer-
able to automatically aligned data. The only rea-
son that some previous studies used automatically
aligned data is that hand-aligned data are hard to
come by. This study uses the data also used by
Søgaard and Kuhn (2009), which to the best of
our knowledge uses the largest collection of hand-
aligned parallel corpora used in any of these stud-
ies. (ii) Failures are counted at the level of trans-
lation units as argued for in the above, but sup-
plemented by parse failure rates for completeness.
(iii) Since we count failures at the level of transla-
tion units, it is natural to interpret them conjunc-
tively. Otherwise we would in reality count fail-
ures at the level of alignments. (iv) We use (c).
The conjunctive interpretation of translation
units was also adopted by Fox (2002) and is mo-
tivated by the importance of translation units and
discontinuous ones in particular to machine trans-
lation in general (Simard and colleagues, 2005;
Ayan and Dorr, 2006; Macken, 2007; Shieber,
2007). In brief,

dard, and SU the translation units produced by
the system. This evaluation measure is related to
consistent phrase error rate (CPER) introduced in
Ayan and Dorr (2006), except that it does not only
consider contiguous phrases.

The full class of ITGs induces many alignment
configurations that normal form ITGs do not in-
duce, incl. discontinuous translation units (DTUs),
i.e. translation units with at least one gap, double-
sided DTUs, i.e. DTUs with both a gap in the
source side and a gap in the target side, and multi-
gap DTUs with arbitrarily many gaps (as long as
the contents in the gap are either respect the linear
order of the source side or the inverted order).
ITGs do not induce (i) inside-out alignments,
(ii) cross-serial DTUs, (iii) what is called the “bon-
bon” configuration below, and (iv) multigap DTUs
with mixed order in the target side. The reader is
referred to Wu (1997) for discussion of inside-out
alignments. (ii) and (iii) are explained below.

DTUs are easily induced by unrestricted ITG pro-
ductions, while they cannot be induced by pro-
ductions in normal form. The combination of the
production rules A → [e/ne B nothing/pas] and
B → [change/modifie], for example, induces a
DTU with a gap in the French side for the pair of
substrings (change nothing, ne modifie pas).
Multigap DTUs with up to three gaps are fre-
quent (Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009) and have shown
to be important for translation quality (Simard and
colleagues, 2005). While normal form ITGs do
not induce multigap DTUs, ITGs induce a partic-
ular subclass of multigap DTUs, namely those that
are constructed by linear or inverse interpolation.

Inside-out alignments were first described by
Wu (1997), and their frequency has been a mat-
ter of some debate (Lepage and Denoual, 2005;
Wellington et al., 2006; Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009).
Cross-serial DTUs are made of two DTUs non-
contiguous to the same side such that both have
material in the gap of each other. Bonbons are
similar, except the DTUs are non-contiguous to
different sides, i.e. D has a gap in the source side
that contains at least one token in E, and E has
a gap in the target side that contains at least one
token in D. Here’s an example of a bonbon con-
figuration from Simard et al. (2005):
Pierre ne mange pas
Pierre does not eat
Multigap DTUs with mixed transfer are, as al-
ready mentioned multigap DTUs with crossing
alignments from material in two distinct gaps.

3.3 Results

<bodyText confidence="0.999558666666667">
The lower bounds on TUER for the full class of
ITGs are obtained by summing the ratios of inside-
out alignments, cross-serial DTUs, bonbons and
mixed order multigap DTUs, subtracting any over-
lap between these classes of configurations. The
lower bounds on TUER for normal form ITGs
sum ratios of inside-out aligments and DTUs sub-
tracting any overlap. Figure 1 presents the ratio
(x100), and Figure 2 presents the induced lower
bounds on the full class of ITGs and normal form
ITGs. Any two configurations differ on all trans-
lation units in order to count as two distinct con-
figurations in these statistics. Otherwise a single
translation unit could be removed to simplify two
or more configurations.

<bodyText confidence="0.999936625">
The usefulness of alignment error rate (AER) (Och
and Ney, 2000) has been questioned lately (Fraser
and Marcu, 2007); most importantly, AER does
not always seem to correlate with translation qual-
ity. TUER is likely to correlate better with transla-
tion quality, since it by definition correlates with
CPER (Ayan and Dorr, 2006). No large-scale
experiment has been done yet to estimate the
strength of this correlation.
Our study also relies on the assumption that
simulatenously recognized words are aligned in
bilingual parsing. The relationship between pars-
ing and alignment can of course be complicated in
ways that will alter the alignment capacity of ITG
and its normal form; on some definitions the two
formalisms may even become equally expressive.

Our study also relies on the assumption that simulatenously recognized words are aligned in bilingual parsing. The relationship between parsing and alignment can of course be complicated in ways that will alter the alignment capacity of ITG and its normal form; on some definitions the two formalisms may even become equally expressive. 5 Conclusion It was shown that the absolute reduction in average lower bound on TUER is 2.48 for the full class of ITGs over its canonical normal form.

The assumption in this and related work that enables us to introduce a meaningful notion of alignment capacity is that simultaneously recognized words are aligned (Wu, 1997; Zhang and Gildea, 2004; Wellington et al., 2006; Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009). As noted by Søgaard (2009), this definition of alignment has the advantageous consequence that candidate alignments can be singled out by mere inspection of the grammar rules. It also has the consequence that alignments are transitive (Goutte et al., 2004), since simultaneity is transitive. While previous work (Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009) has estimated empirical lower bounds for normal form ITGs at the level of translation units (TUER), or cepts (Goutte et al., 2004), defined as maximally connected subgraphs in alignments, nobody has done this for the full class of ITGs. What is important to understand is that while normal form ITGs can induce the same class of translations as the full class of ITGs, they do not induce the same class of alignments.

The formalism that has received most attention has been inversion transduction grammars (ITGs) (Wu, 1997). All previous work on the coverage of ITGs, however, concerns parse failure rates (PFRs) or sentence level coverage, which is not directly related to any of the evaluation measures used in machine translation. Søgaard and Kuhn (2009) induce lower bounds on translation unit error rates (TUERs) for a number of formalisms, incl. normal form ITGs, but not for the full class of ITGs. Many of the alignment configurations that cannot be induced by normal form ITGs can be induced by unrestricted ITGs, however. This paper estimates the difference and shows that the average reduction in lower bounds on TUER is 2.48 in absolute difference (16.01 in average parse failure rate). 1 Introduction The first stage in training a machine translation system is typically that of aligning bilingual text.

No one has, however, to the best our knowledge induced lower bounds on TUER for ITGs. 1One reviewer argues that our definition of full ITGs is not equivalent to the definition in Wu (1997), which, in the reviewer’s words, allows “at most one lexical item from each language”.

The only reason that some previous studies used automatically aligned data is that hand-aligned data are hard to come by. This study uses the data also used by Søgaard and Kuhn (2009), which to the best of our knowledge uses the largest collection of handaligned parallel corpora used in any of these studies. (ii) Failures are counted at the level of translation units as argued for in the above, but supplemented by parse failure rates for completeness. (iii) Since we count failures at the level of translation units, it is natural to interpret them conjunctively. Otherwise we would in reality count failures at the level of alignments. (iv) We use (c). The conjunctive interpretation of translation units was also adopted by Fox (2002) and is motivated by the importance of tran</context>

The reader is referred to Wu (1997) for discussion of inside-out alignments. (ii) and (iii) are explained below. 3.2.1 Induced configurations DTUs are easily induced by unrestricted ITG productions, while they cannot be induced by productions in normal form. The combination of the production rules A → [e/ne B nothing/pas] and B → [change/modifie], for example, induces a DTU with a gap in the French side for the pair of substrings (change nothing, ne modifie pas). Multigap DTUs with up to three gaps are frequent (Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009) and have shown to be important for translation quality (Simard and colleagues, 2005). While normal form ITGs do not induce multigap DTUs, ITGs induce a particular subclass of multigap DTUs, namely those that are constructed by linear or inverse interpolation. 3.2.2 Non-induced configurations Inside-out alignments were first described by Wu (1997), and their frequency has been a matter of some debate (Lepage and Denoual, 2005; Wellington et al., 2006; Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009).

Gold standard alignments are constructed and queried in some way as to identify complex alignment configurations, or they are parsed by an all-accepting grammar such that a parse failure indicates that no alignment could be induced by the formalism. The assumption in this and related work that enables us to introduce a meaningful notion of alignment capacity is that simultaneously recognized words are aligned (Wu, 1997; Zhang and Gildea, 2004; Wellington et al., 2006; Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009). As noted by Søgaard (2009), this definition of alignment has the advantageous consequence that candidate alignments can be singled out by mere inspection of the grammar rules. It also has the consequence that alignments are transitive (Goutte et al., 2004), since simultaneity is transitive. While previous work (Søgaard and Kuhn, 2009) has estimated empirical lower bounds for normal form ITGs at the level of translation units (TUER), or cepts (Goutte et al., 2004), defined as maximally connected subgraphs in alignments, nobody has done this for the full class of ITGs.

ITGs on the other hand has a O(|G|n6) solvable universal recognition problem, which coincides with the unrestricted alignment problem (Søgaard, 2009). The result extends to decoding in conjunction with a bigram language model (Huang et al., 2005). Wu (1997) introduced ITGs and normal form ITGs. ITGs are a notational variant of the subclass of SCFGs such that all indexed nonterminals in the source side of the RHS occur in the same order or exactly in the inverse order in the target side of the RHS. It turns out that this subclass of SCFGs defines the same set of translations that can be defined by binary SCFGs.

The formalism that has received most attention has been inversion transduction grammars (ITGs) (Wu, 1997). All previous work on the coverage of ITGs, however, concerns parse failure rates (PFRs) or sentence level coverage, which is not directly related to any of the evaluation measures used in machine translation. Søgaard and Kuhn (2009) induce lower bounds on translation unit error rates (TUERs) for a number of formalisms, incl. normal form ITGs, but not for the full class of ITGs. Many of the alignment configurations that cannot be induced by normal form ITGs can be induced by unrestricted ITGs, however. This paper estimates the difference and shows that the average reduction in lower bounds on</context>
