CoNLL has turned ten! With a mix of pride and amazement over how time flies, we now celebrate
the tenth time that ACL’s special interest group on natural language learning, SIGNLL, holds its yearly
conference.
Having a yearly meeting was the major pillar of the design plan for SIGNLL, drawn up by a circle of
enthusiastic like-minded people around 1995, headed by first president David Powers and first secretary
Walter Daelemans. The first CoNLL was organized as a satellite event of ACL-97 in Madrid, in the
capable hands of Mark Ellison. Since then, no single year has gone by without a CoNLL. The boards
of SIGNLL (with consecutive presidents Michael Brent, Walter Daelemans, and Dan Roth) have made
sure that CoNLL toured the world; twice it was held in the Asian-Pacific part of the world, four times
in Europe, and four times in the North-American continent.
Over time, the field of computational linguistics got to know CoNLL for its particular take on empirical
methods for NLP and the ties these methods have with areas outside the focus of the typical ACL
conference. The image of CoNLL was furthermore boosted by the splendid concept of the shared
task, the organized competition that tackles timely tasks in NLP and has produced both powerful and
sobering scientific insights. The CoNLL shared tasks have produced benchmark data sets and results
on which a significant body of work in computational linguistics is based nowadays. The first shared
task was organized in 1999 on NP bracketing, by Erik Tjong Kim Sang and Miles Osborne. With
the help of others, Erik continued the organization of shared tasks until 2003 (on syntactic chunking,
clause identification, and named-entity recognition), after which Lluis M`arquez and Xavier Carreras
organized two consecutive shared tasks on semantic role labeling (2004, 2005). This year’s shared task
on multi-lingual dependency parsing holds great promise in becoming a new landmark in NLP research.
With great gratitude we salute all past CoNLL programme chairs and reviewers who have made CoNLL
possible, and who have contributed to this conference series, which we believe has a shining future
ahead. We are still exploring unknown territory in the fields of language learning, where models of
human learning and natural language processing may on one day be one. We hope we will see a long
series of CoNLLs along that path.

The 2006 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning is the tenth in a series of yearly
meetings organized by SIGNLL, the ACL special interest group on natural language learning. Due to
the special occasion, we have brought out the celebratory Roman numerals: welcome to CoNLL-X!
Presumably, next year we will return to CoNLL-2007 (until 2016, when perhaps we will see CoNLL-
XX). CoNLL-X will be held in New York City on June 8-9, in conjunction with the HLT-NAACL 2006
conference.
A total of 52 papers were submitted to CoNLL’s main session, from which only 18 were accepted. The
35% acceptance ratio maintains the high competitiveness of recent CoNLLs and is an indicator of this
year’s high-quality programme. We are very grateful to the CoNLL community for the large amount
of exciting, diverse, and high-quality submissions we received. We are equally grateful to the program
committee for their service in reviewing these submissions, on a very tight schedule. Your efforts made
our job a pleasure.
As in previous years, we defined a topic of special interest for the conference. This year, we particularly
encouraged submissions describing architectures, algorithms, methods, or models designed to improve
the robustness of learning-based NLP systems. While the topic of interest was directly addressed by
only a small number of the main session submissions, the shared task setting contributed significantly
in this direction.
Also following CoNLL tradition, a centerpiece of the confernence is a shared task, this year on
multilingual dependency parsing. The shared task was organized by Sabine Buchholz, Amit Dubey,
Yuval Krymolwski, and Erwin Marsi, who worked very hard to make the shared task the success it
has been. Up to 13 different languages were treated. 19 teams submitted results, from which 17 are
presenting description papers in the proceedings. In our opinion, the current shared task constitutes a
qualitative step ahead in the evolution of CoNLL shared tasks, and we hope that the resources created
and the body of work presented will both serve as a benchmark and also have a substantial impact on
future research on syntactic parsing.
Finally, we are delighted to announce that this year’s invited speakers are Michael Collins and Walter
Daelemans. In accordance with the tenth anniversary celebration, Walter Daelemans will look back at
the 10 years of CoNLL conferences, presenting the state of the art in computational natural language
learning, and suggesting a new “mission” for the future of field. Michael Collins, in turn, will talk about
one of the important current research lines in the field: global learning architectures for structural and
relational learning problems in natural language.
In addition to the program committee and shared task organizers, we are very indebted to the SIGNLL
board members for very helpful discussion and advice, Erik Tjong Kim Sang, who acted as the
information officer, and the HLT-NAACL 2006 conference organizers, in particular Robert Moore,
Brian Roark, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Lucy Vanderwende, Roberto Pieraccini, and Liz Liddy for their help
with local arrangements and the publication of the proceedings.
To all the attendees, enjoy the CoNLL-X conference!
