Abstract

We report on two recent medium-scale initiatives
annotating present day English corpora for animacy
distinctions. We discuss the relevance of animacy for
computational linguistics, specifically generation, the
annotation categories used in the two studies and the
interannotator reliability for one of the studies.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952692307692">
It has long been known that animacy is an
important category in syntactic and morphological
natural language analysis. It is less evident that
this dimension should play an important role in
practical natural language processing. After
reviewing some linguistic facts, we argue that it
does play a role in natural language generation and
translation, describe a schema for the annotation of
animacy distinctions, evaluate the reliability of the
scheme and discuss some results obtained. We
conclude with some remarks on the importance of
animacy and other accessibility dimensions for the
architecture of generation schemes
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.5401495" genericHeader="introduction">
2 The animacy dimension in natural
language
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984258064516">
The animacy hierarchy is one of the accessibility
scales that are hypothesized to influence the
grammatical prominence that is given to the
realization of entities within a discourse. Three
important scales (sometimes conflated into one,
also called animacy hierarchy in Silverstein, 1976),
are the definiteness, the person and the animacy
hierarchy proper. We assume these are three
different hierarchies that refer to different aspects
of entity representation within language: the
definiteness dimension is linked to the status of the
entity at a particular point in the discourse, the
person hierarchy depends on the participants
within the discourse, and the animacy status is an
inherent characteristic of the entities referred to.
Each of these aspects, however, orders entities on a
scale that makes them more or less salient or
‘accessible’ when humans use their language.
The importance of accessibility scales is not
widely recognized in computational treatments of
natural language. This contrasts with the situation
in linguistics where such scales have been
recognized as playing an important role in the
organization of sentence syntax and discourse.
Even in natural language studies, however, their
importance has been underestimated because the
role of these scales is not always to distinguish
between grammatical and ungrammatical
utterances but often that of distinguishing mainly
between felicitous and infelicitous ones, especially
in languages such as English.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.929397">
Grammaticality and acceptability
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859846153846">
As long as one’s attention is limited to the
distinction between grammatical and
ungrammatical sentences, the importance of the
animacy hierarchy in particular is mainly relevant
for languages with a richer morphology than
English. In such languages animacy distinctions
can influence grammaticality of e.g. case-marking
and voice selection. To give just one example, in
Navaho, a bi-form is used rather than an yi-form
whenever the patient is animate and the agent is
inanimate, whereas the yi-form is used when the
agent is animate and the patient is inanimate as
illustrated in (1) (from Comrie 1989 p. 193).

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99844959375">
The girl burnt the potato.
(b) At’eed n’masi bi-d’’l’d

The potato burnt the girl.
Other phenomena discussed in the literature are
agreement limited to animate noun phrases
(Comrie, 1989), overt case-marking of subject
limited to inanimates or overt case-marking of
objects limited to animates (Aissen, 2003, see also
Bossong 1985 and 1991), object agreement in
Bantu languages (see e.g. Woolford, 1999), choice
between direct and inverse voice in Menominee
(Bloomfield, 1962, see also, Trommer, n.d.).
Recent linguistic studies have highlighted the
importance of the category in languages such as
English. For instance the choice between the Saxon
genitive and the of-genitive (Rosenbach, 2002,
2003, O’Connor et al. 2004, Leech et al. 1994),
between the double NP and the prepositional
dative (Cueni et al, work in progress) and between
active and passive (Rosenbach et al. 2002, Bock et
al. 1992, McDonald et al. 1993) and between
pronominal and full noun reference (Dahl and
Fraurud, 1996, based on Swedish data) have all
been shown to be sensitive to the difference
between animate and inanimate referents for the
arguments with variable realization. In these cases
the difference between animate and inanimate does
not lead to a difference between a grammatical or
an ungrammatical sentence as in the cases cited in
the previous paragraph but to a difference in
acceptability.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.966105">
Interaction between animacy and other scales
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999815157894737">
As mentioned above, the term ‘animacy hierarchy’
is used in two ways, one to refer to an ordering
imposed on definiteness, animacy and person and
the other where it refers to animacy proper. The
reason for this lies in the interaction between the
different factors that determine accessibility.
It is conceptually desirable to distinguish between
animacy and definiteness but in practice it is
frequently the case that a linguistic phenomenon is
conditioned by more than one of these
conceptually independent factors (see e.g. Comrie,
1989 for discussion). The projects in the context
of which the annotation tasks described here were
performed (see description below, section 5) also
encode some of these interacting factors. The
LINK-project encodes information status (see
Nissim et al, 2004) and the Boston project encodes
definiteness and expression type (i.e., NP form) as
proxies for information status.

3 Animacy as a factor in generation and
translation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952285714286">
As long as animacy was discussed as a relevant
grammatical category in languages that had not
been studied from a computational point of view,
its importance for computational linguistics was
perceived as rather limited. The fact that it
permeates the choice between constructions in
languages such as English changes this perception.
The category is of obvious importance for high
quality generation and translation.
For instance, if one is faced with the task of
generating a sentence from a three place predicate,
P (a,b,c), and one has the choice of rendering either
b or c as the direct object, knowing that c is human
and b is abstract would lead one to choose c ceteris
paribus. However, everything else is rarely equal
and the challenge for generation will be to assign
the exact relative weights to factors such as
animacy, person distinction and recency.
Moreover, the importance of these factors needs to
be combined with that of heterogeneous
considerations such as the length of the resulting
expression.
In the context of translation we need also to keep
in mind the possibility that the details of the
animacy ranking might be different from language
to language and that the relative impact of animacy
and other accessibility scale factors might be
different from construction to construction.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.985398" genericHeader="method">
4 The Animacy Hierarchy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994391891892">
Given the pervasive importance of animacy
information in human languages one might expect
it to be a well-understood linguistic category.
Nothing could be farther from the truth. Linguistic
descriptions appeal to a hierarchy that in its
minimal form distinguishes between human, non-
human animate and inanimate but can contain
more distinctions, such as distinctions between
higher and lower animals (see Yamamoto, 1999 for
a particularly elaborated scheme).
What makes it difficult to develop clear categories
of animacy is that the linguistically relevant
distinctions between animate and non-animate and
between human and non-human are not the same
as the biological distinctions. Part of this research
is devoted to discovering the principles that
underlie the distinctions; and the type of
distinctions proposed depend on the assumptions
that a researcher makes about the underlying
motivation for them, e.g. as a reflection of the
language user’s empathy with living beings (e.g.
Yamamoto, 1999). What is of particular interest
for natural language processing is the observation
that the distinctions are most likely not the same
across languages (cf. Comrie, 1989) and can even
change over time in a given language. They are
similar to other scalar phenomena such as voicing
onset times that play a role in different languages
but where the categorization into voiced and
unvoiced does not correspond to the same physical
boundary in each language. But whereas voicing
onset times can be physically measured, we do not
have an objective measure of animacy. The
categories involved correspond to the degree to
which various entities are construed as human-like
by a given group of speakers and at this point we
have no language independent measure for this.
Moreover, languages make ample use of metaphor
and metonomy. The intent of an animacy coding is
to encode the animacy status of the referent of the
linguistic expression. But sometimes in figurative
language it is not clear what the referent it.
Especially prevalent cases of metonomy are the
use of names to refer both to organizations (e.g.
IBM) and to characteristic members of them, and
the use of place names (e.g. Russia) to refer both to
organizational entities and geographical places or
inhabitants of them. Terms belonging to these
semantic classes are systematically ambiguous.
Whereas it is true that animacy can be determined
by looking at the entity an expression refers to, in
practice it is not always clear what the referent of
an expression is.
The notions that the animacy hierarchy appeals to,
then, are not a priori well defined. And work is
necessary on two levels: to better define which
distinctions play a role in English and to determine
where they play a role. Conceptually, it might be
desirable to replace the idea of a hierarchy with
discrete classes by a partial ordering of entities.
This is, however, not the place to pursue this idea.
Fortunately, one doesn’t need to wait until the first
problem is solved completely to tackle the second.
The results obtained in certain linguistic contexts
are robust for the top and the bottom of the
hierarchy. Uncertainty about the middle does not
prevent us from establishing the importance of the
dimension as such. Refining the definition of
animacy will, however, be important for more
detailed studies of the interaction between the
various accessibility hierarchies. This more precise
notion will be needed for cross-linguistic studies,
and, in the context of natural language processing,
for high quality generation and translation.

5 Animacy Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998843742857143">
As we have discussed above, the animacy scale is
an important factor in the choice of certain
construction in English. But it is only a soft
constraint and as such outside of the realm of
things that native speakers have clear judgments
about. The best ways to study such phenomena are
psychological experiments and corpus analysis.
The annotation exercise we engaged in is meant to
facilitate the latter.
Given the situation described with respect to
animacy categories, a natural way to proceed is to
start with a commonsensical approach and see
where it leads. In 2000-2002, two rather similar
initiatives led to the need for animacy annotations:
one, the paraphrase-project, a collaboration
between Stanford and Edinburgh, concentrating on
the factors that influence the choice between
different sentence level syntactic paraphrases
(Bresnan et al. 2002) and another concentrating on
the possessive alternation (O’Connor, 2000). The
two projects used a very similar animacy
annotation scheme, developed in the context of the
O’Connor project.
The scheme was used in two different ways. The
Boston team coded 20,000 noun phrases in
‘possessive’ constructions from the Brown Corpus.
The first round of coding was automated, with the
animacy annotation based primarily on word lists
and morphological information. The second round
was performed manually by pairs of coders using a
decision tree. The two coders were required to
agree on each code; every case in which there was
not complete agreement was discussed by the rest
of the team, until a choice of code was made. This
way of annotating does not lend itself to a study of
reliability, except between the automated coder
and the human coders as a group. For more
information on this use of the coding system, see
Garretson &amp; O’Connor (2004).
In what follows we concentrate on the use of the
coding scheme in the Stanford-Edinburgh
paraphrase project.
The overall aim of the paraphrase project is to
provide the community of linguists and
computational linguists with a corpus that can be
used to calculate the impact of the various factors
on different constructions. The annotation scheme
assumes that the main distinction is three-way:
human, other animates and inanimates, but the two
latter categories are subdivided further as follows:
- Other animates: organizations, animals,
intelligent machines and vehicles.
- Inanimates: concrete inanimate, non-concrete
inanimate, place and time.
The category ‘organization’ is important because
organizations are often presented as groups of
humans engaging in actions that are typically
associated with humans (they make
pronouncements, decisions, etc.). The categories
place and time are especially important for the
possessive encoding as it has often been observed
that some spatial and temporal expressions are
realized as Saxon genitives (see e.g. Rosenbach
(2002)).
For the cases in which no clear decision could be
made, a category ‘variable animacy’ was invented,
and the coders were also given the option to defer
the decision by marking an item with ‘oanim’.
The overall coding scheme, with a summary of the
instructions given to the coders, looks as follows1
</bodyText>

HUMAN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9920762">
Refers to one or more humans; this includes
imaginary entities that are presented as human,
gods, elves, ghosts, etc.: things that look human
and act like humans.
ORG
This tag was proposed for collectivities of humans
when displaying some degree of group identity.
The properties that are deemed relevant can be
represented by the following implicational
hierarchy:
+/- chartered/official
+/- temporally stable
+/- collective voice/purpose
+/- collective action
+/- collective
The cut-off point between HUMAN and ORG was
put at ‘having a collective voice/purpose’: so a
group with collective voice and purpose is deemed
to be an ORG, a group with collective action, such
as a mob, is not an ORG.

Non-human animates, including viruses and

PLACE
The tag is used for nominals that ‘refer to a place
as a place’. There are two different problems with
the delimitation of place. On the one hand, any
location can be a place, e.g. a table, a drawer, a
pinhead, É The coding scheme takes the view that
only potential locations for humans are thought of
as ‘places’. On the other hand some places can be
thought of as ORGs. The tag was applied in a
rather restricted way, for instance in a sentence
such as ‘my house was built in 1960’, ‘my house’
is coded as CONC (see below), whereas in ‘I was
at my house’, it would be a PLACE.
TIME
This tag is meant to be applied to expressions
referring to periods of time. It was applied rather
liberally.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.773705" genericHeader="method">
CONCRETE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.959822666666667">
This tag is restricted to ‘prototypical’ concrete
objects or substances. Excluded are things like air,

NONCONC
This is the default category. It is used for events,
and anything else that is not prototypically
concrete but clearly inanimate.
MAC
A minor tag used for intelligent machines, such as
computers or robots.
VEH
Another minor category used for vehicles as it
has been observed that these are treated as living
beings in some linguistic contexts (e.g. pronoun
selection in languages such as English where
normal gender distinctions only apply to animates).

one to indicate that the coder is not entirely sure of
the code and thinks there are reasons to give
another code too.
Finally, NOT-UNDERSTOOD was supposed to
be used when the text as a whole was not clear.
Three coders coded the parsed part of the
Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al. 1992) over the
summer of 2003. The corpus consists of around
600 transcribed dialogues on various
predetermined topics among speakers of American
English. Before the annotation exercise began, the
dialogues were converted into XML (Carletta et al.
2004). The entities that needed to be annotated
(the NPs and possessives determiners) were
automatically selected and filtered for the coders.
The three coders were undergraduate students at
Stanford University who were paid for the work.
The schema presented above was discussed with
them and presented in the form of a decision tree.
Difficult cases were discussed but eventually each
coder worked independently. 599 dialogues were
annotated.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.963868" genericHeader="method">
6 Coding reliability
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988091246153846">
The reliability of the annotation was evaluated
using the kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996).
Although there are no hard and fast rules about
what makes an acceptable kappa coefficient—it
depends on the use to which the data will be
put—many researchers in the computational
linguistics community have adopted the rule of
thumb that discourse annotation should have a
kappa of at least .8.
For the reliability study, we had three
individuals work separately to code the same four
dialogues with the animacy scheme. Markables (in
this case NPs and possessives) had been extracted
automatically from the data, leading the coders to
mark around 10% of the overall set with a category
that indicated that they were not proper markables
and therefore not to be coded. Omitting these
(non-) markables, for the data set overall, K=.92
(k=3, N=1081).
In general, coders did not agree about which cases
were problematic enough to mark as VANIM, and
omitting the markables that any coder marked as
problematic using the VANIM code leads to a
slight improvement (K=.96, k=3,N=1135).
It is important to note that these kappa coefficients
are so high primarily because two categories which
are easy to differentiate from each other, HUMAN
and NONCONC, swamp the rest of the categories.
The cross-coder reliability for them is satisfactory
but the intermediate categories were not defined
well enough to allow reliable coding.
Figure 1 shows the confusion matrix for the data
including markables that any coder marker
additionally as problematic using the VANIM
notation. Considering the coders one pair at a
time, the matrix records the frequency with which
one coder of the pair chose the category named in
the row header whilst the other chose the category
named in the column header for the same
markable.
Although we were aware of the less than formal
definitions given for the categories, we had hoped
that the coders would share the intuitive
understanding of the developers of the categories.
This is obviously not the case for all categories.
What was also surprising was that allowing coders
to mark cases as problematic using the VANIM
code was not worthwhile, since the coders did not
often take advantage of this option and taking the
VANIM codes into account during analysis has
little effect.
Analysis of the four annotated dialogues points to
several sources for the intercoder disagreement.
• The categories TIME and PLACE were
defined in a way that did not coincide with the
coders’ intuitive understanding of them. The
tag TIME was supposed to refer to ‘periods of
time’. This led to some wavering
interpretations for temporal expressions that do
not designate a once-occurring period of time.
For instance ‘this time’ and ‘next time’ were
coded as TIME by two coders but as
‘NONCONC” by the third one. Clearer
training on what was meant could have helped
here.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.923981">
• As mentioned above, the choice
between HUMAN, ORG and NONCONC
depended on how the coders interpreted the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998875142857143">
referent of the expression. Although
guidelines were given about the difference
between HUMAN and ORG (see above), the
cut-off point wasn’t always clear2. The
distinction between ORGs as proposed in our
schema and less organized human groups
seems too fluctuating to be useful.

reference: for instance a school as an

coders but later in the dialogue there is
discussion about the what is done with napping
children in the school and one speaker says ‘if
they (the children) fall asleep they kind of let
them sleep’, one coder interpreted that the
second ‘they’ as simply referring to the school
organization and marked it as ORG, whereas
another interpreted it as referring to a rather
vague group of humans, presumably some
teachers, and marked it as HUMAN. This
vagueness of reference is quite prevalent in
spoken language, especially with the pronoun
‘they’.
• Attention errors, e.g. vehicles were

supposed to get a special code but, presumably
because there were so few, this was sometimes
forgotten. One coder coded ‘a couple of
weeks’ as HUMAN. These kinds of mistakes
are unavoidable and the very tools that make
the encoding easier (e.g. the automatic
advancing from one markable to another)
might make them more frequent.
While the problems with ORG and HUMAN don’t
come as a surprise, the difficulties with PLACE,
TIME and CONCRETE are more surprising. The
two minor classes, MAC and VEH and the
ANIMAL class occurred so seldom that no
significant results were obtained in this sample.
They were equally rare in the corpus as a whole.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980291158730159">
We are not aware of any other medium-scale
attempts to annotate corpora of contemporary
English for animacy information apart from the
two mentioned here. There are smaller efforts
concentrating on the genitive alternation (e.g.
Leech et al., 1994, Anschutz, 1997, Stefanowitsch,
2000)3. The resources that have been created give
robust results for the opposition ‘human’ versus
‘nonconcrete’ entities in the large sense (as the
category was used as a catch-all). This should
suffice for further inquiries about linguistic
processes that are sensitive to a binary opposition
in this dimension. Moreover the Stanford-
Edinburgh effort is integrated in a corpus that has
already been marked up for syntactic information,
so correlations between syntactic constructions and
animacy (and information status) should be easy to
calculate. It is also the first effort that studies
inter-annotator reliability.
Some studies based on the annotations are
currently being conducted. The study by Cueni,
Bresnan, Nikitina and Baayen (2004) supplements
partial data from the work described here with
further annotations. The work reported by
O’Connor et al. (2004) derives from the Boston
use of the encoding described here. Within the
paraphrase project we are currently investigation
3 Some related work is done in the context of entity
tracking sponsored by various US government programs
(ACE, TIDES, etc.). The proposed annotation schemes
have problems in distinguishing between persons and
organizations or geo-political entities that are similar to
ours, but the basic categories and the aims of these
enterprises are different. We have not reviewed them
here.
the possible effect of animacy on constructions
such as Left-Dislocation and Topicalization.
Further work remains to be done, however, to
determine the exact nature of the distinctions in the
animacy dimension that are important for English
and for other languages. The annotations we
provide do not settle this issue. In that sense they
are insufficient to guide generation and translation
precisely. To investigate this further we will need
to devise more careful annotation schemes and
approach the problem via experiments where the
hypothesized relative animacy of various entities
can be carefully controlled. As mentioned above, it
might be better not to think in terms of robust large
categories but rather try to rank specific entities or
small categories relative to each other and to
gradually build up a more precise picture. This is
most likely better done through controlled
experiments than through corpus annotation.
The annotated corpus, however, will be helpful to
determine where animacy plays a role and which
other factors it interacts with. This knowledge will
help devise more adequate generation and
translation architectures.

paraphrase corpus will be made available to

While the problems with ORG and HUMAN don’t come as a surprise, the difficulties with PLACE, TIME and CONCRETE are more surprising. The two minor classes, MAC and VEH and the ANIMAL class occurred so seldom that no significant results were obtained in this sample. They were equally rare in the corpus as a whole. 7 Conclusion We are not aware of any other medium-scale attempts to annotate corpora of contemporary English for animacy information apart from the two mentioned here. There are smaller efforts concentrating on the genitive alternation (e.g. Leech et al., 1994, Anschutz, 1997, Stefanowitsch, 2000)3. The resources that have been created give robust results for the opposition ‘human’ versus ‘nonconcrete’ entities in the large sense (as the category was used as a catch-all). This should suffice for further inquiries about linguistic processes that are sensitive to a binary opposition in this dimension. Moreover the StanfordEdinburgh effort is integrated in a corpus that has already been marked up for syntactic information, so correlations between syntactic constructions and animacy (and information status) should be easy to calculate. It is also the first effort that</context>

The annotation exercise we engaged in is meant to facilitate the latter. Given the situation described with respect to animacy categories, a natural way to proceed is to start with a commonsensical approach and see where it leads. In 2000-2002, two rather similar initiatives led to the need for animacy annotations: one, the paraphrase-project, a collaboration between Stanford and Edinburgh, concentrating on the factors that influence the choice between different sentence level syntactic paraphrases (Bresnan et al. 2002) and another concentrating on the possessive alternation (O’Connor, 2000). The two projects used a very similar animacy annotation scheme, developed in the context of the O’Connor project. The scheme was used in two different ways. The Boston team coded 20,000 noun phrases in ‘possessive’ constructions from the Brown Corpus. The first round of coding was automated, with the animacy annotation based primarily on word lists and morphological information. The second round was performed manually by pairs of coders using a decision tree. The two coders were required to agree on each code; every cas</context>

In such languages animacy distinctions can influence grammaticality of e.g. case-marking and voice selection. To give just one example, in Navaho, a bi-form is used rather than an yi-form whenever the patient is animate and the agent is inanimate, whereas the yi-form is used when the agent is animate and the patient is inanimate as illustrated in (1) (from Comrie 1989 p. 193).

Interaction between animacy and other scales As mentioned above, the term ‘animacy hierarchy’ is used in two ways, one to refer to an ordering imposed on definiteness, animacy and person and the other where it refers to animacy proper. The reason for this lies in the interaction between the different factors that determine accessibility. It is conceptually desirable to distinguish between animacy and definiteness but in practice it is frequently the case that a linguistic phenomenon is conditioned by more than one of these conceptually independent factors (see e.g. Comrie, 1989 for discussion). The projects in the context of which the annotation tasks described here were performed (see description below, section 5) also encode some of these interacting factors. The LINK-project encodes information status (see Nissim et al, 2004) and the Boston project encodes definiteness and expression type (i.e., NP form) as proxies for information status. 3 Animacy as a factor in generation and translation As long as animacy was discussed as a relevant grammatical category in languages that had not been studied from a computational point of view, its importance for computational </context>

Part of this research is devoted to discovering the principles that underlie the distinctions; and the type of distinctions proposed depend on the assumptions that a researcher makes about the underlying motivation for them, e.g. as a reflection of the language user’s empathy with living beings (e.g. Yamamoto, 1999). What is of particular interest for natural language processing is the observation that the distinctions are most likely not the same across languages (cf. Comrie, 1989) and can even change over time in a given language. They are similar to other scalar phenomena such as voicing onset times that play a role in different languages but where the categorization into voiced and unvoiced does not correspond to the same physical boundary in each language. But whereas voicing onset times can be physically measured, we do not have an objective measure of animacy. The categories involved correspond to the degree to which various entities are construed as human-like by a given group of speakers and at this point we have no language independent measure for this.

The properties that are deemed relevant can be represented by the following implicational hierarchy: +/- chartered/official +/- temporally stable +/- collective voice/purpose +/- collective action +/- collective The cut-off point between HUMAN and ORG was put at ‘having a collective voice/purpose’: so a group with collective voice and purpose is deemed to be an ORG, a group with collective action, such as a mob, is not an ORG. 1 For a more extensive description of the annotation scheme see Garretson et al. 2004. ANIMAL Non-human animates, including viruses and bacteria. PLACE The tag is used for nominals that ‘refer to a place as a place’. There are two different problems with the delimitation of place. On the one hand, any location can be a place, e.g. a table, a drawer, a pinhead, É The coding scheme takes the view that only potential locations for humans are thought of as ‘places’. On the other hand some places can be thought of as ORGs.

OANIM This tag is used when the coder is completely unsure and wants to come back to the example later. VANIM This tag can be used in conjunction with another one to indicate that the coder is not entirely sure of the code and thinks there are reasons to give another code too. Finally, NOT-UNDERSTOOD was supposed to be used when the text as a whole was not clear. Three coders coded the parsed part of the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al. 1992) over the summer of 2003. The corpus consists of around 600 transcribed dialogues on various predetermined topics among speakers of American English. Before the annotation exercise began, the dialogues were converted into XML (Carletta et al. 2004). The entities that needed to be annotated (the NPs and possessives determiners) were automatically selected and filtered for the coders. The three coders were undergraduate students at Stanford University who were paid for the work. The schema presented above was discussed with them and presented in the form of a decision tree.

The category ‘organization’ is important because organizations are often presented as groups of humans engaging in actions that are typically associated with humans (they make pronouncements, decisions, etc.). The categories place and time are especially important for the possessive encoding as it has often been observed that some spatial and temporal expressions are realized as Saxon genitives (see e.g. Rosenbach (2002)). For the cases in which no clear decision could be made, a category ‘variable animacy’ was invented, and the coders were also given the option to defer the decision by marking an item with ‘oanim’. The overall coding scheme, with a summary of the instructions given to the coders, looks as follows1 HUMAN Refers to one or more humans; this includes imaginary entities that are presented as human, gods, elves, ghosts, etc.: things that look human and act like humans.

We conclude with some remarks on the importance of animacy and other accessibility dimensions for the architecture of generation schemes 2 The animacy dimension in natural language The animacy hierarchy is one of the accessibility scales that are hypothesized to influence the grammatical prominence that is given to the realization of entities within a discourse. Three important scales (sometimes conflated into one, also called animacy hierarchy in Silverstein, 1976), are the definiteness, the person and the animacy hierarchy proper. We assume these are three different hierarchies that refer to different aspects of entity representation within language: the definiteness dimension is linked to the status of the entity at a particular point in the discourse, the person hierarchy depends on the participants within the discourse, and the animacy status is an inherent characteristic of the entities referred to. Each of these aspects, however, orders entities on a scale that makes them more or less salient or ‘accessible’ when humans use their language. The imp</context>

While the problems with ORG and HUMAN don’t come as a surprise, the difficulties with PLACE, TIME and CONCRETE are more surprising. The two minor classes, MAC and VEH and the ANIMAL class occurred so seldom that no significant results were obtained in this sample. They were equally rare in the corpus as a whole. 7 Conclusion We are not aware of any other medium-scale attempts to annotate corpora of contemporary English for animacy information apart from the two mentioned here. There are smaller efforts concentrating on the genitive alternation (e.g. Leech et al., 1994, Anschutz, 1997, Stefanowitsch, 2000)3. The resources that have been created give robust results for the opposition ‘human’ versus ‘nonconcrete’ entities in the large sense (as the category was used as a catch-all). This should suffice for further inquiries about linguistic processes that are sensitive to a binary opposition in this dimension. Moreover the StanfordEdinburgh effort is integrated in a corpus that has already been marked up for syntactic information, so correlations between syntactic constructions and animacy (and information status) should be easy to calculate. It is also the first effort that studies inter-annotat</context>

Nothing could be farther from the truth. Linguistic descriptions appeal to a hierarchy that in its minimal form distinguishes between human, nonhuman animate and inanimate but can contain more distinctions, such as distinctions between higher and lower animals (see Yamamoto, 1999 for a particularly elaborated scheme). What makes it difficult to develop clear categories of animacy is that the linguistically relevant distinctions between animate and non-animate and between human and non-human are not the same as the biological distinctions. Part of this research is devoted to discovering the principles that underlie the distinctions; and the type of distinctions proposed depend on the assumptions that a researcher makes about the underlying motivation for them, e.g. as a reflection of the language user’s empathy with living beings (e.g. Yamamoto, 1999).
