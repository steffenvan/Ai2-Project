We present an overview of a compre-
hensive formal theory of the interpreta-
tion of sentential fragments, which has
as components an empirically validated
taxonomy, an analysis of the syntax and
compositional semantics of fragments,
and a formalisation of their contextual
interpretation. We also briefly describe

In dialogue settings, people frequently produce ut-
terances which, despite being non-sentential, con-
vey propositions, questions or requests. For in-
stance, B’s utterance in (1) of the NP “John” con-
veys in this context the proposition “John came to
the party.”

B: John.

Clearly, the interpretation of such non-sentential
utterances or fragments, as they are traditionally
called (eg. (Morgan, 1973)) is highly context de-
pendent. In this paper we present an overview of
a comprehensive formal theory of the interpretation
of fragments.1
The theory has as components an empirically val-
idated taxonomy, an analysis of the syntax and com-
positional semantics of fragments, and a formal-
isation of their contextual interpretation. We also
briefly describe an implementation of this theory,

and quantify the potential practical use of handling
utterances of this kind in dialogue systems.
The main thesis of our approach is that the res-
olution of the intended content of fragments can be
modelled as a by-product of the establishment of
coherence in dialogue, which (following much of
the work on discourse) we define as the establish-
ment of a meaningful connection of the content of
the current utterance to its discourse context. We
will show that the constraints on the form and con-
tent of fragments follow from such connections.
There has recently been some renewed interest
in fragments. For example, (Carberry, 1990) of-
fers an approach where computationally expens-
ive plan-recognition techniques are employed for
their interpretation. As we will show, this fails
to predict certain empirical facts and further, we
will show that the complex reasoning with cognit-
ive states that she employs can often be replaced
with much simpler inferences based on linguistic
information. (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) on the other
hand uses grammar-based methods which, as we
will show, are too weak to explain the interpreta-
tion of certain kinds of fragments where their miss-
ing content is linguistically implicit and has to be
inferred. Moreover, we will show that the non-
compositionality of that approach has certain dis-
advantages.
The remainder of the paper is organised as fol-
lows. We first describe our empirically validated,
two-dimensional taxonomy of fragment-types and
say something about the distribution of these types
in corpora. In our theory, the type instantiated by
a given fragment determines how it is resolved, but
before we formalise this in Section 5, we present in
Sections 3 and 4 respectively an analysis of the se-
mantics and syntax of such utterances in isolation.
This separation of grammar and resolution has cer-
tain advantages, as we discuss in comparison to pre-
vious work.

2.1 The Taxonomy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997734">
We classify fragments according to two dimen-
sions. In the first dimension, the criterion for clas-
sification is the source of the material that is needed
for resolution. In examples like (1), all informa-
tion that is required to resolve the meaning of the
fragment (we will soon say something about what
kind of information we assume this to be, syntactic
or semantic) is present in the context: the resolu-
tion “John came to the party” can be computed by
identifying the ‘missing’ content in “John” with ele-
ments from the utterance it is related to, ie. the ques-
tion. We call this type of resolution resolution-via-
identity. However, there are also examples where
required information is linguistically implicit, as in
(2).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.65805">
(2) A: Why did John leave?
B: Exams.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998446">
If John is a student and this fact is mutually known
by the dialogue participants, then B’s utterance is
presumably resolved to something like “John left
because he has to take an exam soon”. This res-
olution contains elements that are not linguistically
explicit in the utterance to which the fragment is a
reply; the resolution has to be inferred, from both
linguistic sources (the content of the fragment and
the content of its discourse context) and also extra-
linguistic sources (knowledge about preparing for
exams, for example). Hence we call this type of
resolution resolution-via-inference. We will show
below that there are different constraints on frag-
ments of these types.
In the second dimension fragments are categor-
ised by their discourse-function or rhetorical role
with respect to elements of the context. For ex-
ample, in both (1) and (2), the fragment provides
an answer to a question, and so we call the type
these fragments instantiate Question-Answer Pair
(QAP).2 As this name suggests, strictly speaking
this dimension does not classify fragments as such,
but rather the relation a given fragment has to ele-
ments of its context. To make this explicit, our types
are defined as relations, that is, the element of the

2That both (1) and (2) instantiate this type shows
that the dimensions are indeed independent, since as dis-
cussed above in the first dimension they belong to differ-
ent classes.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961793103448">
context the fragment connects to is explicitly part
of what individuates the type.3
As a theoretical backbone for the taxonomy, we
used the rhetorical relations defined by a theory
of discourse structure called SDRT (Asher, 1993;
Asher and Lascarides, 2003), which is also the
framework in which we formalised the resolution
of fragments. However, we also used corpora
to motivate the set of fragment-types in our tax-
onomy. We manually identified all instances of
non-sentential utterances in a number of transcripts
of dialogues and classified their relation to the con-
text.4 The resulting list of relations is given in
Tables 1 and 2, together with informal definitions
of the semantics of each relation (where 0 is the
fragment and a the utterance it is related to) and
an example instance. We will not go into more de-
tails of the types here; in Section 5 we will return
to a select few and give a formal definition of their
semantics. Note that we do not claim that this set
of fragment-types is exhaustive; we discuss in the
next section the coverage that can be achieve with
it on test data.5 As a final point, note that we sub-
sume what is often called “clarification question”
(eg. (Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001)) under Elabora-
tion to stress the similarity with ‘normal’ elabora-
tions. The subscripts p and y indicate the message
type of a and 0; e.g. Elabpy is an elaboration of a
proposition, performed with a question.

2.2 Corpus Study
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985799230769231">
To test the coverage that can be achieved with
our taxonomy, we analysed 5087 items of general
free conversation from the BNC (dialogues KSU
and KSV), and 4037 items of task-oriented dia-
logue from the VM/redwoods corpus (the 125 dia-
logues on the VM-CD-ROM 6).6 We proceeded
3All taxonomies of fragment-types that are known
to us use classes that are at least partially determined
by the rhetorical function of the fragment (eg., that of
(Carberry, 1990) as well as that of (Fern´andez and Gin-
zburg, 2002)); nevertheless, to our knowledge ours is the
only one to make this inherent relationality explicit in the
formal definition of the classes.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.997698166666667">
4For this we used two dialogue transcripts from the
BNC (Aston and Burnard, 1998) and five dialogues from
the Verbmobil corpus (Wahlster, 2000).
5A systematic omission are relations that connect re-
quests. In the dialogues we looked at (which were nego-
tiations and free conversation) these did not occur; how-
ever, in more task-oriented dialogues they will presum-
ably be quite frequent. Note that there is no principled
reason for not including them, and our approach could
easily be extended accordingly.
6We held out this data in the compilation stage, and
so ‘training’ and ‘test-data’ are disjoint.

Discussion The overall percentage of fragments
we have found seems to confirm the results of
earlier studies (Thompson, 1980; Fern´andez and
Ginzburg, 2002), which also classified as frag-
ments around 10% of the utterances in the dialogues
they looked at. (Fern´andez and Ginzburg, 2002)
also offers a taxonomy of fragment types; the au-
thors claim to have reached a coverage which is
much higher than what we achieved (99% com-
pared to our 93%). We think this can partially be
explained by the fact that the classes they use are
more surface-oriented. For example, they have a
class ‘sluice’, which is defined as “bare question-
denoting wh-phrases” (Fern´andez and Ginzburg,
2002, p.16). We make a finer distinction, split-
ting this class further according to the rhetorical
function played by the fragmental question (eg.,
Explq, Expl9, Narrq, Elabq). Hence, to classify a
given fragment we need more information about its
rhetorical function; information which sometimes
is difficult to recover from a transcript. While a
surface-oriented approach to defining classes is an
advantage for annotation, it is a hindrance for form-
ally defining their semantics, as we will argue be-
low.
In conclusion, we think that this corpus study has
shown that our taxonomy has satisfactory empirical
motivation. In the next two sections we look at frag-
ments in isolation. We return to the taxonomy when
we give an example of the formal semantics of re-
lations and show how they determine the resolution
of the fragments.

3 A Compositional Semantics for
Fragments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997328">
For compositional semantic analysis we use Min-
imal Recursion Semantics (MRS, (Copestake et al.,
1999)), a language in which partial descriptions of
formulae of a logical language (the base language)
can be expressed. This allows one to leave cer-
tain semantic distinctions unresolved, reflecting the
idea that syntax supplies only partial information
about meaning. Technically this is achieved via a
strategy that has become standard in computational
semantics (e.g., (Reyle, 1993)): one assigns labels
to bits of base language formulae so that state-
ments about their combination can remain ‘under-
specified’. The (first-order) models of formulae of
this latter language then can be seen as standing in
a direct relation to formulae of the base language;
M �= 0 then means that the (unique) base-language
formula corresponding to M is described by the
MRS 0.8 By way of example, (3) shows an MRS-
representation of “Everyone loves someone”, where
so-called elementary predications (EPs) are labelled
with handles (hn), with h being the top handle that
outscopes all others; ‘h1 =q h2’ stands for an ‘out-
scopes’ relation between EPs where only quantifiers
can be scoped in between h1 and h2; prpstn rel sig-
nals that the MRS describes a proposition.

<equation confidence="0.711256666666667">
(3) (h, e, {h: prpstn rel(h1), h2: love v rel(e, x1, x2),
h6: every rel(x1, ha, h9),
h10: person rel(x1),
h11 : some rel(x2, h12, h13),
h14: person rel(x2)},
{ h1 =e h2, ha =e h10, h12 =e h14 })
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997456454545455">
The compositional semantics of fragments leaves
more information unresolved than just semantic
scope, however. All we know about the meaning of
fragments like those in (1) and (2) independent from
their context is: (a) they will resolve to a proposi-
tion,9 of which (b) the main predicate is unknown,
but (c) one participant in the main event is specified
although its exact role isn’t. We represent this with
an anaphoric relation unknown rel, and so the NP-
fragment “John.” (regardless of the context it stands
in) is represented as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984991">
(4) (h, e, {h: prpstn rel(h1),
h2: unknown rel(e, x),
h6: def np rel(x, ha, h9),

h10 : named(x, John)},
{ h1 =9 h2, ha =e h10 } )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999372">
The unknown rel acts as a ‘place-holder’ for a po-
tentially complex sub-formula; more precisely it is
a constraint on the form of the described (base-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.743232181818182">
8Such a semantics if given to MRS in (Copestake et
al., 2001); we follow the similar formalisation in (Asher
and Lascarides, 2003). Note that we do not make any
assumptions about the base language and its logic here;
the descriptions are compatible with it being static first
order predicate logic, or a dynamic logic like DRT (Kamp
and Reyle, 1993).
9We make the simplifying assumption that there is
an unambiguous intonation pattern indicating whether a
fragment is intended to convey a proposition, a question
or a request.

language) formulae, that they contain at this place
a subformula, which in the case of (4) must have e
and x amongst its variables. Clearly, such a descrip-
tion then describes an infinite number of formulae;
however, all of these are potential resolutions of the
fragment. For instance, (4) (partially) describes the
intended resolution of the fragment in context (1)—
“John came to the party.”—, but it also describes for
example “Carl loves John.” or “Sandy thinks that
Kim relies on John.”, which can be resolutions in
other contexts.
It is important to note that unknown rel is not a
second order variable (as it would be in an approach
in the vein of (Dalrymple et al., 1991)), and it is not
something that simply gets replaced by a predicate
symbol of the same arity. Rather, unknown rel is a
constraint more like the =9-constraints, constrain-
ing the ‘shape’ of the described formulae. It is ana-
phoric, because the sub-formula that is to be inser-
ted at this point in the described formula is not de-
termined by the grammar, but must be provided by
the context.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.991169">
4.1 The Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995366">
Our grammatical analysis of fragments is relatively
straightforward: we make the assumption that frag-
ments are phrases,10 possibly modified by adverbs.
As (5) shows, only scopally modifying adverbs are
allowed.11

In a pseudo phrase-structure notation, the rules
simply are of the form ‘S-frag —&gt; (ADV) XP’. We
formalise this in a version of HPSG that allows con-
structions (Sag, 1997) (ie. phrase-types that make
a semantic contribution) and that uses MRSs as se-
mantic representations. HPSG-representations of
these semantic structures consist of a feature IN-
DEX whose value represents the semantic index of
the sign; a feature LTOP that holds the handle of the
sign, ie. a label for the bits of logical form intro-
duced by it; LZT, which is a bag of labelled EPs;

more complicated examples like ‘A: Does John devour
or nibble at his food? — B: Oh, John devours.’
11Note that the latter is licensed as an answer to a mul-
tiple wh-question like “Who sang, and how?”, in which
case we analyse it as a sequence of two fragments.

EP is contributed by the fragment-rule, via the fea-
ture C-CONT (construction content). In the same
way the unknown rel-constraint that was intro-
duced in the previous section is added. The con-
nection of this constraint to the semantics of the
phrase is made via co-indexation of the argument-
slot of unknown rel with the INDEX of the argu-
ment phrase (in Figure 1 this is 5).
As the type-declaration in Figure 1 shows, this
sign is the combination of two types, namely
headed-phrase, which is a general type that defines
the features and co-indexations in headed phrases;
and np-nm-decl-frag, which collects the specifica-
tions particular to fragments. This type in turn in-
herits from three further types: np-frag, which spe-
cifies the particularities of fragments consisting of
NPs; nm-frag, which specifies non-modified frag-
ments (ie., a phrase that is not modified by an ad-
verb); and decl-frag, which indicates that the frag-
ments resolves to a proposition. These three types
encapsulate properties of fragments that can vary
independently; see the hierarchy in Figure 2.
We assume a generalised head-feature principle
(ghfp) as in (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) according
to which all values for SYNSEM-features on the
mother are by default token-identical to those of the
daughter, and hence we have to make sure that the
fragment-types override this default where appro-
priate. For example, the value for SYNSEM.LOCAL
of fragments must be specified on the types for the
fragments, since it will always be different from
that of the head daughter—raising different XPs to
sentences is the whole point of the rule, and so the
default of the ghfp to copy these specifications must
be overridden. The value of SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT
will be the same for all types of fragments, namely
that of a sentence. In fact, the only elements of the
type instantiated in Figure 1 that are specific to NP-
fragments are the co-indexation of the INDEX of the
head (the NP) with the ARG of the unknown rel,
and the restriction that the phrase be an NP. So the
constraint unique to NP-fragments (ie., the specific-
ation of the type np-frag) is that shown in (6).
Figure 1 represents a non-modified fragment. In
fragments that are modified by an adverb, we
find an additional non-head-daughter, whose EP is
scoped in as sister to the unknown rel, as shown in
(7).

Finally, the last dimension organises the differences
in the type of message to which the fragment will
resolve. The example we have seen in Figure 1
was one of a propositional-fragment; fragmental
questions or requests only differ in the type of this
message-relation. To give an example, (8) shows

4.2 Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973321421052632">
We have implemented our analysis in a wide-
coverage HPSG, the English Resource Grammar
(ERG, see for example (Copestake and Flickinger,
2000));12 the implementation was evaluated us-
ing the grammar-profiling tool [incr tsdb()]
(Oepen and Flickinger, 1998). First, to test for
possible adverse effects on the analyses of full-
sentences, we ran a batch-parse of a test-suite of
full sentences, the CSLI-test-suite which is distrib-
uted with [incr tsdb()]. It consists of 1348
sentences, of which 961 are marked as syntactically
well-formed and 387 as ill-formed. Table 4 shows
a comparison of the original ERG with our extended
version containing the fragment rules, with respect
to the average number of parses per sentence.
12The implementation differs slightly from the analysis
described in the previous section: the ERG doesn’t make
use of defaults, and so we had to explicitly state what is
identical between mother and daughter and what isn’t.

ERG with the fragment-ERG
As these data show, the fragment rules introduce
some new ambiguity, but on average less than one
more parse per item. We conclude from this that
adding the fragment-rules doesn’t lead to an ex-
plosion of readings that would render the grammar
practically unusable. What this evaluation doesn’t
tell us, however, is whether the additional readings
(of what is meant to be full sentences) are erroneous
or not. The problem is that ‘fragmenthood’ is not a
syntactic criterion, and so some strings that can be
analysed as sentences can also be analysed as frag-
ments. E.g., “leave” can be both an imperative sen-
tence and a VP-fragment (e.g. in the context of the
question “What did John make Sandy do?”).
To test the coverage of our extended grammar,
we used parts of the annotated corpus described
in Section 2.2. In 4037 items we identified 369
fragments, of which our grammar correctly parsed
242 (= 65.5%). A detailed study of the frag-
ments that were not recognised showed that a use-
ful extension would be rules for handling fragments
of the form “CONJ XP”, eg. “and on Saturday.”;
including those would bring our coverage up to
82.6% of the corpus. This result is in the same
order of magnitude as what the original grammar
achieves on full sentences, and is in the range of
what the best wide-coverage grammars that provide
semantic representations at present can achieve.
However, although extending the grammar in this
way is straightforward it would lead to a dramatic
rise in the number of average parses, and so for
practical purposes we did not carry out such an ex-
tension here.

5.1 Theory
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999705407407407">
The final problem we have to address is how the
underspecified semantic representations that our
grammar produces for fragments are resolved con-
textually. For this, we use a theory of discourse
interpretation called SDRT (Asher and Lascarides,
2003). This theory attempts to enrich dynamic se-
mantics with techniques for encoding the contribu-
tion of pragmatics. One central notion of dynamic
semantics (eg. (Kamp and Reyle, 1993)) is the up-
date of a representation of the context with that of
new information; in SDRT, this update is depend-
ent on non-monotonic inferences over linguistic
and non-linguistic information. SDRT’s update-
operation is defined on descriptions like MRSs;
it simply adds constraints on the form of logical
forms. The inferred information that is most im-
portant for us is the speech act type (e.g. QAP,
Elabpp) that connects the new information to the
context; this is what we used to classify fragments
in Section 2.
These speech acts are computed via default rules;
to give an example, the rule for IQAP is shown be-
low. In this rules, (T, a, 0) means 0 is to be attached
to a with a rhetorical relation (a and 0 label bits of
content) where a is part of the discourse context T;
a :? means that a is an interrogative, and A &gt; B
means IfA then normally B:13

<listItem confidence="0.762404">
(9) IQAP: ((T„ a„Q) A a :?) &gt; IQAP(a„Q)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.974343615384615">
This rule stipulates that the default contribution of a
response to a question is to supply information from
which the questioner can infer an answer. Thus in-
ferences about speech acts, and hence about impli-
cit content and goals, can sometime be triggered (by
default) purely on the basis of sentence moods. For
13(Asher and Lascarides, 1998) shows that some rules
like this can be derived from a precise model of rational-
ity and cooperativity.
other speech acts, information about speaker-goals
might be required; however, the general principle is
to always minimise the need for such information.
We now address resolving the underspecification
indicated by unknown rel. In particular, we argue
that there are certain constraints on the form of
resolution-via-identity fragments which do not ap-
ply to resolution-via-inference fragments. We de-
rive these different constraints from a general dis-
course coherence principle, but before we come to
this, we have to show what these constraints are.
We begin with questions and answers like (1).
Intuitively, one can say that there is a ‘hole’ in
questions like (1) or (10), marked syntactically by
the wh-phrase and semantically by a variable (be
that bound by a A-operator, as in (Groenendijk and
Stokhof, 1984) or by a quantifier, as in the ERG).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990284">
(10) A: Who came to the party?
B: Not Sandy.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999265">
This initially suggests that to resolve the content of
the fragment, one could attempt to do syntactic re-
construction, ‘plugging’ the syntactic structure of
the fragment into the (syntactic) ‘hole’ in the ques-
tion (cf. (Morgan, 1973)). Unfortunately, as (Gin-
zburg and Sag, 2001) (henceforth G&amp;S) attest, such
a strategy fails for some cases; eg. for (10) above:
“*Not Sandy came to the party.”
On the other hand, G&amp;S also attest that a purely
semantic reconstruction, where the semantic rep-
resentation of the fragment is ‘plugged into’ the
(semantic) ‘hole’ in the question, is also unsatis-
factory. Certain grammatical idiosyncrasies seem
to persist beyond sentence boundaries. This can
be shown with example (11) (from G&amp;S, p.300).
Here the fragmental answers must be of the syn-
tactic category required by the verb in the question
(VP[bse] and VP[inf], respectively), even though
the semantic objects denoted by these VPs presum-
ably are of the same type.14

<bodyText confidence="0.995860833333333">
G&amp;S model this constraint by restricting short an-
swers to be syntactically parallel to the question
they answer. This however is too strict, as ex-
amples like (2) show, which is a short answer as
well but does not exhibit such ‘parallelism’. We
explain the observation in a less direct but more

general way. First of all, our theory is declarat-
ive: it describes the form of the preferred resolu-
tion (it’s the one that satisfies the coherence con-
straints of the rhetorical relations), but not neces-
sarily how it is generated. We assume as a gen-
eral discourse principle that resolutions which are
(semantic-)structurally very close must satisfy a
certain syntactic constraint which says that sub-
categorization requirements must be satisfied, too.
Hence our principle can rule out resolutions even if
they satisfy the semantic constraints (eg., it would
rule out the ‘wrong’ combination of questions and
answers in (11) above), in case they violate that syn-
tactic constraint. The difference between (1) and
(2) now is explained by different contextual require-
ments. In (2) there is another relation present be-
sides QAP, namely Explanation. The semantics of
this former relation (namely that 0 explains the pro-
positional content of a) puts additional semantic
constraints on the answer; the structural closeness
is not required, and hence the fragment is exempt
from the syntactic constraint.
For reasons of space, we simply sketch the the-
ory here, but we should stress that, following G&amp;S,
we also assume that certain syntactic information
persists beyond sentence boundaries.

5.2 Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997277777778">
We have partially implemented the theory described
here in a computer program (see also (Schlangen
and Lascarides, 2002)). The resolution of res-via-
id fragments is very straightforward to implement,
since for them all possibilities can be generated via
simple abstraction and functional application oper-
ations over the semantic representations. That of
res-via-inf fragments is more problematic, and we
have only implemented it for a very limited domain,
namely that of scheduling dialogues. In this do-
main, the discourse-plans are particularly simple,
and so we can specify the required axioms for reas-
oning with extra-linguistic information. Again we
can’t go into details here and only note that even
though we minimise the amount of extra-linguistic
information that is needed, resolution of res-via-inf
fragments is a demanding task and can be auto-
mated only for very restricted domains.

The idea that content is determined by coherence
relations is of course not new, and has been imple-
mented for example in (Hobbs et al., 1993), which
also mentions in passing the problem of resolving
fragments in context. However, this ‘Interpreta-
tion as Abduction’-theory (IAT) differs from our ap-
proach in a number of important aspects. First, un-
like IAT’s weighted abduction where conflict among
the clues to interpretation is handled by the ex-
traneous logical machinery of weights, in our the-
ory conflict is resolved automatically by the logical
consequence relation itself. Secondly, Hobbs et al.
don’t consider the syntactic constraints on the resol-
ution of fragments that we discussed above. In fact,
they seem to regard fragments as ‘syntactically-ill
formed utterances’, and so do not make a difference
between well-formed and ill-formed fragments. In
principle, further constraints could be added to the
ITA framework, but at the cost of having to re-assign
weights so that the results of inference are always as
intended, and no princples or regulations are given
in (Hobbs et al., 1993) about how to do this.
As mentioned in the introduction, (Ginzburg
and Sag, 2001) (henceforth G&amp;S) also offer a
non-modular approach to the resolution of short-
answers (and some other fragmental speech acts).
(12) shows a very schematic representation of their
approach.

A grammar rule specific to the use made of the frag-
ment (in (12) as an answer) directly projects NPs as
sentences, with parts of the sentential content com-
ing from a contextual feature QUD (question under
discussion). This grammar rule in one go checks
the syntactic constraints and constructs the intended
content of the fragment in its discourse context.
In our opinion, our compositional approach has
certain advantages. First, the grammatical analysis
of fragments is uniform; contextual variation in
their meaning is accounted for in the same way as
it is for other anaphoric phenomena, via inferences
underlying discourse update. This yields the second
advantage: resolving fragments is fully integrated
with resolving other kinds of underspecification (al-
though we have not shown this here; cf. (Schlan-
gen and Lascarides, 2002)). Third, the interac-
tion between grammar and pragmatics is straight-
forward: pragmatics enriches information coming
from the grammar. In G&amp;S’s approach the grammar
has to ‘decide’ on the speech act that has been per-
formed (the grammar-rules are specific for eg. an-
swering, clarification); something that is normally
seen to be a defeasible process. Hence, even in
G&amp;S’s approach a pragmatic module is required,
which then has the task of filtering out unwanted
parses. Fourth, we have available a strong theory
of contextual interpretation which can explain the
reasoning behind the resolution of examples like (2)
(although we have not shown here in detail how);
the functional application used by G&amp;S seems too
weak to do this. Fifth, our compositional approach
allowed us to straightforwardly extend an existing
wide-coverage grammar. This contrasts with the
non-compositional approach which through its de-
mands for making contextual information available
entails that standard parsers cannot be used without
modifications. Lastly, the separation of the gram-
mar and resolution components means that in the-
ory our grammar can be used with different resolu-
tion strategies; however, we have not systematically
explored that.
As mentioned in the introduction, (Carberry,
1990) offers an approach that uses plan-recognition
techniques to resolve fragments. While such an
approach can perhaps model res-via-inf cases, it
seems to us needlessy powerful for fragment-types
like (1), where purely linguistic information is suf-
ficient. Moreover, Carberry does not deal with the
syntactic constraints and so overgenerates possible
fragments.

7 Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.999952466666667">
We draw the following conclusions from the work
presented in this paper: fragments occur frequently
in dialogues, namely relatively consistently around
10% across dialogue types (but possibly more fre-
quently in question/answer-based informative dia-
logues). This means that a principled approach to
their resolution is important for natural sounding
dialogue systems, besides being of theoretical in-
terest. We have offered such an approach, begin-
ning with a comprehensive taxonomy of fragment-
types, through to a semantic and syntactic analysis,
which we also implemented. In that implementa-
tion we identified for future work the sub-type of
fragments of the form ‘CONJ XP’ (eg. “and on
Monday.”).

However, although extending the grammar in this way is straightforward it would lead to a dramatic rise in the number of average parses, and so for practical purposes we did not carry out such an extension here. 5.1 Theory The final problem we have to address is how the underspecified semantic representations that our grammar produces for fragments are resolved contextually. For this, we use a theory of discourse interpretation called SDRT (Asher and Lascarides, 2003). This theory attempts to enrich dynamic semantics with techniques for encoding the contribution of pragmatics. One central notion of dynamic semantics (eg. (Kamp and Reyle, 1993)) is the update of a representation of the context with that of new information; in SDRT, this update is dependent on non-monotonic inferences over linguistic and non-linguistic information. SDRT’s updateoperation is defined on descriptions like MRSs; it simply adds constraints on the form of logical forms. The inferred information that is most important for us is the speech act type (e.g. QAP, Elabpp) that connects t</context>

The main thesis of our approach is that the resolution of the intended content of fragments can be modelled as a by-product of the establishment of coherence in dialogue, which (following much of the work on discourse) we define as the establishment of a meaningful connection of the content of the current utterance to its discourse context. We will show that the constraints on the form and content of fragments follow from such connections. There has recently been some renewed interest in fragments. For example, (Carberry, 1990) offers an approach where computationally expensive plan-recognition techniques are employed for their interpretation. As we will show, this fails to predict certain empirical facts and further, we will show that the complex reasoning with cognitive states that she employs can often be replaced with much simpler inferences based on linguistic information.

Fifth, our compositional approach allowed us to straightforwardly extend an existing wide-coverage grammar. This contrasts with the non-compositional approach which through its demands for making contextual information available entails that standard parsers cannot be used without modifications. Lastly, the separation of the grammar and resolution components means that in theory our grammar can be used with different resolution strategies; however, we have not systematically explored that. As mentioned in the introduction, (Carberry, 1990) offers an approach that uses plan-recognition techniques to resolve fragments. While such an approach can perhaps model res-via-inf cases, it seems to us needlessy powerful for fragment-types like (1), where purely linguistic information is sufficient. Moreover, Carberry does not deal with the syntactic constraints and so overgenerates possible fragments. 7 Conclusions We draw the following conclusions from the work presented in this paper: fragments occur frequently in dialogues, namely relatively consistently around 10% across dialogue types (but possibly more frequently in question/answer-</context>

In conclusion, we think that this corpus study has shown that our taxonomy has satisfactory empirical motivation. In the next two sections we look at fragments in isolation. We return to the taxonomy when we give an example of the formal semantics of relations and show how they determine the resolution of the fragments. 3 A Compositional Semantics for Fragments For compositional semantic analysis we use Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS, (Copestake et al., 1999)), a language in which partial descriptions of formulae of a logical language (the base language) can be expressed. This allows one to leave certain semantic distinctions unresolved, reflecting the idea that syntax supplies only partial information about meaning. Technically this is achieved via a strategy that has become standard in computational semantics (e.g., (Reyle, 1993)): one assigns labels to bits of base language formulae so that statements about their combination can remain ‘underspecified’. The (first-order) models of formulae of this latter language then can be seen as standing in</context>

For instance, (4) (partially) describes the intended resolution of the fragment in context (1)— “John came to the party.”—, but it also describes for example “Carl loves John.” or “Sandy thinks that Kim relies on John.”, which can be resolutions in other contexts. It is important to note that unknown rel is not a second order variable (as it would be in an approach in the vein of (Dalrymple et al., 1991)), and it is not something that simply gets replaced by a predicate symbol of the same arity. Rather, unknown rel is a constraint more like the =9-constraints, constraining the ‘shape’ of the described formulae. It is anaphoric, because the sub-formula that is to be inserted at this point in the described formula is not determined by the grammar, but must be provided by the context. 4 A Grammar of Fragments 4.1 The Analysis Our grammatical analysis of fragments is relatively straightforward: we make the assumption that fragments are phrases,10 possibly modified by adverbs.

This type in turn inherits from three further types: np-frag, which specifies the particularities of fragments consisting of NPs; nm-frag, which specifies non-modified fragments (ie., a phrase that is not modified by an adverb); and decl-frag, which indicates that the fragments resolves to a proposition. These three types encapsulate properties of fragments that can vary independently; see the hierarchy in Figure 2. We assume a generalised head-feature principle (ghfp) as in (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) according to which all values for SYNSEM-features on the mother are by default token-identical to those of the daughter, and hence we have to make sure that the fragment-types override this default where appropriate. For example, the value for SYNSEM.LOCAL of fragments must be specified on the types for the fragments, since it will always be different from that of the head daughter—raising different XPs to sentences is the whole point of the rule, and so the default of the ghfp to copy these specifications must be overridden.

(10) A: Who came to the party? B: Not Sandy. This initially suggests that to resolve the content of the fragment, one could attempt to do syntactic reconstruction, ‘plugging’ the syntactic structure of the fragment into the (syntactic) ‘hole’ in the question (cf.

Certain grammatical idiosyncrasies seem to persist beyond sentence boundaries. This can be shown with example (11) (from G&amp;S, p.300).

Secondly, Hobbs et al. don’t consider the syntactic constraints on the resolution of fragments that we discussed above. In fact, they seem to regard fragments as ‘syntactically-ill formed utterances’, and so do not make a difference between well-formed and ill-formed fragments. In principle, further constraints could be added to the ITA framework, but at the cost of having to re-assign weights so that the results of inference are always as intended, and no princples or regulations are given in (Hobbs et al., 1993) about how to do this. As mentioned in the introduction, (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) (henceforth G&amp;S) also offer a non-modular approach to the resolution of shortanswers (and some other fragmental speech acts).

Again we can’t go into details here and only note that even though we minimise the amount of extra-linguistic information that is needed, resolution of res-via-inf fragments is a demanding task and can be automated only for very restricted domains. 6 Related Work The idea that content is determined by coherence relations is of course not new, and has been implemented for example in (Hobbs et al., 1993), which also mentions in passing the problem of resolving fragments in context. However, this ‘Interpretation as Abduction’-theory (IAT) differs from our approach in a number of important aspects. First, unlike IAT’s weighted abduction where conflict among the clues to interpretation is handled by the extraneous logical machinery of weights, in our theory conflict is resolved automatically by the logical consequence relation itself.

For this, we use a theory of discourse interpretation called SDRT (Asher and Lascarides, 2003). This theory attempts to enrich dynamic semantics with techniques for encoding the contribution of pragmatics. One central notion of dynamic semantics (eg. (Kamp and Reyle, 1993)) is the update of a representation of the context with that of new information; in SDRT, this update is dependent on non-monotonic inferences over linguistic and non-linguistic information. SDRT’s updateoperation is defined on descriptions like MRSs; it simply adds constraints on the form of logical forms. The inferred information that is most important for us is the speech act type (e.g. QAP, Elabpp) that connects the new information to the context; this is what we used to classify fragments in Section 2. These speech acts are computed via default rules; to give an example, the rule for IQAP</context>

We also briefly describe an implementation of this theory, and quantify the potential practical use of handling fragments in dialogue systems. 1 Introduction In dialogue settings, people frequently produce utterances which, despite being non-sentential, convey propositions, questions or requests. For instance, B’s utterance in (1) of the NP “John” conveys in this context the proposition “John came to the party.” (1) A: Who came to the party? B: John. Clearly, the interpretation of such non-sentential utterances or fragments, as they are traditionally called (eg. (Morgan, 1973)) is highly context dependent.

This allows one to leave certain semantic distinctions unresolved, reflecting the idea that syntax supplies only partial information about meaning. Technically this is achieved via a strategy that has become standard in computational semantics (e.g., (Reyle, 1993)): one assigns labels to bits of base language formulae so that statements about their combination can remain ‘underspecified’. The (first-order) models of formulae of this latter language then can be seen as standing in a direct relation to formulae of the base language; M �= 0 then means that the (unique) base-language formula corresponding to M is described by the MRS 0.8 By way of example, (3) shows an MRSrepresentation of “Everyone loves someone”, where so-called elementary predications (EPs) are labelled with handles (hn), with h being the top handle that outscopes all others; ‘h1 =q h2’</context>

The semantics of this former relation (namely that 0 explains the propositional content of a) puts additional semantic constraints on the answer; the structural closeness is not required, and hence the fragment is exempt from the syntactic constraint. For reasons of space, we simply sketch the theory here, but we should stress that, following G&amp;S, we also assume that certain syntactic information persists beyond sentence boundaries. 5.2 Implementation We have partially implemented the theory described here in a computer program (see also (Schlangen and Lascarides, 2002)). The resolution of res-viaid fragments is very straightforward to implement, since for them all possibilities can be generated via simple abstraction and functional application operations over the semantic representations. That of res-via-inf fragments is more problematic, and we have only implemented it for a very limited domain, namely that of scheduling dialogues. In this domain, the discourse-plans are particularly simple, and so we can specify the required axioms for reasoning with extra-linguistic information. Again we can’t go into details here and only note that even though we minimi</context>

This grammar rule in one go checks the syntactic constraints and constructs the intended content of the fragment in its discourse context. In our opinion, our compositional approach has certain advantages. First, the grammatical analysis of fragments is uniform; contextual variation in their meaning is accounted for in the same way as it is for other anaphoric phenomena, via inferences underlying discourse update. This yields the second advantage: resolving fragments is fully integrated with resolving other kinds of underspecification (although we have not shown this here; cf. (Schlangen and Lascarides, 2002)). Third, the interaction between grammar and pragmatics is straightforward: pragmatics enriches information coming from the grammar. In G&amp;S’s approach the grammar has to ‘decide’ on the speech act that has been performed (the grammar-rules are specific for eg. answering, clarification); something that is normally seen to be a defeasible process. Hence, even in G&amp;S’s approach a pragmatic module is required, which then has the task of filtering out unwanted parses. Fourth, we have available a strong theory of contextual interpretation which can explain the reasoning behind the resolution of exa</context>

SUMMARY items analysed 9142 Fragments 931 (= 10.2%) classfd. 865 (= 93% of fragments) other 66 (= 7% of fragments) Table 3: Results of Annotation Discussion The overall percentage of fragments we have found seems to confirm the results of earlier studies (Thompson, 1980; Fern´andez and Ginzburg, 2002), which also classified as fragments around 10% of the utterances in the dialogues they looked at. (Fern´andez and Ginzburg, 2002) also offers a taxonomy of fragment types; the authors claim to have reached a coverage which is much higher than what we achieved (99% compared to our 93%). We think this can partially be explained by the fact that the classes they use are more surface-oriented. For example, they have a class ‘sluice’, which is defined as “bare questiondenoting wh-phrases” (Fern´andez and Ginzburg, 2002, p.16). We make a finer distinction, splitting </context>
