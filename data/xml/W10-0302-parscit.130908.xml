The exponential growth of the Persian blo-
gosphere and the increased number of neolog-
isms create a major challenge in NLP
applications of Persian blogs. This paper de-
scribes a method for extracting and classifying
newly constructed words and borrowings from
Persian blog posts. The analysis of the occur-
rence of neologisms across five distinct topic
categories points to a correspondence between
the topic domain and the type of neologism
that is most commonly encountered. The re-
sults suggest that different approaches should
be implemented for the automatic detection
and processing of neologisms depending on
the domain of application.

<bodyText confidence="0.994599145833333">
Since its beginnings in 2001, the Persian blogos-
phere has undergone a dramatic growth making
Persian one of the top ten languages of the global
blog community in 2007 [Sifry 2007].
One of the main challenges in the automatic
analysis and processing of Persian language blogs
is the accelerated emergence of neologisms in on-
line discourse. These newly created words that
cannot be found in traditional lexicons primarily
consist of adopted English loanwords, such as zjhlz
dânlod ‘download’ or DixU ânlâyn ‘online’, and
innovative constructions based on Persian word-

sian language blogs supported by a Mission-Oriented Investi-
gation and Experimentation (MOIE) program at MITRE.
formation principles, as in D5-1.;4 filtershekan ‘an-
ti-filter software’ or ci chatidan ‘to chat’.
In this paper, we investigate the distinct classes
of neologisms encountered in Persian language
blogs. Since the main goal of the project is to build
a topic classification system for blogs, we focused
on extracting neologisms that would have the most
discriminatory power in distinguishing between the
various classes.
For the purposes of this study, we collected a
corpus of Persian language blogs from five differ-
ent topic categories of sports, medicine, politics,
Internet, and cinema. The neologisms are automat-
ically extracted by running the documents through
a morphological analyzer. Since these new word
coinages are not recognized by the analyzer, they
are tagged as unknowns. A weight-ordered list of
unknown words is then generated for each topic
category, using information gain as the measure, as
described in Section 2.3. The more significant neo-
logisms for each category are then manually identi-
fied from the generated weight-ordered lists,
focusing on the top 200 words, and classified
based on their linguistic characteristics. The results
indicate that the type of neologism found in the
blog posts in fact corresponds to the topic domain.
Hence, for example, while English loans are highly
prominent in technical and Internet related posts,
new morphological constructions are more com-
mon in the domain of politics. Building on these
results, we argue that distinct approaches are re-
quired for processing the adopted loan words and
the morphologically constructed neologisms.

The blog data for this study comes from Blogfa1, a
popular Persian blog hosting site. The topic index
provided by Blogfa itself has allowed us to rapidly
collect large amounts of blog data coming from
topic categories of interest, by eliminating the need
to manually label the data. Table 1 provides a list
of the five topic categories used in this study, as
well as the total number and the median size of the
collected blogs for each. The table also includes
the average number of words in each topic catego-
ry. The blogs were collected in February 2010,
starting with the most recent blog posted in each
topic and moving back chronologically.

2.2 Linguistic Parsing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962375">
The collected documents are run through a Persian
morphological parser that analyzes all word forms
including compounds and provides a part of speech
tag for the valid analyses [Amtrup 2003]. The
morphological analyzer was developed for use in a
Persian-English machine translation system and
provides part of speech as well as all syntactically
relevant inflectional features for a word [cf. Me-
gerdoomian 2000]. The morphological formalism
consists of a declarative description of rules utiliz-
ing typed feature structures with unification. The
morphological analysis component takes advantage
of a lexicon of about 40,000 entries in citation
form that had been developed in the period of
1999-2002 for coverage of online news articles and
includes nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs and

<bodyText confidence="0.985866166666666">
closed class items. In addition, there are about
5,000 common proper noun entities listed in the
lexicon. After morphological analysis, dictionary
lookup eliminates all erroneous analyses. Any
element that is not successfully associated with a
word in the lexicon is tagged as an unknown.
The current morphological analyzer has a cover-
age of 97% and an accuracy of 93% on a 7MB
corpus collected from online news sources. The
system fails to analyze conversational forms. Other
unanalyzed tokens are mainly proper nouns and
words missing in the lexicon.

2.3 Information Gain
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997268909090909">
To automatically detect the most pertinent un-
known terms per blog category, we employ an in-
formation gain (IG) based feature selection
approach. IG’s effectiveness as a feature selection
measure for text topic categorization, the ultimate
objective of this project, has been well studied
[Yang and Pedersen 1997].
Information gain is a statistical measure for cal-
culating the expected reduction in entropy [Mit-
chell 1997]. Entropy, a common measure in
information theory, captures the impurity of a col-
lection of examples relative to the intended classi-
fication. For a binary classification task, the
entropy of a set of examples E is defined as:
where is the proportion of positive examples
and is the proportion of negative examples in
E. Moreover, it is assumed that is equal
to zero. The discriminatory power of an attribute
for a given class can then be measured by IG,
which is the reduction in entropy caused by the
partitioning of the data using that attribute. The IG
for example set E and attribute A is defined as:

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996122666666667">
where Values(A) represents the set of all possible
values that attribute A can take on and is the set
of examples for which attribute A takes on value v.
In this study, each attribute has a binary value
which signifies the presence or absence of a given
unknown term in the document. So for the purpos-

es of this study, the above equation can be formu-
lated as:

term, Dt is the set of documents in which term t
occurs, and is the set of documents in which
term t does not occur.

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998932">
Since the aim of feature selection for this paper
is that of identifying the most pertinent unknown
terms for each topic category, an additional con-
straint is imposed on the feature selection process.
Here, for a term to be selected, it not only needs to
have a high IG, but it needs to be present in a high-
er proportion of positive examples than the nega-
tive ones. This prevents the selection of terms that
while are good descriptors of the negative class
and thus carry a high IG, are not necessarily perti-
nent to the positive class (i.e., the topic category
under consideration). So IG of a term not meeting
the above constraint is effectively set to zero.
As indicated previously, the 200 unknown
terms with the highest IG for each topic category
are thus selected for the analysis portion of this
study. Table 2 depicts a sample set of the top
weighted terms for the Internet category in transli-
teration and translation. The transliteration schema
was designed to display the results of the morpho-
logical analyzer system. It directly represents the
Persian script and provides a bijective, one-to-one
mapping of the characters. The transliteration
omits any diacritics, including vowels, that are not
represented in the original script.

The weight-ordered list of unknown words pro-
vides a candidate list of potential neologisms.
However, the set of unknown terms extracted from
each topic category includes proper names, spel-
ling errors, conversational language forms and
neologisms. We therefore manually study the can-
didate list in order to identify the appropriate
classes of neologisms. The results are classified
based on the observed linguistic characteristics and
a quantitative analysis is performed for each topic
category.

3 Neologism Classification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994224375">
Persian language blogs include a large number of
neologisms ranging from new usages in conversa-
tional language to newly coined words to designate
new technology or political concepts. We per-
formed a qualitative, linguistic investigation of
Persian language blogs, consisting of posts from
four main categories of technical, political, arts,
and personal diary [Megerdoomian 2008]. The
goal of this study was to identify elements of Per-
sian Blogspeak that indicate language change and
which fail to be analyzed by the existing Persian
machine translation and information extraction
systems that had been developed for online news
sources. The study pointed to four main categories
of new word formation found in Persian language
blogs:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99997">
• Borrowings (mainly from English and
French)
• Compounding
• Affixation
• Conversion: Semantic and functional shift
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989475">
These neologisms were identified based on the
prevalent linguistic classification of newly formed
words (see for instance the classification of neo-
logisms described in [Grzega and Schoener 2007]).

<bodyText confidence="0.989418142857143">
A large number of new loan words can be found in
blogs. Although they may sometimes be inserted
within the text in the original language, they are
generally transcribed into Persian script. These
loans are used as regular words and can take Per-
sian inflectional affixes. Some examples are pro-
vided in Table 3.

Table 3 – Loan words in Persian blogs
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999494461538462">
An analysis of the occurrence of loans with re-
spect to the various topic domains shows that the
Internet category contains a large number of Eng-
lish language loans, whereas the more established
scientific domain of medicine tends to use French
borrowings. Also within the same category, new
technological or scientific additions are generally
expressed in English. For instance, in the cinema
category, most technical words are of French ori-
gin – e.g., ىارکا from écran ‘screen’ or ژارتیت from
titrage ‘opening credits’. However, new loans have
entered the field from English, e.g., يشیویًا animey-
shen ‘animation’.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99918">
3.2 Compounding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99513090625">
Compounding is a productive word-formation
process in Persian and refers to cases where two or
more roots are combined to form a new word. Ex-
amples of compounding include راکهار râhkâr
(consisting of râh ‘path’ and kâr ‘work’ and now
being used to mean ‘guideline’ or ‘solution’);
گربرس sarbarg (from sar ‘head’ and barg ‘leaf,
piece of paper’ signifying ‘letterhead’); and شابرگد
degarbâsh (formed with degar ‘other’ and bâsh
‘being’, meaning ‘queer’). In many cases, howev-
er, one of the roots is a borrowing that is combined
with a Persian root form. Examples of this multi-
lingual compounding construction include یزاسىبات
tâbusâzi (taboo + to make) ‘making taboo’ and
یًودکٌیل linkduni (link + storage) meaning ‘blo-
groll’.
Recently, there has been a concerted effort by
the Persian Language Academy to replace borrow-
ings from foreign languages by equivalent Persian
constructions. Thus, the traditional رتپىکیله helikop-
ter ‘helicopter’ has been replaced by درگلاب bâlgard
by combining Persian bâl ‘wing’ and gard ‘turn’.
Similarly, the French loanword ىیراٌس senâryo
‘screenplay’ is now being replaced by ههاٌولیف
filmnâmé composed of film and nâmé ‘letter,
book’.
Persian has a very productive compounding
strategy for forming new verbs where a nominal or
adjectival root is combined with a light verb, i.e., a
verb that has lost some of its semantic value. Many
new verbs, especially in the technical domain, are
formed following this construction as illustrated in

3.3 Affixation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998187611111111">
New words are often created following a produc-
tive word-formation pattern using suffixes. For
instance, the agentive suffix –gar is used to form
رگروره morurgar ‘browser’ by combining with
morur ‘review’, and رگ هٌتف fetne-gar ‘seditious’
when combined with fetne ‘sedition’2. Another
common affix used to form new words is –estân
which indicates a place. This suffix can be found in
terms like ىاتسگلابو veblâgestân (weblog + -stan)
‘blogosphere’ or ىاتسکٌیل linkestân (link + -stan)
‘blogroll’.
In addition to the compound verb formation,
bloggers have started creating simple verbs by
combining the verbal ending –idan with nominal
2 Fetne-gar is a relatively new creation that is used alongside
the traditional fetne-ju ‘seditious’. There is a clear sense
among native speakers, however, that fetne-gar refers to a
person who is more agentive, actively causing discord.

speech category may also shift. One example is the
adjective -!Lu shafâf ‘transparent’ that is being
used more and more frequently as an adverb in
political contexts with the meaning ‘openly, trans-
parently’.
This category, however, is difficult to detect au-
tomatically with the methodology used since these
words already exist in traditional lexicons and are
not tagged as unknowns by the morphological
parser. Identifying conversions and semantic shifts
currently requires a manual exploration of the data;
topic domain.
Starting from the weight-ordered candidate list
for each topic category, we manually examined
and labeled each unknown word according to the
neologism classification described in Section 3. In
order to identify the correct class, each unknown
word was considered within its context of occur-
rence in the corresponding blog posts and classi-
fied according to the usage within the sentence. In
addition, proper names, conversational forms of
existing words, and spelling errors were tagged
separately.

Figure 1 illustrates the correspondence of the
number of borrowings per topic category in the
corresponding candidate list. The results show that
the most common way of forming new words with-
in blogs dealing with Internet and computer tech-
nology is to use borrowings from English. In the
medical domain, however, most neologisms are
scientific terms borrowed mainly from the French
language. The domain of cinema and theatre also
includes a large number of loans from French.
However, most of the French loans across topics
seem to be older borrowings while the newer loans
(i.e, within the last three to five years) are almost
always from the English language. A statistical
analysis of the results indicate that these corres-
pondences are significant as shown in Figure 2 for
English loans and in Figure 3 for French loans.
Figure 2 illustrates a pairwise comparison between
the Internet category and other blog topics based
on the average percentage of documents in which a
given term from the English loan neologism cate-
gory is included. (*) indicates a statistically signif-
icant difference between the two percentages.

comparison between the Medical category and oth-
er topics for the French loan class.

Figure 4 shows the relative usage of affixation
and compounding strategies for the creation of new
words. Although affixation is used to some degree
in both the Internet and medical domains, they do
not occur as often as the English or French loans
(cf. Figure 1 above). Interestingly, the blogs that
fall within the political topic category do not make
much use of borrowings from English and French.
Instead, they tend to create new words by applying
productive affixation and compounding strategies.
In most instances, the words used to form neolog-
isms in the politics category are based on words of
Arabic and Persian origin. Figure 5 illustrates the
pairwise comparison between the Political and oth-
er blog topics based on the average percentage of
documents in which a given term from the affixa-
tion and compounding class of neologisms is in-
cluded. (*) indicates a statistically significant
difference between the two percentages.
Hence, while the Internet blogs make heavy use
of English loans in the creation of new words, po-
litical blogs tend to use affixation and compound
strategies for word-formation. These results sug-

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997542857143">
This paper presents an investigation of neolog-
isms in Persian blog posts across five distinct topic
areas. We employ morphological analysis in con-
junction with a profile-based classification tech-
nique to successfully extract a pertinent candidate
list for identifying new word-level constructions in
blogs. These neologisms are then classified based
on their linguistic characteristics and word-
formation strategies and the quantitative analysis
points to a significant correspondence between
neologism classes and blog topic domains.
Based on these results, we propose that the de-
tection and processing strategies should be tailored
to the domain of the NLP application for greater
efficiency. In particular, a derivational morpholog-
ical system can be developed by implementing the
productive affixation and compounding rules used
in Persian word formation. This system can be
used to extend the existing analysis and translation
systems in the domain of politics. Loans from Eng-
lish, on the other hand, can be automatically
processed by using previously implemented me-
thodologies for transcribing Persian script into the
English writing system [Megerdoomian 2006, Jo-
hanson 2007]. Such a system would be beneficial
in recognizing the large number of loans encoun-
tered in the technical and scientific domains.
This work is part of a larger project for automat-
ic topic classification and sentiment analysis in
Persian language blogs. We extract the most perti-
nent neologisms encountered in the blog corpus in
order to enhance the topic classification system. In
addition, the results obtained will be used to extend
the current morphological parser to improve cover-
age and identification of newly formed words.

<abstract confidence="0.987624423625255">The exponential growth of the Persian blogosphere and the increased number of neologisms create a major challenge in NLP applications of Persian blogs. This paper describes a method for extracting and classifying newly constructed words and borrowings from Persian blog posts. The analysis of the occurof neologisms across topic categories points to a correspondence between the topic domain and the type of neologism that is most commonly encountered. The results suggest that different approaches should be implemented for the automatic detection and processing of neologisms depending on the domain of application. Since its beginnings in 2001, the Persian blogosphere has undergone a dramatic growth making Persian one of the top ten languages of the global blog community in 2007 [Sifry 2007]. One of the main challenges in the automatic analysis and processing of Persian language blogs is the accelerated emergence of neologisms in online discourse. These newly created words that cannot be found in traditional lexicons primarily of adopted English loanwords, such as or and constructions based on Persian wordresearch is part of a larger project on the study of Persian language blogs supported by a Mission-Oriented Investigation and Experimentation (MOIE) program at MITRE. principles, as in software’ or In this paper, we investigate the distinct classes of neologisms encountered in Persian language blogs. Since the main goal of the project is to build a topic classification system for blogs, we focused on extracting neologisms that would have the most discriminatory power in distinguishing between the various classes. For the purposes of this study, we collected a corpus of Persian language blogs from five different topic categories of sports, medicine, politics, Internet, and cinema. The neologisms are automatically extracted by running the documents through a morphological analyzer. Since these new word coinages are not recognized by the analyzer, they are tagged as unknowns. A weight-ordered list of unknown words is then generated for each topic category, using information gain as the measure, as described in Section 2.3. The more significant neologisms for each category are then manually identified from the generated weight-ordered lists, focusing on the top 200 words, and classified based on their linguistic characteristics. The results indicate that the type of neologism found in the blog posts in fact corresponds to the topic domain. Hence, for example, while English loans are highly prominent in technical and Internet related posts, new morphological constructions are more common in the domain of politics. Building on these results, we argue that distinct approaches are required for processing the adopted loan words and the morphologically constructed neologisms. 6 of the NAACL HLT 2010 Second Workshop on Computational Approaches to Linguistic pages Angeles, California, June 2010. Association for Computational Linguistics 2 Extraction Process 2.1 Blog Data blog data for this study comes from a popular Persian blog hosting site. The topic index provided by Blogfa itself has allowed us to rapidly collect large amounts of blog data coming from topic categories of interest, by eliminating the need to manually label the data. Table 1 provides a list of the five topic categories used in this study, as well as the total number and the median size of the collected blogs for each. The table also includes the average number of words in each topic category. The blogs were collected in February 2010, starting with the most recent blog posted in each topic and moving back chronologically. topic category # of blogs median size average Internet 497 14 kb 986 Cinema and theatre va 255 18 kb 1380 Political 500 22 kb 2171 Medical 499 27 kb 2285 Sports 498 19 kb 1528 1 categories of interest and the total number, median size, and average length of the collected blogs for each topic 2.2 Linguistic Parsing The collected documents are run through a Persian morphological parser that analyzes all word forms including compounds and provides a part of speech tag for the valid analyses [Amtrup 2003]. The morphological analyzer was developed for use in a Persian-English machine translation system and provides part of speech as well as all syntactically relevant inflectional features for a word [cf. Megerdoomian 2000]. The morphological formalism consists of a declarative description of rules utilizing typed feature structures with unification. The morphological analysis component takes advantage of a lexicon of about 40,000 entries in citation form that had been developed in the period of 1999-2002 for coverage of online news articles and includes nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs and closed class items. In addition, there are about 5,000 common proper noun entities listed in the lexicon. After morphological analysis, dictionary lookup eliminates all erroneous analyses. Any element that is not successfully associated with a word in the lexicon is tagged as an unknown. The current morphological analyzer has a coverage of 97% and an accuracy of 93% on a 7MB corpus collected from online news sources. The system fails to analyze conversational forms. Other unanalyzed tokens are mainly proper nouns and words missing in the lexicon. 2.3 Information Gain To automatically detect the most pertinent unterms per blog category, we employ an ingain based feature selection approach. IG’s effectiveness as a feature selection measure for text topic categorization, the ultimate objective of this project, has been well studied [Yang and Pedersen 1997]. Information gain is a statistical measure for calthe expected reduction in [Mitchell 1997]. Entropy, a common measure in information theory, captures the impurity of a collection of examples relative to the intended classification. For a binary classification task, the of a set of examples defined as: where is the proportion of positive examples and is the proportion of negative examples in Moreover, it is assumed that is equal to zero. The discriminatory power of an attribute for a given class can then be measured by IG, which is the reduction in entropy caused by the partitioning of the data using that attribute. The IG example set attribute defined as: E A Entropy EE , ) ) Values A ) represents the set of all possible that attribute take on and is the set examples for which attribute on value In this study, each attribute has a binary value which signifies the presence or absence of a given term in the document. So for the purpos- E vEntropy(E v ) E 7 es of this study, the above equation can be formulated as: the set of all documents, a given the set of documents in which term occurs, and is the set of documents in which not occur.

Here, for a term to be selected, it not only needs to have a high IG, but it needs to be present in a higher proportion of positive examples than the negative ones. This prevents the selection of terms that while are good descriptors of the negative class and thus carry a high IG, are not necessarily pertinent to the positive class (i.e., the topic category under consideration). So IG of a term not meeting the above constraint is effectively set to zero. As indicated previously, the 200 unknown terms with the highest IG for each topic category are thus selected for the analysis portion of this study. Table 2 depicts a sample set of the top weighted terms for the Internet category in transliteration and translation. The transliteration schema was designed to display the results of the morphological analyzer system. It directly represents the Persian script and provides a bijective, one-to-one mapping of the characters. The transliteration omits any diacritics, including vowels, that are not represented in the original script. 2.4 Candidate List The weight-ordered list of unknown words provides a candidate list of potential neologisms. However, the set of unknown terms extracted from each topic category includes proper names, spelling errors, conversational language forms and neologisms. We therefore manually study the candidate list in order to identify the appropriate classes of neologisms. The results are classified based on the observed linguistic characteristics and a quantitative analysis is performed for each topic category. 3 Neologism Classification Persian language blogs include a large number of neologisms ranging from new usages in conversational language to newly coined words to designate new technology or political concepts. We performed a qualitative, linguistic investigation of Persian language blogs, consisting of posts from four main categories of technical, political, arts, and personal diary [Megerdoomian 2008]. The goal of this study was to identify elements of Persian Blogspeak that indicate language change and which fail to be analyzed by the existing Persian machine translation and information extraction systems that had been developed for online news sources. The study pointed to four main categories of new word formation found in Persian language blogs: • Borrowings (mainly from English and French) • Compounding • Affixation • Conversion: Semantic and functional shift These neologisms were identified based on the prevalent linguistic classification of newly formed words (see for instance the classification of neologisms described in [Grzega and Schoener 2007]). 8 These four classes of neologisms are described in more detail in the rest of this section. 3.1 Borrowings A large number of new loan words can be found in blogs. Although they may sometimes be inserted within the text in the original language, they are generally transcribed into Persian script. These loans are used as regular words and can take Persian inflectional affixes. Some examples are provided in Table 3.

Also within the same category, new technological or scientific additions are generally expressed in English. For instance, in the cinema category, most technical words are of French orior credits’. new loans have the field from English, e.g., animey- 3.2 Compounding Compounding is a productive word-formation process in Persian and refers to cases where two or more roots are combined to form a new word. Exof compounding include of and and used to mean ‘guideline’ or and of paper’ signifying and with and meaning In many cases, however, one of the roots is a borrowing that is combined with a Persian root form. Examples of this multicompounding construction include + to make) taboo’ and + storage) meaning Recently, there has been a concerted effort by the Persian Language Academy to replace borrowings from foreign languages by equivalent Persian Thus, the traditional helikophas been replaced by درگلاب combining Persian and the French loanword ‘screenplay’ is now being replaced by ههاٌولیف of book’. Persian has a very productive compounding strategy for forming new verbs where a nominal or adjectival root is combined with a light verb, i.e., a verb that has lost some of its semantic value. Many new verbs, especially in the technical domain, are formed following this construction as illustrated in Persian Transcription Translation ىدرک کیلک kelik kardan to click ىدرک تچ chat kardan to chat ىدز سا ما سا es-em-es zadan to send a text message ىدش لسٌک kansel shodan to be cancelled 4 verb formation 3.3 Affixation New words are often created following a productive word-formation pattern using suffixes. For the agentive suffix used to form combining with هٌتف combined with Another affix used to form new words is which indicates a place. This suffix can be found in like + or + In addition to the compound verb formation, bloggers have started creating simple verbs by the verbal ending nominal a relatively new creation that is used alongside traditional There is a clear sense native speakers, however, that to a person who is more agentive, actively causing discord. 9 as in chat’ or �4Y ‘to blog’. we leave a study of this class of neologisms for future work. 3.4 Conversion Another type of neologism found in Persian language blogs consists of existing words that are being used in a new context, bringing about a 4 Topic and Neologism Correspondence An investigation of the neologisms for each topic category clearly suggests that there is a close relationship between the class of neologisms and the 1 neologisms across topic categories 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 count Loan English Transliterated Loan French Transliterated Internet Cinema Medical Political Sport semantic shift. In certain instances, the part-ofspeech category may also shift. One example is the that is used more and more frequently as an adverb in contexts with the ‘openly, parently’. This category, however, is difficult to detect automatically with the methodology used since these words already exist in traditional lexicons and are not tagged as unknowns by the morphological parser. Identifying conversions and semantic shifts currently requires a manual exploration of the data; topic domain. Starting from the weight-ordered candidate list for each topic category, we manually examined and labeled each unknown word according to the neologism classification described in Section 3. In order to identify the correct class, each unknown word was considered within its context of occurrence in the corresponding blog posts and classified according to the usage within the sentence. In addition, proper names, conversational forms of existing words, and spelling errors were tagged separately. 10 2 comparison of Internet blogs and other topics for English loans 3 comparison for Medical blogs and other topics for French loans Figure 1 illustrates the correspondence of the number of borrowings per topic category in the corresponding candidate list. The results show that the most common way of forming new words within blogs dealing with Internet and computer technology is to use borrowings from English. In the medical domain, however, most neologisms are scientific terms borrowed mainly from the French language. The domain of cinema and theatre also includes a large number of loans from French. However, most of the French loans across topics seem to be older borrowings while the newer loans (i.e, within the last three to five years) are almost always from the English language. A statistical analysis of the results indicate that these correspondences are significant as shown in Figure 2 for English loans and in Figure 3 for French loans. Figure 2 illustrates a pairwise comparison between the Internet category and other blog topics based on the average percentage of documents in which a given term from the English loan neologism category is included. (*) indicates a statistically significant difference between the two percentages. Figure 3 shows a similar result for the pairwise comparison between the Medical category and other topics for the French loan class. 11 Figure 4 shows the relative usage of affixation and compounding strategies for the creation of new words. Although affixation is used to some degree in both the Internet and medical domains, they do not occur as often as the English or French loans (cf. Figure 1 above). Interestingly, the blogs that fall within the political topic category do not make much use of borrowings from English and French. Instead, they tend to create new words by applying productive affixation and compounding strategies. In most instances, the words used to form neologisms in the politics category are based on words of Arabic and Persian origin. Figure 5 illustrates the pairwise comparison between the Political and other blog topics based on the average percentage of documents in which a given term from the affixation and compounding class of neologisms is included. (*) indicates a statistically significant difference between the two percentages. Hence, while the Internet blogs make heavy use of English loans in the creation of new words, political blogs tend to use affixation and compound for word-formation. These results sug- 4 and compounding strategies for the creation of new across various blog topics 5 comparison for Political blogs and other topics for affixation and compounding 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 count Affixation Compound Internet Cinema Medical Political Sport 12 gest that, depending on the domain of interest for the particular NLP application, distinct methodologies for the automatic detection and processing of neologisms should be implemented. 5 Conclusion This paper presents an investigation of neologisms in Persian blog posts across five distinct topic areas. We employ morphological analysis in conjunction with a profile-based classification technique to successfully extract a pertinent candidate list for identifying new word-level constructions in blogs. These neologisms are then classified based on their linguistic characteristics and wordformation strategies and the quantitative analysis points to a significant correspondence between neologism classes and blog topic domains. Based on these results, we propose that the detection and processing strategies should be tailored to the domain of the NLP application for greater efficiency. In particular, a derivational morphological system can be developed by implementing the productive affixation and compounding rules used in Persian word formation. This system can be used to extend the existing analysis and translation systems in the domain of politics. Loans from English, on the other hand, can be automatically processed by using previously implemented methodologies for transcribing Persian script into the English writing system [Megerdoomian 2006, Johanson 2007]. Such a system would be beneficial in recognizing the large number of loans encountered in the technical and scientific domains. This work is part of a larger project for automatic topic classification and sentiment analysis in Persian language blogs. We extract the most pertinent neologisms encountered in the blog corpus in order to enhance the topic classification system. In addition, the results obtained will be used to extend the current morphological parser to improve coverage and identification of newly formed words. References Amtrup, Jan W. 2003.

Other unanalyzed tokens are mainly proper nouns and words missing in the lexicon. 2.3 Information Gain To automatically detect the most pertinent unknown terms per blog category, we employ an information gain (IG) based feature selection approach. IG’s effectiveness as a feature selection measure for text topic categorization, the ultimate objective of this project, has been well studied [Yang and Pedersen 1997]. Information gain is a statistical measure for calculating the expected reduction in entropy [Mitchell 1997]. Entropy, a common measure in information theory, captures the impurity of a collection of examples relative to the intended classification. For a binary classification task, the entropy of a set of examples E is defined as: where is the proportion of positive examples and is the proportion of negative examples in E. Moreover, it is assumed that is equal to zero. The discriminatory power of an attribute for a given class can then be measured by IG, which is the reduction in entropy caused by the partitioning of the data using that attribute. The IG for example set E and attribute A is define</context>

The analysis of the occurrence of neologisms across five distinct topic categories points to a correspondence between the topic domain and the type of neologism that is most commonly encountered. The results suggest that different approaches should be implemented for the automatic detection and processing of neologisms depending on the domain of application. 1 Introduction* Since its beginnings in 2001, the Persian blogosphere has undergone a dramatic growth making Persian one of the top ten languages of the global blog community in 2007 [Sifry 2007]. One of the main challenges in the automatic analysis and processing of Persian language blogs is the accelerated emergence of neologisms in online discourse. These newly created words that cannot be found in traditional lexicons primarily consist of adopted English loanwords, such as zjhlz dânlod ‘download’ or DixU ânlâyn ‘online’, and innovative constructions based on Persian word* This research is part of a larger project on the study of Persian language blogs supported by a Mission-Oriented Investigation and Experimentation (MOIE) program at MITRE. formation principles, as in D5-1.;4 fil</context>
