This paper introduces a spelling correction
system which integrates seamlessly with
morphological analysis using a multi-tape
formalism. Handling of various Semitic er-
ror problems is illustrated, with reference
to Arabic and Syriac examples. The model
handles errors vocalisation, diacritics, pho-
netic syncopation and morphographemic
idiosyncrasies, in addition to Damerau er-
rors. A complementary correction strategy
for morphologically sound but morphosyn-
tactically ill-formed words is outlined.

<bodyText confidence="0.999789842105263">
Semitic is known amongst computational linguists,
in particular computational morphologists, for its
highly inflexional morphology. Its root-and-pattern
phenomenon not only poses difficulties for a mor-
phological system, but also makes error detection
a difficult task. This paper aims at presenting a
morphographernic model which can cope with both
issues.
The following convention has been adopted. Mor-
phemes are represented in braces, { }, surface
(phonological) forms in solidi, / /, and orthographic
strings in acute brackets, ( ). In examples of gram-
mars, variables begin with a capital letter. Cs de-
note consonants, Vs denote vowels and a bar denotes
complement. An asterisk, *, indicates ill-formed
strings.
The difficulties in morphological analysis and er-
ror detection in Semitic arise from the following
facts:

root and a vowel melody, arranged accord-
ing to a canonical pattern. For example,
Arabic /kuttib/ &apos;caused to write - perfect pas-
sive&apos; is composed from the root morpheme
{ktb} &apos;notion of writing&apos; and the vowel melody
morpheme {Ili} &apos;perfect passive&apos;; the two are
arranged according to the pattern morpheme
{CVCCVC} &apos;causative&apos;. This phenomenon is
analysed by (McCarthy, 1981) along the lines
of autosegmental phonology (Goldsmith, 1976).
The analysis appears in (1).1

• Vocalisation Orthographically, Semitic texts
appear in three forms: (i) consonantal texts
do not incorporate any short vowels but ma-
tres lectionis,2 e.g. Arabic (ktb) for /lcatab/,
/kutib/ and /kutub/, but (kaatb) for /kaatab/
and /lcaatibi; (ii) partially vocalised texts
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9785598">
incorporate some short vowels to clarify am-
biguity, e.g. (kutb) for /kutib/ to distinguish
it from /katab/; and (iii) vocalised texts in-
corporate full vocalisation, e.g. (tadahraj) for
/tada.hraj/.
1We have used the CV model to describe pattern mor-
phemes instead of prosodic terms because of its familiar-
ity in the computational linguistics literature. For the
use of morale and affixational models in handling Arabic
morphology computationally, see (Kiraz, ).
21Mothers of reading&apos;, these are consonantal letters
which play the role of long vowels, and are represented
in the pattern morpheme by VV (e.g. /aa/, /uu/,
/ii/). Matres lectionis cannot be omitted from the or-
thographic string.

• Vowel and Diacritic Shifts Semitic lan-
guages employ a large number of diacritics to
represent enter alio short vowels, doubled let-
ters, and nunation.3 Most editors allow the user
to enter such diacritics above and below letters.
To speed data entry, the user usually enters the
base characters (say a paragraph) and then goes
back and enters the diacritics. A common mis-
take is to place the cursor one extra position
to the left when entering diacritics. This re-
sults in the vowels being shifted one position,
e.g. *(wkatubi) instead of (wakutib).
• Vocalisms The quality of the perfect and im-
perfect vowels of the basic forms of the Semitic
verbs are idiosyncratic. For example, the Syr-
iac root {ktb} takes the perfect vowel a, e.g.
/ktab/, while the root Inht1 takes the vowel e,
e.g. /nhet/. It is common among learners to
make mistakes such as */kteb/ or
• Phonetic Syncopation A consonantal seg-
ment may be omitted from the phonetic surface
form, but maintained in the orthographic sur-
face from. For example, Syriac (mclinta.)`city&apos; is
pronounced fmdita/.
• Idiosyncrasies The application of a mor-
phographemic rule may have constraints as on
which lexical morphemes it may or may not ap-
ply. For example, the glottal stop [P] at the end
of a stem may become [w] when followed by the
relative adjective morpheme {iyy}, as in Arabic
/samaa2-4-iyy/ -+ /samaawiyy/ &apos;heavenly&apos;, but
/hawaaP-Fiyy/ /hawaaPiyy/ &apos;of air&apos;.
• Morphosyntactic Issues In broken plurals,
diminutives and deverbal nouns, the user may
enter a morphologically sound, but morphosyn-
tactically ill-formed word. We shall discuss this
in more detail in section 4.4

To the above, one adds language-independent issues
in spell checking such as the four Damerau trans-
formations: omission, insertion, transposition and
substitution (Damerau, 1964).

2.1 The Formalism
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9971456">
In order to handle the non-linear phenomenon of
Arabic, our model adopts the two-level formalism
presented by (Pulman and Hepple, 1993), with the
multi tape extensions in (Kiraz, 1994). Their for-
malism appears in (2).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9398213">
TWO-LEVEL FORMALISM
LLC - LEX - RLC
LSC - SURF - RSC
where
LLC = left lexical context
LEX = lexical form
RLC • right lexical context
LSC = left surface context
SURF • surface form
RSC • right surface context
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.947519823529412">
The special symbol * is a wildcard matching any con-
text, with no length restrictions. The operator 4*
caters for obligatory rules. A lexical string maps to
a surface string if they can be partitioned into pairs
of lexical-surface subsequences, where each pair is
licenced by a = or &lt;4. rule, and no partition violates
a &lt;#. rule. In the multi-tape version, lexical expres-
sions (i.e. LLC, LEX and RLC) are n-tuple of regu-
lar expressions of the form (xi, x2, x„): the ith
expression refers to symbols on the ith tape; a null
slot is indicated by e.3 Another extension is giving
LLC the ability to contain ellipsis, ... , which in-
dicates the (optional) omission from LLC of tuples,
provided that the tuples to the left of... are the first
to appear on the left of LEX.
In our morphographemic model, we add a similar
formalism for expressing error rules (3).

&apos;Our implementation interprets rules directly; hence,
we allow e. If the rules were to be compiled into au-

2.2 The Model
2.2.1 Finding the error
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995055555555">
Morphological analysis is first called with the as-
sumption that the word is free of errors. If this fails,
analysis is attempted again without the &apos;no error&apos; re-
striction. The error rules are then considered when
ordinary morphological rules fail. If no error rules
succeed, or lead to a successful partition of the word,
analysis backtracks to try the error rules at succes-
sively earlier points in the word.
For purposes of simplicity and because on the
whole is it likely that words will contain no more
than one error (Damerau, 1964; Pollock and Zamora,
1983), normal &apos;no error&apos; analysis usually resumes if
an error rule succeeds. The exception occurs with a
vowel shift error (§3.2.1). If this error rule succeeds,
an expectation of further shifted vowels is set up,
but no other error rule is allowed in the subsequent
partitions. For this reason rules are marked as to
whether they can occur more than once.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.972563">
2.2.2 Suggesting a correction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954071428572">
Once an error rule is selected, the corrected sur-
face is substituted for the error surface, and nor-
mal analysis continues - at the same position. The
substituted surface may be in the form of a vari-
able, which is then ground by the normal analysis
sequence of lexical matching over the lexicon tree.
In this way only lexical words are considered, as
the variable letter can only be instantiated to letters
branching out from the current position on the lexi-
con tree. Normal prolog backtracking to explore al-
ternative rules/lexical branches applies throughout.
Subsection 3.1 presents a simple two-level gram-
mar which describes the above data. Subsection 3.2

<bodyText confidence="0.946820583333333">
The lexical level maintains three lexical tapes (Kay,
1987; Kiraz, 1994): pattern tape, root tape and vo-
calism tape; each tape scans a lexical tree. Exam-
ples of pattern morphemes are: {civic2vi c3} (M 1),
{cic2vinc3v2c4} (M Q3). The root morphemes are
{ktb} and {dhrj}, and the vocalism morphemes are
{a} (active) and luil (passive).
The following two-level grammar handles the
above data. Each lexical expression is a triple; lex-
ical expressions with one symbol assume e on the
remaining positions.

<bodyText confidence="0.998183222222222">
We demonstrate our model on the Arabic verbal
stems shown in (4) (McCarthy, 1981). Verbs are
classified according to their measure (M): there
are 15 trilateral measures and 4 quadrilateral ones.
Moving horizontally across the table, one notices a
change in vowel melody (active {a}, passive luil);
everything else remains invariant. Moving vertically,
a change in canonical pattern occurs; everything else
remains invariant.

(5) gives three general rules: RU allows any char-
acter on the first lexical tape to surface, e.g. in-
fixes, prefixes and suffixes. R1 states that any P E
{C1, C2, C3, c4} on the first (pattern) tape and C
on the second (root) tape with no transition on the
third (vocalism) tape corresponds to C on the sur-
face tape; this rule sanctions consonants. Similarly,
R2 states that any P E {vi, v2} on the pattern tape
and V on vocalism tape with no transition on the
root tape corresponds to V on the surface tape; this
rule sanctions vowels.
Resuming the description of the grammar, (8)
presents spreading rules. Notice the use of ellipsis
to indicate that there can be tuples separating LEX
and LLC, as far as the tuples in LLC are the nearest
ones to LEX. R5 sanctions the spreading (and gem-
ination) of consonants. R6 sanctions the spreading
of the first vowel. Spreading examples appear in (9).

Before embarking on the rest of the rules, an il-

A vowel shift error rule will be tried with a parti-
tion on a (short) vowel which is not an expected (lex-
ical) vowel at that position. Short vowels can legiti-
mately be omitted from an orthographic representa-
tion - it is this fact which contributes to the problem
of vowel shifts. A vowel is considered shifted if the
same vowel has been omitted earlier in the word.
The rule deletes the vowel from the surface. Hence
in the next pass of (normal) analysis, the partition
is analysed as a legitimate omission of the expected
vowel. This prepares for the next shifted vowel to
be treated in exactly the same way as the first. The
expectation of this reapplication is allowed for in
reap = y.

In the rules above, &apos;X&apos; is the shifted vowel. It is
deleted from the surface. The partition contextual
tuples consist of [RULE NAME, SURF, LEX]. The
LEX element is a tuple itself of [PATTERN, ROOT,
VOCALISM]. In E0 the shifted vowel was analysed
earlier as an omitted stem vowel (om_stmv), whereas
in El it was analysed earlier as an omitted spread
vowel (om_sprv). The surface/lexical restrictions in
the contexts could be written out in more detail, but
both rules make use of the fact that those contexts
are analysed by other partitions, which check that
they meet the conditions for an omitted stem vowel
or omitted spread vowel.

This section deals with morphosyntactic errors

Daniel Ponsford (personal communication), based
on (Wehr, 1971).
Recall that a Semitic stems consists of a root mor-
pheme and a vocalism morpheme arranged accord-
ing to a canonical pattern morpheme. As each root
does not occur in all vocalisms and patterns, each
lexical entry is associated with a feature structure
which indicates inter alia the possible patterns and
vocalisms for a particular root. Consider the nomi-

Usually this feature-clash situation creates the
problem of which constituent to give preference to
(Langer, 1990). Here the vocalism indicates the in-
flection (e.g. broken plural) and the preferance of
vocalism pattern for that type of inflection belongs
to the root. For example *(kid)would be anal-
ysed as root {Mg} with a broken plural vocalism.
The pattern type of the vocalism clashes with the
broken plural pattern that the root expects. To cor-
rect, the morphological analyser is executed in gen-
eration mode to generate the broken plural form of
fkdgl in the normal way.
The same procedure can be applied on diminutive
and deverbal nouns.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972125">
The model presented corrects errors resulting from
combining nonconcatenative strings as well as more
standard morphological or spelling errors. It cov-
ers Semitic errors relating to vocalisation, diacrit-
ics, phonetic syncopation and morphographemic id-
iosyncrasies. Morphosyntactic issues of broken plu-
rals, diminutives and deverbal nouns can be handled
by a complementary correction strategy which also
depends on morphological analysis.
Other than the economic factor, an important ad-
vantage of combining morphological analysis and er-
ror detection/correction is the way the lexical tree
associated with the analysis can be used to deter-
mine correction possibilities. The morphological
analysis proceeds by selecting rules that hypothesise
lexical strings for a given surface string. The rules
are accepted/rejected by checking that the lexical
string(s) can extend along the lexical tree(s) from
the current position(s). Variables introduced by er-
ror rules into the surface string are then instantiated
by associating surface with lexical, and matching
lexical strings to the lexicon tree(s). The system is
unable to consider correction characters that would
be lexical impossibilities.

<abstract confidence="0.993556230769231">This paper introduces a spelling correction system which integrates seamlessly with morphological analysis using a multi-tape formalism. Handling of various Semitic error problems is illustrated, with reference to Arabic and Syriac examples. The model handles errors vocalisation, diacritics, phonetic syncopation and morphographemic idiosyncrasies, in addition to Damerau errors. A complementary correction strategy for morphologically sound but morphosyntactically ill-formed words is outlined.</abstract>

If this fails, analysis is attempted again without the &apos;no error&apos; restriction. The error rules are then considered when ordinary morphological rules fail. If no error rules succeed, or lead to a successful partition of the word, analysis backtracks to try the error rules at successively earlier points in the word. For purposes of simplicity and because on the whole is it likely that words will contain no more than one error (Damerau, 1964; Pollock and Zamora, 1983), normal &apos;no error&apos; analysis usually resumes if an error rule succeeds. The exception occurs with a vowel shift error (§3.2.1). If this error rule succeeds, an expectation of further shifted vowels is set up, but no other error rule is allowed in the subsequent partitions. For this reason rules are marked as to whether they can occur more than once. 2.2.2 Suggesting a correction Once an error rule is selected, the corrected surface is substituted for the error surface, and normal analysis continues - at the same position.

Subsection 2.1 presents the formalism used, and subsection 2.2 describes the model. 2.1 The Formalism In order to handle the non-linear phenomenon of Arabic, our model adopts the two-level formalism presented by (Pulman and Hepple, 1993), with the multi tape extensions in (Kiraz, 1994). Their formalism appears in (2). TWO-LEVEL FORMALISM LLC - LEX - RLC LSC - SURF - RSC where LLC = left lexical context LEX = lexical form RLC • right lexical context LSC = left surface context SURF • surface form RSC • right surface context The special symbol * is a wildcard matching any context, with no length restrictions. The operator 4* caters for obligatory rules. A lexical string maps to a surface string if they can be partitioned into pairs of lexical-surface subsequences, where each pair is licenced by a = or &lt;4. rule, and no partition </context>

A common mistake is to write it as *(samma?iyy). E4: ? w where reap = n { * - [glottal_change, w,(Pc,?,e)] } The `glottal_change&apos; rule would be a normal morphological spelling change rule, incorporating contextual constraints (e.g. for the morpheme boundary) as necessary. 4 Broken Plurals, Diminutive and Deverbal Nouns This section deals with morphosyntactic errors which are independent of the two-level analysis. The data described below was obtained from Daniel Ponsford (personal communication), based on (Wehr, 1971). Recall that a Semitic stems consists of a root morpheme and a vocalism morpheme arranged according to a canonical pattern morpheme. As each root does not occur in all vocalisms and patterns, each lexical entry is associated with a feature structure which indicates inter alia the possible patterns and vocalisms for a particular root. Consider the nominal data in (17).
