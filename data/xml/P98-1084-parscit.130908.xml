Our experience with a critiquing system shows
that when the system detects problems with the
user&apos;s performance, multiple critiques are often
produced. Analysis of a corpus of actual cri-
tiques revealed that even though each individ-
ual critique is concise and coherent, the set of
critiques as a whole may exhibit several prob-
lems that detract from conciseness and coher-
ence, and consequently assimilation. Thus a
text planner was needed that could integrate the
text plans for individual communicative goals to
produce an overall text plan representing a con-
cise, coherent message.
This paper presents our general rule-based
system for accomplishing this task. The sys-
tem takes as input a set of individual text plans
represented as RST-style trees, and produces
a smaller set of more complex trees represent-
ing integrated messages that still achieve the
multiple communicative goals of the individual
text plans. Domain-independent rules are used
to capture strategies across domains, while the
facility for addition of domain-dependent rules
enables the system to be tuned to the require-
ments of a particular domain. The system has
been tested on a corpus of critiques in the do-
main of trauma care.

Many natural language systems have been de-
veloped to generate coherent text plans (Moore
and Paris, 1993; Hovy, 1991; Wanner and Hovy,
1996; Zukerman and McConachy, 1995). How-
ever, none has the ability to take a set of inde-
pendently generated yet inter-related text plans
and produce integrated plans that realize all of
the communicative goals in a concise and coher-
ent manner.
RTPI (Rule-based Text Plan Integrator) was
designed to perform this task. The need for
coherence requires that the system be able to

identify and resolve conflict across multiple, in-
dependent text plans, and exploit relations be-
tween communicative goals. Conciseness re-
quires the ability to aggregate and subsume
communicative goals. Although our work was
motivated by the need to produce coherent, in-
tegrated messages from the individual critiques
produced by a decision support system for emer-
gency center trauma care, this same task will
arise in future systems as they make use of in-
dependent modules that need to communicate
with a user. Thus the system should have sim-
ple, domain-independent rules, but should also
be flexible enough to allow the addition of rules
specific to the domain at hand.
This paper describes RTPI and our initial
implementation that works with the kinds of
text plans representative of a critiquing system.
While our examples are taken from the domain
of trauma care, the domain-independent rules
make the system applicable to other domains of
critiquing and instruction as well. The moti-
vation behind RTPI is presented in Section 2,
and Section 3 contrasts it with other work.
Then we describe the system&apos;s parameters that
allow flexible response in multiple environments
(Section 4). The heart of the system is RTPI&apos;s
domain-independent rule base (Section 5) for
integrating text plans. The implemented algo-
rithm and the results of its application are pre-
sented last.

2 Motivation

<bodyText confidence="0.9997245">
TraumAID (Webber et al., 1992) is a decision
support system for addressing the initial defini-
tive management of multiple trauma. Trauma-
TIQ (Gertner and Webber, 1996) is a module
that infers a physician&apos;s plan for managing pa-
tient care, compares it to TraumAID&apos;s plan, and
critiques significant differences between them.
TraumaTIQ recognizes four classes of differ-
ences: errors of omission, errors of commission,
scheduling errors, and procedure choice errors.
Experimentation with TraumaTIQ showed that
when the physician&apos;s plan is deficient, several
problems are generally detected, and thus mul-
tiple critiques are independently produced.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9999795">
We analyzed 5361 individual critiques com-
prising 753 critique sets produced by Trauma-
TIQ on actual cases of trauma care. A critique
set represents the critiques that are produced at
a particular point in a case. While each critique
was coherent and concise in isolation, we found
several problems within critique sets: some cri-
tiques detracted from others in the critique set;
some would make more sense if they took ex-
plicit account of other critiques appearing ear-
lier in the set; and there was informational over-
lap among critiques.
Our analysis revealed 22 common patterns
of inter-related critiques, each pattern covering
some subset of a critique set. While we initially
developed a domain-dependent system, Trau-
maGEN, that operated directly on the logical
form of the critiques produced by TraumaTIQ,
we noted that many of the patterns were more
generally applicable, and that the problems we
were addressing would also arise in other sophis-
ticated systems that distribute their processing
across multiple independent modules, each of
which may need to communicate with the user.
While such systems could be designed to try
to prevent problems of this kind from arising,
the result would be less modular, more complex,
and more difficult to extend.
Thus we developed RTPI, a system for con-
structing a set of integrated RST-style text
plans from a set of individual text plans. RTPI
contains a set of domain-independent rules,
along with adjustable parameters• that deter-
mine when and how rules are invoked. In ad-
dition, RTPI allows the addition of domain-
dependent rules, so the system can account for
interactions and strategies particular to a do-
main.

The idea of domain-independent text planning
rules is not new. Appelt (1985) used &amp;quot;inter-
actions typical of linguistic actions&amp;quot; to design
critics for action subsumption in KAMP. REVI-
SOR (Callaway and Lester, 1997) used domain-
independent operators for revision of a text plan
for explanation. Because our rules operate on
full RST-style text plans that include commu-
nicative goals, the rules can be designed to in-
tegrate the text plans in ways that still satisfy
those goals.
The Sentence Planner (Wanner and Hovy,
1996) uses rules to refine a single initial tree rep-
resentation. In contrast, RTPI operates on sets
of complete, independent text plan trees. And
while REVISOR handles clause aggregation,
and Sentence Planner removes redundancies by
aggregating neighboring expressions, neither of
them addresses the aggregation of communica-
tive goals (often requiring reorganization), the

communicative goals as done by RTPI. Simi-
larly, WISHFUL (Zukerman and McConachy,
1995) includes an optimization phase during
which it chooses the optimal way to achieve a
set of related communicative goals. However,
the system can choose to eliminate propositions
and does not have to deal with potential conflict
within the information to be conveyed.

4 System Parameters
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929333333334">
Although RTPI&apos;s rules are intended to be
domain-independent, environmental factors
such as the purpose of the messages and the
social role of the system affect how individual
text plans should be integrated. For example,
if the system&apos;s purpose is to provide directions
for performing a task, then an ordered set of
actions will be acceptable; in contrast, if the
system&apos;s purpose is decision support, with the
user retaining responsibility for the selected
actions, then a better organization will be one
in which actions are grouped in terms of the
objectives they achieve (see Section 5.1.1).
Similarly, in some environments it might be
reasonable to resolve conflict by omitting
communicative goals that conflict with the sys-
tem&apos;s action recommendations, while in other
environments such omission is undesirable (see
Section 5.1.2).
RTPI has a set of system parameters that
capture these environmental factors. These pa-
rameters affect what rules are applied, and in
some cases how they are applied. They allow
characteristics of the output text plans to be
tailored to broad classes of domains, giving the
system the flexibility to be effective over a wide
range of problems.

5 The Rule-Base
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999706">
RTPI&apos;s input consists of a set of text plans,
each of which has a top-level communicative
goal. Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and
Thompson, 1987) posits that a coherent text
plan consists of segments related to one an-
other by rhetorical relations such as MOTIVA-
TION Or BACKGROUND. Each text plan pre-
sented to RTPI is a tree structure in which
individual nodes are related by RST-style re-
lations. The top-level communicative goal for
each text plan is expressed as an intended effect
on the user&apos;s mental state (Moore, 1995), such
as (GOAL USER (DO ACTION27)). The kinds of goals
that RTPI handles are typical of critiquing sys-
tems, systems that provide instructions for per-
forming a task, etc. These goals may consist of
getting the user to perform actions, refrain from
performing actions, use an alternate method to
achieve a goal, or recognize the temporal con-
straints on actions.
Rules are defined in terms of tree specifica-
tions and operators, and are stylistically simi-
lar to the kinds of rules proposed in (Wanner
and Hovy, 1996). When all the tree specifica-
tions are matched, the score function of the rule
is evaluated. The score function is a heuristic
specific to each rule, and is used to determine
which rule instantiation has the best potential
text realization. Scores for aggregation rules,
for example, measure the opportunity to re-
duce repetition through aggregation, subsump-
tion, or pronominal reference, and penalize for
paragraph complexity.
Once a rule instantiation is chosen, the sys-
tem performs any substitutions, pruning, and
moving of branches specified by the rule&apos;s op-
erators. The rules currently in use operate on
text plan trees in a pairwise fashion, and re-
cursively add more text plans to larger, already
integrated plans.

5.1 Classes of Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997763">
RTPI has three classes of rules, all of which
produce an integrated text plan from separate
text plans. The classes of rules correlate with
the three categories of problems that we identi-
fied from our analysis of TraumaTIQ&apos;s critiques,
namely, the need to: 1) aggregate communica-
tive goals to achieve more succinct text plans;
2) resolve conflict among text plans; and 3) ex-
ploit the relationships between communicative
goals to enhance coherence.

appear repetitious. Aggregation of the commu-
nicative goals associated with these actions and
objectives allows RTPI to make the message
more concise.
Aggregation of overlapping communicative
goals is not usually straightforward, however,
and often requires substantial reorganizing of
the trees. Our approach was to draw on the or-
dered, multi-nuclear SEQUENCE relation of RST.
We posited that separate plans with overlapping
communicative goals could often be reorganized
as a sequence of communicative goals in a sin-
gle plan. The recommended actions can be dis-
tributed over the sequentially related goals as
long as the new plan captures the relationships
between the actions and their motivations given
in the original plans.
For example, one complex class of aggrega-
tion is the integration of text plans that have
overlapping actions or objectives, but also con-
tain actions and objectives that do not overlap.
When those that overlap can be placed together
as part of a valid sequence, a multi-part message
can be generated. RTPI produces an integrated
text plan comprised of sequentially related seg-
ments, with the middle segment conveying the
shared actions and their collected motivations.
The other segments convey the actions that
temporally precede or follow the shared actions,
and are also presented with their motivations.
For example (Fig. 5), suppose that one text
plan has the goal of getting the user to perform
actions AO, A2, and A3 to achieve Gl, while a
second text plan has a goal of getting the user
to perform Al, A2, A3, and A4 to achieve G2.
Figure 3 presents the text plan resulting from
the application of this rule. Realization of this
text plan in English produces the message:
Do AO as part of Gl, and Al as part of G2.
Next do A2 and A3 to address both of these
goals. Then do A4 to complete G2.

This kind of aggregation is especially appropri-
ate in a domain (such as trauma care) where
the clause re-ordering normally applied to en-
able aggregation (e.g. Sentence Planner) is re-
stricted by the partial ordering of sequenced in-
structions.
RTPI can also handle aggregation when ac-
tions or objectives are shared between differ-
ent kinds of communicative goals. The bot-
tom part of Figure 1 is the text realized from
a text plan that was produced by the appli-
cation of two rules to three initial text plans:
one rule that applies to trees of the same form,
and one that applies to two distinct forms. The
first rule aggregates the communicative goal
(GOAL USER (DO USER check_med_allergies)) that exists
in two of the text plans. The second rule looks
for overlap between the communicative goal of
getting the user to do an action and the goal of
having the user recognize a temporal constraint
on actions. The application of these two rules
to the text plans of the three initial messages
shown in the top part of Figure 1 creates the
integrated text plan shown in Figure 4 whose
English realization appears in the bottom part
of Figure 1.
RTPI&apos;s parameter settings capture aspects of
the environment in which the messages will be
generated that will affect the kind of aggrega-
tion that is most appropriate. The settings for
aggregation determine whether RTPI empha-
sizes actions or objectives. In the latter case
(appropriate in the trauma decision-support en-
vironment), an arbitrary limit of three is placed
on the number of sequentially related segments
in a multi-part message, though each segment
can still address multiple goals. This allows the
reorganization of communicative goals to enable
aggregation while maintaining focus on objec-
tives.

5.1.2 Resolving Conflict
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.953919127659574">
The ability to recognize and resolve conflict is
required in a text planner because both the ap-
pearance and resolution of conflict can be the
result of text structure. RTPI identifies and re-
solves a class of domain-independent conflict,
with the resolution strategies dependent upon
the social relationship between the user and the
system. In addition, the system allows the user
to add rules for domain-specific classes of con-
flict.
One class of conflict that can best be resolved
at the text planning level results from implicit
messages in text. Resolving conflict of this kind
within independent modules of a critiquing sys-
tem would require sharing extensive knowledge,
thereby violating modularity concepts and mak-
ing the planning process much more complex.
For example, suppose that the user has con-
veyed an intention to achieve a particular objec-
tive by performing act A. One system module
might post the communicative goal of getting
the user to recognize that act Ap must precede
Au, while a different module posts the goal of
getting the user to achieve the objective by ex-
ecuting A, instead of A. While each of these
communicative goals might be well-motivated
and coherent in isolation, together they are in-
coherent, since the first presumes that At, will
be executed, while the second recommends re-
tracting the intention to perform A. A text
planner with access to both of these top-level
communicative goals and their text plans can
recognize this implicit conflict and revise and
integrate the text plans to resolve it.
There are many ways to unambiguously re-
solve this class of implicit conflict. Strategy se-
lection depends on the social relationship be-
tween the system and the user, as captured by
three of RTPI&apos;s parameter settings. This re-
lationship is defined by the relative levels of
knowledge, expertise, and responsibility of the
system and user. Three strategies used by our
system, and their motivations, are:
I. Discard communicative goals that implicitly
conflict with a system recommendation. In
the above example, this would result in a
text plan that only recommends doing A,

While the two critiques do not conflict, RTPI&apos;s
rules exploit the relation between the commu-

produce a more concise and coherent message.
In particular, one of RTPI&apos;s rules recognizes the
interaction between an initial plan to get the
user to perform an action A,, and a second plan
that gets the user to recognize a dependency be-
tween A, and another action. This rule creates
a text plan for the message:

ruling out abdominal bleeding. Use the results
of the peritoneal lavage to decide whether to
reassess the patient in 6 to 24 hours.

5.2 Trailing Comments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998706825">
Occasionally when several text plans are inte-
grated into a single text plan, another text plan
that overlaps with the integrated plan will re-
main outside the new plan because the scoring
function for the applicable rule was too low to
allow it to combine. This is typically because an
effort to integrate such a text plan would create
a message so complex that the heuristic deemed
it inappropriate.
However, once concepts have been introduced
in the integrated text plan, focusing heuristics
(McKeown, 1985) suggest that other text plans
containing these concepts be included in the in-
tegrated plan as well. Rather than restructure
the result of our transformation (against the ad-
vice of our heuristic), we append them to the
end of the message. Thus we refer to them as
trailing comments.
Unfortunately, when the communicative goal
is to get the user to perform an action, trailing
comments that refer to such actions have the po-
tential to erroneously suggest new instances of
actions. Our solution to this problem is imple-
mented in the text realization templates, where
we (1) make the focused action the subject of
the sentence, reflecting its given status in the
discourse, (2) utilize clue words to call atten-

RTPI performs rule-based integration of a set
of RST-style trees. Rules are applied in an or-
der designed to maximize derived benefit. The
system first applies the rules that resolve con-
flict, since we hypothesize that the presence of
conflict will most seriously hamper assimilation
of a message. Next, the rules that exploit rela-
tions between text plans are tried because they
enhance coherence by explicitly connecting dif-
ferent communicative goals. Then the aggrega-
tion rules are applied to improve conciseness.
Finally, the rules for trailing comments reduce
the number of disconnected message units.
The algorithm is both greedy and anytime
(Garvey and Lesser, 1994); it takes the best re-
sult from a single application of a rule to a set of
text plans, and then attempts to further apply
rules to the modified set. The rule instantiation
with the highest heuristic score is chosen and
the rule&apos;s operator is applied to the trees using
those bindings. Since the rules are designed to
apply incrementally to a set, every application
of a rule results in an improvement in the con-
ciseness or coherence of the tree set, and the
tree set is always a viable set of text plans. The
user can thus set a time limit for processing of
a tree set, and the algorithm can return an im-
proved set at any time. In practice, however,
the processing has never taken more than 1-2
seconds, even for large (25 plans) input sets.

We tested RTPI using the corpus of critiques
generated by TraumaTIQ. A set of critiques was
extracted from the middle of each of 48 trauma
cases, and RST-style text plans were automati-
cally generated for all the critiques. Then RTPI
ran each set, and messages resulting from a
template-based realization of RTP1&apos;s text plans
were analyzed for conciseness and coherence.
We are currently using templates for sentence
realization since we have been working in the
domain of trauma care, where fast real-time re-
sponse is essential.
There was a 18% reduction in the aver-
age number of individual text plans in the 48
sets examined. The results for individual sets
ranged from no integration in cases where all of
the text plans were independent of one another,
to a 60% reduction in sets that were heavily
inter-related. More concise messages also re-
sulted from a 12% reduction in the number of
references to the diagnostic and therapeutic ac-
tions and objectives that are the subject of this
domain. The new text plans also allowed some
references to be replaced by pronouns during
realization, making the messages shorter and
more natural.
To evaluate coherence, messages from twelve
cases1 were presented, in randomly ordered
blind pairs, to three human subjects not affili-
ated with our project. The written instructions
given to the subjects instructed them to note
whether one set of messages was more compre-
hensible, and if so, to note why. Two subjects
preferred the new messages in 11 of 12 cases,
and one subject preferred them in all cases. All
subjects strongly preferred the messages pro-
duced from the integrated text plan 69% of the

<abstract confidence="0.998230571969697">Our experience with a critiquing system shows that when the system detects problems with the user&apos;s performance, multiple critiques are often produced. Analysis of a corpus of actual critiques revealed that even though each individual critique is concise and coherent, the set of critiques as a whole may exhibit several problems that detract from conciseness and coherence, and consequently assimilation. Thus a text planner was needed that could integrate the text plans for individual communicative goals to produce an overall text plan representing a concise, coherent message. This paper presents our general rule-based system for accomplishing this task. The systakes as input a individual text plans represented as RST-style trees, and produces a smaller set of more complex trees representing integrated messages that still achieve the multiple communicative goals of the individual text plans. Domain-independent rules are used to capture strategies across domains, while the facility for addition of domain-dependent rules enables the system to be tuned to the requirements of a particular domain. The system has been tested on a corpus of critiques in the domain of trauma care. 1 Overview Many natural language systems have been developed to generate coherent text plans (Moore and Paris, 1993; Hovy, 1991; Wanner and Hovy, 1996; Zukerman and McConachy, 1995). However, none has the ability to take a set of independently generated yet inter-related text plans and produce integrated plans that realize all of the communicative goals in a concise and coherent manner. Text Plan Integrator) was designed to perform this task. The need for coherence requires that the system be able to * This work was supported by the National Library of Medicine under grant ROI-LM-05764-01. We thank Bonnie Webber and John Clarke for their suggestions and advice during the course of this research. identify and resolve conflict across multiple, independent text plans, and exploit relations between communicative goals. Conciseness requires the ability to aggregate and subsume communicative goals. Although our work was motivated by the need to produce coherent, integrated messages from the individual critiques produced by a decision support system for emergency center trauma care, this same task will arise in future systems as they make use of independent modules that need to communicate with a user. Thus the system should have simple, domain-independent rules, but should also be flexible enough to allow the addition of rules specific to the domain at hand. paper describes our initial implementation that works with the kinds of text plans representative of a critiquing system. While our examples are taken from the domain of trauma care, the domain-independent rules make the system applicable to other domains of critiquing and instruction as well. The motibehind presented in Section 2, and Section 3 contrasts it with other work. Then we describe the system&apos;s parameters that allow flexible response in multiple environments 4). The heart of the system is domain-independent rule base (Section 5) for integrating text plans. The implemented algorithm and the results of its application are presented last. 2 Motivation TraumAID (Webber et al., 1992) is a decision support system for addressing the initial definitive management of multiple trauma. Trauma- TIQ (Gertner and Webber, 1996) is a module that infers a physician&apos;s plan for managing patient care, compares it to TraumAID&apos;s plan, and critiques significant differences between them. TraumaTIQ recognizes four classes of differences: errors of omission, errors of commission, scheduling errors, and procedure choice errors. Experimentation with TraumaTIQ showed that when the physician&apos;s plan is deficient, several problems are generally detected, and thus multiple critiques are independently produced. 512 We analyzed 5361 individual critiques comprising 753 critique sets produced by Trauma- TIQ on actual cases of trauma care. A critique set represents the critiques that are produced at a particular point in a case. While each critique was coherent and concise in isolation, we found several problems within critique sets: some critiques detracted from others in the critique set; some would make more sense if they took explicit account of other critiques appearing earlier in the set; and there was informational overlap among critiques. Our analysis revealed 22 common patterns of inter-related critiques, each pattern covering some subset of a critique set. While we initially developed a domain-dependent system, TraumaGEN, that operated directly on the logical form of the critiques produced by TraumaTIQ, we noted that many of the patterns were more generally applicable, and that the problems we were addressing would also arise in other sophisticated systems that distribute their processing across multiple independent modules, each of which may need to communicate with the user. While such systems could be designed to try to prevent problems of this kind from arising, the result would be less modular, more complex, and more difficult to extend. we developed system for constructing a set of integrated RST-style text from a set of individual text plans. contains a set of domain-independent rules, along with adjustable parameters• that determine when and how rules are invoked. In adthe addition of domaindependent rules, so the system can account for interactions and strategies particular to a domain. 3 Other Work The idea of domain-independent text planning rules is not new. Appelt (1985) used &amp;quot;interactions typical of linguistic actions&amp;quot; to design critics for action subsumption in KAMP. REVI- SOR (Callaway and Lester, 1997) used domainindependent operators for revision of a text plan for explanation. Because our rules operate on full RST-style text plans that include communicative goals, the rules can be designed to integrate the text plans in ways that still satisfy those goals. The Sentence Planner (Wanner and Hovy, 1996) uses rules to refine a single initial tree rep- In contrast, on of complete, independent text plan trees. And while REVISOR handles clause aggregation, and Sentence Planner removes redundancies by aggregating neighboring expressions, neither of them addresses the aggregation of communicative goals (often requiring reorganization), the TraumaTIQ critiques: Caution: check for medication allergies and do a laparotomy immediately to treat the intra-abdominal injury. Consider checking for medication allergies now to treat a possible GI tract injury. Please remember to check for medication allergies before you give antibiotics. from plan: Caution: check for medication allergies to treat the intra-abdominal injury and a possible GI tract injury, and do it before giving antibiotics. Then do a laparotomy to complete treating the intra-abdominal injury. Figure 1: Result of communicative goal aggregation. revision and integration of text plans to remove conflict, or the exploiting of relations between goals as done by Similarly, WISHFUL (Zukerman and McConachy, 1995) includes an optimization phase during which it chooses the optimal way to achieve a set of related communicative goals. However, the system can choose to eliminate propositions and does not have to deal with potential conflict within the information to be conveyed. 4 System Parameters are intended to be domain-independent, environmental factors such as the purpose of the messages and the social role of the system affect how individual text plans should be integrated. For example, if the system&apos;s purpose is to provide directions for performing a task, then an ordered set of actions will be acceptable; in contrast, if the system&apos;s purpose is decision support, with the user retaining responsibility for the selected actions, then a better organization will be one in which actions are grouped in terms of the objectives they achieve (see Section 5.1.1). Similarly, in some environments it might be reasonable to resolve conflict by omitting communicative goals that conflict with the system&apos;s action recommendations, while in other environments such omission is undesirable (see Section 5.1.2). a set of system parameters that capture these environmental factors. These parameters affect what rules are applied, and in some cases how they are applied. They allow characteristics of the output text plans to be tailored to broad classes of domains, giving the system the flexibility to be effective over a wide range of problems. 513 5 The Rule-Base of a set of text plans, each of which has a top-level communicative goal. Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1987) posits that a coherent text plan consists of segments related to one anby rhetorical relations such as MOTIVAtext plan preto a tree structure in which individual nodes are related by RST-style relations. The top-level communicative goal for each text plan is expressed as an intended effect on the user&apos;s mental state (Moore, 1995), such USER (DO ACTION27)). kinds of goals are typical of critiquing systems, systems that provide instructions for performing a task, etc. These goals may consist of getting the user to perform actions, refrain from performing actions, use an alternate method to achieve a goal, or recognize the temporal constraints on actions. Rules are defined in terms of tree specifications and operators, and are stylistically similar to the kinds of rules proposed in (Wanner and Hovy, 1996). When all the tree specifications are matched, the score function of the rule is evaluated. The score function is a heuristic specific to each rule, and is used to determine which rule instantiation has the best potential text realization. Scores for aggregation rules, for example, measure the opportunity to reduce repetition through aggregation, subsumption, or pronominal reference, and penalize for paragraph complexity. Once a rule instantiation is chosen, the system performs any substitutions, pruning, and moving of branches specified by the rule&apos;s operators. The rules currently in use operate on text plan trees in a pairwise fashion, and recursively add more text plans to larger, already integrated plans. 5.1 Classes of Rules three classes of rules, all of which produce an integrated text plan from separate text plans. The classes of rules correlate with the three categories of problems that we identified from our analysis of TraumaTIQ&apos;s critiques, namely, the need to: 1) aggregate communicative goals to achieve more succinct text plans; 2) resolve conflict among text plans; and 3) exploit the relationships between communicative goals to enhance coherence. 5.1.1 Aggregation of TraumaTIQ&apos;s output showed that one prevalent problem was informational overlap, i.e. the same actions and objectives often appeared as part of several different inplans, and thus the resulting messages</abstract>

Aggregation of overlapping communicative goals is not usually straightforward, however, and often requires substantial reorganizing of the trees. Our approach was to draw on the ormulti-nuclear of RST. We posited that separate plans with overlapping communicative goals could often be reorganized as a sequence of communicative goals in a single plan. The recommended actions can be distributed over the sequentially related goals as long as the new plan captures the relationships between the actions and their motivations given in the original plans. For example, one complex class of aggregation is the integration of text plans that have overlapping actions or objectives, but also contain actions and objectives that do not overlap. When those that overlap can be placed together as part of a valid sequence, a multi-part message be generated. an integrated text plan comprised of sequentially related segments, with the middle segment conveying the shared actions and their collected motivations. The other segments convey the actions that temporally precede or follow the shared actions, and are also presented with their motivations. For example (Fig. 5), suppose that one text plan has the goal of getting the user to perform actions AO, A2, and A3 to achieve Gl, while a second text plan has a goal of getting the user to perform Al, A2, A3, and A4 to achieve G2. Figure 3 presents the text plan resulting from the application of this rule. Realization of this text plan in English produces the message: part of Gl, and Al as part of G2. do address both of these goals. Then do A4 to complete G2.</abstract>

The bottom part of Figure 1 is the text realized from a text plan that was produced by the application of two rules to three initial text plans: one rule that applies to trees of the same form, and one that applies to two distinct forms. The first rule aggregates the communicative goal USER (DO USER check_med_allergies)) exists in two of the text plans. The second rule looks for overlap between the communicative goal of getting the user to do an action and the goal of having the user recognize a temporal constraint on actions. The application of these two rules to the text plans of the three initial messages shown in the top part of Figure 1 creates the integrated text plan shown in Figure 4 whose English realization appears in the bottom part of Figure 1. settings capture aspects of the environment in which the messages will be generated that will affect the kind of aggregation that is most appropriate. The settings for determine whether emphasizes actions or objectives. In the latter case (appropriate in the trauma decision-support environment), an arbitrary limit of three is placed on the number of sequentially related segments in a multi-part message, though each segment can still address multiple goals. This allows the reorganization of communicative goals to enable aggregation while maintaining focus on objectives. 5.1.2 Resolving Conflict The ability to recognize and resolve conflict is in a text planner because appearance and resolution of conflict can be the of text structure. and resolves a class of domain-independent conflict, with the resolution strategies dependent upon the social relationship between the user and the system. In addition, the system allows the user to add rules for domain-specific classes of conflict. One class of conflict that can best be resolved at the text planning level results from implicit messages in text. Resolving conflict of this kind within independent modules of a critiquing system would require sharing extensive knowledge, thereby violating modularity concepts and making the planning process much more complex. For example, suppose that the user has conveyed an intention to achieve a particular objective by performing act A. One system module might post the communicative goal of getting user to recognize that act must precede while a different module posts the goal of getting the user to achieve the objective by executing A, instead of A. While each of these communicative goals might be well-motivated and coherent in isolation, together they are insince the first presumes that will be executed, while the second recommends retracting the intention to perform A. A text planner with access to both of these top-level goals their text plans recognize this implicit conflict and revise and integrate the text plans to resolve it. There are many ways to unambiguously resolve this class of implicit conflict. Strategy sedepends on the relationship between the system and the user, as captured by of settings. This relationship is defined by the relative levels of knowledge, expertise, and responsibility of the system and user. Three strategies used by our system, and their motivations, are: communicative goals that implicitly conflict with a system recommendation. In the above example, this would result in a text plan that only recommends doing A,</abstract>

This may be appropriate if the parameters indicate the user has more complete knowledge and more expertise. 5.1.3 Exploiting Related Goals Occasionally two text plans may exhibit no conflict, yet the relationships between their communicative goals can be exploited to produce more coherent text. For example, consider the following two individual critiques produced by TraumaTIQ: (Bel User (Reason (In-Order{ AO) (Al)) RI)) N (Inform User (Reason (In-Order{ AO) Al )) RI)) (because RI). 5: Input to Figure 4). Caution: do a peritoneal lavage immediately as part of ruling out abdominal bleeding. Do not reassess the patient in 6 to 24 hours until after doing a peritoneal lavage. The outcome of the latter may affect the need to do the former. 516 the two critiques do not conflict, rules exploit the relation between the communicative goals in their respective text plans to produce a more concise and coherent message. particular, one of recognizes the interaction between an initial plan to get the user to perform an action A,, and a second plan that gets the user to recognize a dependency between A, and another action. This rule creates a text plan for the message: Do a peritoneal lavage immediately as part of ruling out abdominal bleeding. Use the results of the peritoneal lavage to decide whether to reassess the patient in 6 to 24 hours. 5.2 Trailing Comments Occasionally when several text plans are integrated into a single text plan, another text plan that overlaps with the integrated plan will remain outside the new plan because the scoring function for the applicable rule was too low to allow it to combine. This is typically because an effort to integrate such a text plan would create a message so complex that the heuristic deemed it inappropriate. However, once concepts have been introduced in the integrated text plan, focusing heuristics (McKeown, 1985) suggest that other text plans containing these concepts be included in the integrated plan as well. Rather than restructure the result of our transformation (against the advice of our heuristic), we append them to the end of the message. Thus we refer to them as trailing comments. Unfortunately, when the communicative goal is to get the user to perform an action, trailing comments that refer to such actions have the potential to erroneously suggest new instances of actions. Our solution to this problem is implemented in the text realization templates, where the focused action the subject of sentence, reflecting its in the discourse, (2) utilize clue words to call attention to its occurrence earlier in the message and to the new information being conveyed, and (3) subordinate other concepts presented with the focused concept by placing them in a phrase introduced by the cue words &amp;quot;along with&amp;quot;. In one such example from the trauma domain, the main text plan contains the communicative goal of getting the user to perform several actions, a laparotomy. A is used to adjoin an overlapping text plan as a trailing comment, and this additional communicative goal is realized in English as (clue words underlined): TraumaTIQ critiques: Performing local visual exploration of all abdominal wounds is preferred over doing a peritoneal lavage for ruling out a suspicious abdominal wall injury. Please remember to check for laparotomy scars before you do a peritoneal lavage. from plan: Performing local visual exploration of all abdominal wounds is preferred over doing a peritoneal lavage for ruling out a suspicious abdominal wall injury.

Moreover,doing the laparotomy is also indiwithrepairing the left diaphragm, to treat the lacerated left diaphragm. rule-based integration of a set of RST-style trees. Rules are applied in an order designed to maximize derived benefit. The system first applies the rules that resolve conflict, since we hypothesize that the presence of conflict will most seriously hamper assimilation of a message. Next, the rules that exploit relations between text plans are tried because they enhance coherence by explicitly connecting different communicative goals. Then the aggregation rules are applied to improve conciseness. Finally, the rules for trailing comments reduce the number of disconnected message units. The algorithm is both greedy and anytime (Garvey and Lesser, 1994); it takes the best result from a single application of a rule to a set of text plans, and then attempts to further apply rules to the modified set. The rule instantiation with the highest heuristic score is chosen and the rule&apos;s operator is applied to the trees using those bindings. Since the rules are designed to apply incrementally to a set, every application of a rule results in an improvement in the conciseness or coherence of the tree set, and the tree set is always a viable set of text plans. The user can thus set a time limit for processing of a tree set, and the algorithm can return an improved set at any time. In practice, however, the processing has never taken more than 1-2 seconds, even for large (25 plans) input sets. 517 7 Results tested the corpus of critiques generated by TraumaTIQ. A set of critiques was extracted from the middle of each of 48 trauma cases, and RST-style text plans were automatigenerated for all the critiques. Then ran each set, and messages resulting from a realization of plans were analyzed for conciseness and coherence. We are currently using templates for sentence realization since we have been working in the domain of trauma care, where fast real-time response is essential. There was a 18% reduction in the average number of individual text plans in the 48 sets examined. The results for individual sets ranged from no integration in cases where all of the text plans were independent of one another, to a 60% reduction in sets that were heavily inter-related. More concise messages also resulted from a 12% reduction in the number of references to the diagnostic and therapeutic actions and objectives that are the subject of this domain. The new text plans also allowed some references to be replaced by pronouns during realization, making the messages shorter and more natural. To evaluate coherence, messages from twelve were presented, in randomly ordered blind pairs, to three human subjects not affiliated with our project. The written instructions given to the subjects instructed them to note whether one set of messages was more comprehensible, and if so, to note why. Two subjects preferred the new messages in 11 of 12 cases, and one subject preferred them in all cases. All the messages produced from the integrated text plan 69% of the time. 8 Summary Integration of multiple text plans is a task that will become increasingly necessary as independent modules of sophisticated systems are required to communicate with a user.

TraumaTIQ (Gertner and Webber, 1996) is a module that infers a physician&apos;s plan for managing patient care, compares it to TraumAID&apos;s plan, and critiques significant differences between them. TraumaTIQ recognizes four classes of differences: errors of omission, errors of commission, scheduling errors, and procedure choice errors. Experimentation with TraumaTIQ showed that when the physician&apos;s plan is deficient, several problems are generally detected, and thus multiple critiques are independently produced. 512 We analyzed 5361 individual critiques comprising 753 critique sets produced by TraumaTIQ on actual cases of trauma care. </context>

RTPI has a set of system parameters that capture these environmental factors. These parameters affect what rules are applied, and in some cases how they are applied. They allow characteristics of the output text plans to be tailored to broad classes of domains, giving the system the flexibility to be effective over a wide range of problems. 513 5 The Rule-Base RTPI&apos;s input consists of a set of text plans, each of which has a top-level communicative goal. Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1987) posits that a coherent text plan consists of segments related to one another by rhetorical relations such as MOTIVATION Or BACKGROUND. Each text plan presented to RTPI is a tree structure in which individual nodes are related by RST-style relations.

This is typically because an effort to integrate such a text plan would create a message so complex that the heuristic deemed it inappropriate. However, once concepts have been introduced in the integrated text plan, focusing heuristics (McKeown, 1985) suggest that other text plans containing these concepts be included in the integrated plan as well. Rather than restructure the result of our transformation (against the advice of our heuristic), we append them to the end of the message. Thus we refer to them as trailing comments. Unfortunately, when the communicative goal is to get the user to perform an action, trailing comments that refer to such actions have the potential to erroneously suggest new instances of actions. Our solution to this problem is implemented in the text realization templates, where we (1) make the focused action the </context>
