Content selection is a key factor of any
successful document generation system.
This paper shows how a content selection
algorithm has been implemented using an
efficient combination of XML/XSL
technology and the framework of RST for
discourse modeling. The system generates
multilingual documents adapted to user
profiles in a learning environment for the
web. This CourseViewGenerator applies
simplified RST schemes to the elaboration
of a master document in XML from which
content segments are chosen to suit the
user&apos;s needs. The personalisation of the
document is achieved through the
application of a sequence of filtering levels
of text selection based on the user aspects
given as input. These cascading filters are
implemented in XSL.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997325">
It is widely accepted that content selection
plays a crucial role in text generation (Reiter
and Dale 2000). This process is normally seen
as a goal-directed activity in which text
segments are fit into the discourse structure of
the text so as to convey a coherent
communicative goal (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
Content planning techniques, such as textual
schemas (McKeown 1985) or plan operators
(Moore and Paris 1993), have been successfully
used as models of text generation. There are
cases, though, in which these techniques may
face some limitations, for example, when the
structure of the discourse is difficult to
anticipate (Mellish et al. 1998). Nevertheless,
when a set of well-defined communicative
goals exists, complex goals can be broken down
into sequences of utterances and generation
becomes an efficient &amp;quot;top-down&amp;quot; process
(Marcu 1997).
This paper shows a macro level content
selection algorithm that applies user profiles to
constrain and discriminate the contents of a
text, whose discourse structure is represented
using a simplified version of Rhetorical
Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson 1988).
The algorithm has been implemented using
XML/XSL-based technology in a multilingual
document generation system for educational
purposes. The main objective of this
CourseViewGenerator system (Barrutieta, 2001
and Barrutieta et al., 2001) is to automatically
produce multilingual learning documents that
suit the student&apos;s needs at each particular stage
of the learning process. Figure 1 shows the
overall architecture of the system.

We will begin by explaining the different
parts of the system before addressing in more
detail the content selection algorithm itself. The
system starts by constructing a master
document of the kind Hirst et al. (1997)
proposed. This master document consists in a
full-fledged text with references to all necessary
multimedia elements (figures, tables, pictures,
links, etc.). In our case, this master document
takes the shape of a simple text file with all
relevant information tagged in XML. Tags
carry information of the logical composition of
the text as well as metadata information about

its discourse structure. The text is seen as raw
data, and tags encapsulate these raw data as
metadata. The structure of the discourse is
represented using a simplified version of RST.
RST is simplified in the sense that the
granularity of discourse segments does not
transcend the boundaries of the sentence.
Table 1. illustrates this gross-grained
version of RST in which discourse relations are
represented as XML tags.

As any other standard RST discourse tree,
this simplified RST contains a nucleus for each
text paragraph, and one or several satellites
linked by a discourse relation to the nucleus
within the same paragraph. The nucleus is an
absolutely essential segment of the text, as it
carries the main message that the author wants
to convey. Satellites can be replaced or erased
without changing the overall message and play
an important supporting role for the nucleus.
In our system, satellites are selected or
discarded depending on the reader’s profile.
The reader’s profile is defined through a set of
user aspects. These take the form of multi-
value parameters that were sketched after a
number of surveys were conducted among
teachers, students and other experts from the
educational context. As a result of these surveys
a user model was proposed (Barrutieta et al,
2002). Table 2 illustrates a simplified version of
the model.

Based on this user model, we will now
discuss the content selection algorithm
(henceforth CSA). The CSA determines which
segments of the discourse are going to be used
in order to make explicit the set of parameters
that conform with the user’s profile. In
principle, nuclei will always be chosen (as they
convey the main message of the text); satellites,
however, will be selected depending on their
relation to the nucleus and the user aspects that
are activated at the time of generation.
The selection algorithm works in three
consecutive phases: parallel selection,
horizontal filtering and vertical filtering.
Vertical filtering is the most important phase of
the three as it is here that the parts of the
discourse tree are selected or discarded.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.870545" genericHeader="method">
1 CSA - Parallel selection - Phase 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982488">
In the phase of parallel selection two of the
three specific user aspects are taken into
account: subject and languages. These aspects
identify the relevant XML master document in
the chosen language (as illustrated in figure 2.).
There is one master document for each subject
covered by the system, and these documents
contain parallel aligned versions of the texts in
each language (English, Spanish and Basque, in
our case).
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.994742">
Figure 2: CSA – Parallel selection
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999852333333333">
As a result of this first filtering phase, the
appropriate language division of the master
document is selected. This text division is the
input for subsequent filtering phases in which
the particular segments of the document will be
discriminated.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.941508" genericHeader="method">
2 CSA - Horizontal filtering - Phase 2
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859">
The horizontal filtering phase concerns the third
remaining user aspect that is moment in time,
which is used to suit the generated text to the
particular moment of the learning plan. This
aspect cuts horizontally the parallel selection of
the previous section.
The master document is structured in
accordance with a set of course scheduling
parameters. Each day and learning unit within
the day is correlated with corresponding set of
learning entities in the XML master document.
In this way, the generated document can be
targeted for learning unit 1 of day 1, or any
other day or unit. The XML master file also
contains some informative elements that the
reader may need to know even before the
course starts or after it has finished. These will
be generated also as a result of some specific
user aspects that are activated. Figure 3 shows a
graphical representation of horizontal filtering.

3 CSA - Vertical filtering - Phase 3
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.876821153846154">
The final phase of vertical filtering comprises
the five user aspects of level expertise, reason
to read, professional background, opinion or
motivation and time available. These five
aspects will be relevant to discriminate those
parts of the discourse tree which have been
previously selected and filtered.
Nuclei will be always maintained because
they are, by definition, irreplaceable segments
of the text and convey the main message.
Satellites are segments of the text that will be
subject to the algorithm&apos;s process of selection.
Figure 4. shows graphically this filtering phase.

The set of discrimination rules applied in
this first version of the content selection
algorithm is described below. These rules apply
in subsequent checking levels of filtering, and
therefore have a cascading effect. It is known
that RST covers an indefinite number of
relation-satellites (Knott, 1995) which have
been classified by Hovy &amp; Maier (1997), but
we will only mention the set of relation-
satellites used in the master document taken as
example.

level_expertise = “basic” Then
no relation-satellite is discarded;
If level_expertise = “medium” or

Rationale for the rule: Any user with a null
or basic level of expertise on the selected
subject will need all the information available
to understand the text. Alternatively, a user with
a medium or high level of expertise will not
require examples, exercises, background,
preparation and similar relation-satellites.

If reason_to_read = “to get deep into it”Then
no relation-satellite is discarded;
Rationale: Any user wishing to broaden his
knowledge in the selected subject will need
additional information. Conversely, a user with
the intention of just getting an idea does not
need any exercise, elaboration, or similar
relation-satellites, which often require a more
active role on the part of the user.

Rationale: Any user whose professional
background is not related to the subject will
need all the additional supporting text to
understand its meaning. Conversely, if the user
is related to the selected subject, we may
assume that background, preparation and
similar relation-satellites will be unnecessary.

Rationale: A motivated or favourable user
will not require additional motivation and,
therefore, the motivate, antithesis, concession,
justification, and similar relation-satellites will
be disregarded, since they play a role in
changing the opinion of the user to be in favour
of the course material.

Rationale: Time availability is a crucial user
aspect. If the user is in a rush or has little time,
the system has to provide only the most
elementary information. In such case only
nuclei will be generated. If the user has a bit
more time, but not much, exercises are not
offered, since they are usually quite time
consuming and they require an active
participation of the user. Finally, if the user has
plenty of time, all the additional information is
delivered.

3.6 Final comments on vertical filters
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999543125">
Cascading filters apply to the relation-
satellites that are still active after the previous
phases in the generation process. When a
vertical filter 3 tries to get rid of a relation-
satellite already abandoned at a previous phase
(2 or 1), there will be nothing to act upon, but
this circumstance will produce no consequence,
since the CSA continues the filtering process on
the remaining text. Thus, the order in which the
vertical filters are applied is not relevant.
After the filtering process has been
successfully completed, there is still a final
presentation task. A good presentation is, in our
opinion, one that will provide the student with
an optimal version of the document to read,
understand and fruitfully assimilate its content.

4 Implementation

The javascript code manages the user aspects
(one of the inputs of the algorithm) and the
application of the casdading filters (the CSA).
Depending on the user aspects given by the
user, the variables sXSL1 to sXSL5 take the
value of the filter to be applied for each user
aspect (level of expertise, reason to read,
background, opinion or motivation and time
available).
The sResult variable contains the XML file
whose content will be varying after each filter is
applied. Table 3 shows the code that executes a
filter.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983909090909">
The objective of the experiment is to validate
the hypothesis expressed in the filtering rules
and the actual filtering mechanism of the CSA.
Several ideas are taken into consideration in
this respect, but we are aware that users
(students, professor and other scholars) are the
final judges. Their assessment of the system
will depend on whether the generated document
meet (or fail to do so) their information
requirements, providing them with just the right
type and amount of information.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.745371">
Conclusions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999115625">
In the tests conducted so far, the
CourseViewGenerator is functioning correctly.
One of the features that is worth considering is
the scalability of the filtering mechanism. We
anticipate two types of expansions to the
system: (1) Increasing the size of the corpus,
including more subjects and master documents,
and (2) augmenting the user model by adding
user aspects or by adding more parameters to
the existing user aspects.
The first type of expansion will not require
any alteration of the CSA as long as the added
document tokens conform to the existing DTD
and our RST model. In order to increase the
size of the corpus, it will be necessary to
annotate XML discourse-tree metadata
manually. This is a complex and time-
consuming task (as has been noted by Carlson
and Marcu, 2001). Future research activities
should focus on helping automate the
annotation process, for example using cue
phrases à la Knott (Knott 1995; Alonso and
Castellón, 2001).
The second type of expansion requires only
the elaboration of additional XSL filters.
Adding new values to existing user aspects
requires only the modification of the
corresponding XSL filter. Any of these last two
operations can be incorporated easily.
Therefore, adding a new user aspect or a new
discrete value does not increase in any
substantial way the complexity of the system.

Satellites can be replaced or erased without changing the overall message and play an important supporting role for the nucleus. In our system, satellites are selected or discarded depending on the reader’s profile. The reader’s profile is defined through a set of user aspects. These take the form of multivalue parameters that were sketched after a number of surveys were conducted among teachers, students and other experts from the educational context. As a result of these surveys a user model was proposed (Barrutieta et al, 2002). Table 2 illustrates a simplified version of the model.
