This paper proposed a new query translation
method based on the mutual information
matrices of terms in the Chinese and
English corpora. Instead of looking up a
bilingual phrase dictionary, the
compositional phrase (the translation of
phrase can be derived from the translation
of its components) in the query can be
indirectly translated via a general-purpose
Chinese-English dictionary look-up
procedure. A novel selection method for
translations of query terms is also presented
in detail. Our query translation method
ultimately constructs an English query in
which each query term has a weight. The
evaluation results show that the retrieval
performance achieved by our query
translation method is about 73% of
monolingual information retrieval and is
about 28% higher than that of simple word-
by-word translation way.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999886461538462">
With the rapid growth of electronic documents
and the great development of network in China,
there are more and more people touching the
Internet, on which, however, English is the most
popular language being used. It is difficult for
most people in China to use English fluently, so
they would like to use Chinese to express their
queries to retrieval the relevant English
documents. This situation motivates research in
Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR).
There are two approaches to CUR, one is
query translation; the other is translating
original language documents to destination

language equivalents. Obviously, the latter is a
very expensive task since there are so many
documents in a collection and there is not yet a
reliable machine translation system that can be
used to process automatically. Most researchers
are inclined to choose the query translation
approach [Oard. (1996)]. Methods for query
translation have focused on three areas: the
employment of machine translation techniques,
dictionary based translation [Hull &amp;
Grefenstette (1996); Ballesteros &amp; Croft (1996)],
parallel or comparable corpora for generating
a translation model [Davis &amp; Dunning (1995);
Sheridan &amp; Ballerini (1996); Nie, Jian-Yun et
al.(1999)]. Machine translation (MT) method
has many obstacles to prevent its employment
into CLIR such as deep syntactic and semantic
analysis, user queries consisting of only one or
two words, and an arduous task to build a MT
system. Dictionary based query translation is the
most popular method because of its easiness to
perform. The main reasons leading to the great
drops in CUR effectiveness by this method are
ambiguities caused by more than one translation
of a query term and failures to translate phrases
during query translation. Previous studies [Hull
&amp; Grefenstette (1996); Ballesteros &amp; Croft
(1996)] have shown that automatic word-by-
word (WBW) query translation via machine
readable dictionary (MRD) results in a 40-60%
loss in effectiveness below that of monolingual
retrieval. With regard to the use of parallel
corpora translation method, the critiques one
often raises concern the availability of reliable
parallel text corpora. An alternative way is that
making use of the comparable corpora because
they are easier to be obtained and there are more
and more bilingual even multilingual documents
on the Internet. From analyzing a document
collection, an associated word list can be
yielded and it is often used to expansion the
query in monolingual information retrieval [Qiu
&amp; Frei(1993); Jing &amp; Croft(1994)].

In this paper, a new query translation is
presented by combination dictionary based
method with the comparable corpora analyzing.
Ambiguity problem and phrase information lost
are attacked in dictionary based Chinese-
English Cross-Language information Retrieval
(CECLIR). The remainder of this paper is
organized as follows: section 1 gives a method
to calculate the mutual information matrices of
Chinese-English comparable corpora. Section 2
develops a scheme to select the translations of
the Chinese query terms and introduces how the
compositional phrase can be kept in our method.
Section 3 presents a set of preliminary
experiment on comparable corpora to evaluate
our query translation method and gives some

We hypothesize that the words in a sentence
after being removed the stop words be
associated with each other and work together to
express a query requirement. The association
relationship between two words can be
indicated by their mutual information, which
can be further used to discover phrases [Church
&amp; Hanks (1990)]. If two words are independent
with each other, their mutual information would
be close to zero. On the other hand, if they are
strongly related, the mutual information would
be much greater than zero and they would be
much like to be a phrase; if they occur
complementarily, the mutual information would
be negative. In conclusion; the bigger the
mutual information of word pair, the more
probable the word phrase would be a phrase.
According to [Fano (1961)], we can define the
mutual information M./ (t1, t2) of term t1 and

select a Chinese sentence to be a window other
than a fixed length window is that a full Chinese
sentence can keep more linguistic information
and consequently, it is more reasonable that we
can regard t1 and t2 to be a phrase when they
co-occur in a sentence. P(tI) and P(t2) are
the occurrence probabilities of term t1 and t2
in a sentence. These probabilities can be
calculated by the occurrence of term ti and t2
in the collection as equation (2), (3) and (4).

would be most possible to be a phrase. A word
list associated to each Chinese query term can
be obtained by looking up the mutual
information value matrix of the Chinese corpus
with a cutoff of MI =1.50 . As discussed
above, the bigger the mutual information value
between two terms, the more possible the two
words would be a phrase. We can infer that the
associated word list of the query term contains
the terms that are the most possible components
of a compositional phrase. In other words, the
phrase information can be kept by this way. The
Chinese query is translated into English via
looking up the English senses of Chinese query
term and words in its associated word list in a
Chinese-English dictionary. The procedures
how to select appropriate tranlations and to
construct the English query are discussed in
section 2.

2 Translations selection and phrase
keeping
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916828571428">
It is a naive method to translate a Chinese query
only by looking up each Chinese term to get its
English senses in a Chinese-English dictionary.
This method, however, results in too many
ambiguities during the query translation and
offers no path to select appropriate ones among
the translations. In addition, phrases in the query
can not be translated effectively. Previous study
has showed that failure to translate phrases
greatly reduces the performance by up to 25%
over automatic word-by-word (WBW) query
translation [Ballesteros &amp; Croft (1996)].
In our method, those English translations
most likely co-occur with each other can be
obtained via looking up the mutual information
value matrix of the English corpus with a cutoff
MI =1.50 . In this way, the English senses of
terms in the associated word list can provide a
good context for the translation of the Chinese
query term and give a significant clue for its
translations selection. In addition, the
information of two terms (either Chinese or
English) to be a phrase can also be stored in the
associated word list. In the following, we firstly
describe our method to select translations in
detail, and then we give an example to
demonstrate how to keep the phrase information
in our method.
Supposing the Chinese query is expressed by
(e1 , e2, • -,e,.). are the segmented
Chinese words of the query after removing the
stop words. The translations of
em (m=1,...,r) by looking up the Chinese-
English bilingual dictionary can be ordered in
descending by following formula.

.f,:z is one sense of the English translation set
Fm of the word e,,, (I E. is the
association word set of e.. The size of E. is
IE. I and its element is e,,,, (k .
Fmk is the English translation set of emk, its
element is f4. a is the coefficient to
emphasize the inner mutual information
between the English sense f,&amp;quot;, of the single
Chinese query term em and the English sense
f,&amp;quot;,;, of the em&apos;s association word e.k. The
first part of the formula (6) i )
reflects the probability of English translation
f,,; and f&amp;quot;,,, to be a phrase. 13 is the
coefficient to emphasize the outside mutual
information between f„ and the English sense
f,k of the other Chinese terms included in the
query. The second part of the formula (6)
o _MI(f.1) reflects the relevant value between
the English sense f,&amp;quot;, of en, and the whole
query concept.
Our method of translations selection can be
described as follows: if the weight of any
translation of the Chinese query term is greater
than 1.00, the sense is selected to construct the
English query. If there is no weight of any
translation of the Chinese query term greater
than 1.00, the sense with biggest one is selected
to construct the English query. In this way, we
can make an English query by the following
Boolean expression.

Where gl„, is set element after the English
translation sense set Fm which is detnnicated
by our translation selection method.
In order to demonstrate the procedure of our
method, we give an example and explain how
the English translations are selected and how the
phrase information is kept. Given a simple
Chinese query &amp;quot; 13&apos; , 3.1 , (user,
management, command)&amp;quot; after segmentation
and removing stop words, the associated word
list of term &amp;quot;Jfl A (user)&amp;quot; is &amp;quot; g
(management) , It 4 (information) ,
(manual)&amp;quot; and the associated word list of term
g(management)&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;AA (user), Akit (hard
disk),..4-1-(file)&amp;quot;. We process the associated
word &amp;quot;t (management)&amp;quot; of the query term
&amp;quot;A A (user)&amp;quot; in a special way by adding an
appropriate value to their mutual information
value to let theirs be the biggest in the
associated word list, because the associated
word &amp;quot;(management)&amp;quot; also occurs in the
original query. Similar way is done with the
associated word &amp;quot;A A (user)&amp;quot; of the query term
&amp;quot;f g (management)&amp;quot;. In this way„ the
compositional phrase &amp;quot; A fg (user
management)&amp;quot; can be kept in both associated
word list of term &amp;quot;Al A (user)&amp;quot; and term &amp;quot;f!
(management)&amp;quot;.
When term &amp;quot;Ifl &amp;quot; is translated into English
by looking up the general-purpose Chinese-
English bilingual dictionary, we get its English
sense set &amp;quot;user, consumer&amp;quot; ordered by the
formula (6). When term &amp;quot;*11&amp;quot; is translated
into English, we get its English sense set
&amp;quot;management, administration, supervision, run&amp;quot;
ordered by the formula (6). We can find the first
positions of the English translation set of the
query term &amp;quot;AI &amp;quot; and term &amp;quot;* g&amp;quot; are &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;management&amp;quot; respectively. From the point
of view of translation, the phrase &amp;quot;user
management&amp;quot; can be regarded as the English
phrase translation of &amp;quot;fiflA ta&amp;quot;. According to
our translation selection and formula (9), we can
construct the English Boolean query as follows,
in which each query term has a weight.
Query = (user, 1.86) and ((management, 1.83)
or (administration, 1.63)) and (command, 1.92).

3 Evaluation and discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99966368">
To evaluate our query translation method, we
did a set of experiment to compare it to the
word-by-word (WBW) translation method and
manual translation method. In the word-by-
word translation method, the Chinese queries
are automatically segmented and the Chinese
terms included in them are translated into
English only by looking up the general-purpose
Chinese-English bilingual dictionary. In the
manual translation method, the Chinese queries
are translated into English by a Ph.D. student.
The segmentation we used is based on a small
general-purpose Chinese-English bilingual
dictionary that only contains 46,570 pairs in
which each Chinese word has several English
translations. The forward and backward
maximum matching algorithm is used to
segment the texts and find the combinatorial
ambiguities. Of all the combinatorial
ambiguities, 91.2% are removed with the word
uni-gam prior probabilities. A stop word list of
1210 elements is set up, which contains
frequently used functional words as well as
symbols [Du &amp; Sun (2000)]. Our Chinese query
translation process contains following steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999865666666667">
(1) Segment the Chinese query according to the
method introduced above.
(2) Get the associated word list of each Chinese
term included in the query from the Chinese
mutual information matrix.

Chinese term and its associated word in the
general-purpose Chinese-English bilingual
dictionary.
(4) Select the English translation sense by the
method introduced in section 2 (in formula

experiment) and construct the English query
on the basis of the formula (9).
The document collection used in our
experiments consists of several Chinese and
corresponding English computer manuals,
which include Linux-HOWTO, PostgreSQL
handbook, Mysql handbook, Linux kernel* and
Linux Gazette 17 volumes (from July, 1998 to
Dec., 1999). In order get a large number
document Chinese and English collections, we
decomposed these manuals and let every
document no more than 15 sentences. As a

result, Chinese-English bilingual comparable
corpora are obtained in which contain about
8,200 Chinese documents and 12,500 English
documents. We design 13 Chinese queries, the
average length is about 7 single Chinese
character (about three Chinese words). All work
in this study was performed on the Search2000
information retrieval system [Du &amp; Zhang
(2000)], which can process both Chinese and
English Boolean queries.
Table 4 shows the precision and recall table for
the three methods. The first column in table 4
contains precision values averaged 13 queries and
interpolated to eleven recall points from 0.0 to 1.0
in steps of 0.1. The third column contains
precision values achieved by our translation
method (QT).
The results in table 4 suggest that in this case,
the WBW query translation leads to a great drop
in effectiveness of 42.90% below that for
monolingual retrieval (manual translation
method). The result of our query translation
method greatly improves effectiveness by
28.22% over the WBW method, and its
effectiveness is about 73.21% of that for
monolingual retrieval. Although phrase
translation is not executed directly in our
method, the phrase information is kept
effectively in the associated word list. Therefore,
the phrase can be well translated. The associated
word list also provides a good context for
translation of the Chinese query terms
(corresponding to the first part of formula (6)
M/ (f.1)) and a good English translation is
given a relatively high weight. The results in
table 4 show that our query translation method
can construct a good English query and indeed
improve the effectiveness.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977823529412">
Automatic word-by-word query translation is an
attractive method because it is easy to perform,
resources are readily available, and performance
is similar to that of other CLIR methods.
However, there are a lot of ambiguities in
translation of the query terms and failures to
translate phrases correctly, which are mainly
responsible for the large drops in effectiveness
below monolingual retrieval performance.
Aiming to tackle with these problems, we
develop a new scheme for how to select
translations in this paper. In addition, rather than
using a bilingual phrase dictionary, we also put
forward a new method to translate phrases
indirectly by using the mutual information
between two words in a full sentence and keep
the phrase information in the associated word
list effectively. As a result of our query
translation method, an English query is
constructed in which each query term has a
weight.
In this study, our method leads to improve
the effectiveness by 28.22% over the word by
word query translation method, but is still about
27% below the monolingual retrieval
performance. If query expansion is employed in
our method, we expect the performance should
be further improved. A shortcoming of our
method is that the cost of calculation of the
mutual information matrices is very large. We
are currently exploring an algorithm to generate
the matrices more efficiently and the selection
of coefficients in formula (6) also needs further
research.

<abstract confidence="0.999225136363636">This paper proposed a new query translation method based on the mutual information matrices of terms in the Chinese and English corpora. Instead of looking up a bilingual phrase dictionary, compositional phrase (the translation of phrase can be derived from the translation of its components) in the query can be indirectly translated via a general-purpose Chinese-English dictionary procedure. A novel selection method for translations of query terms is also presented in detail. Our query translation method ultimately constructs an English query in which each query term has a weight. The evaluation results show that the retrieval performance achieved by our query translation method is about 73% of monolingual information retrieval and is about 28% higher than that of simple wordby-word translation way.</abstract>

Section 3 presents a set of preliminary experiment on comparable corpora to evaluate our query translation method and gives some explanations. 1 Mutual information matrices calculation We hypothesize that the words in a sentence after being removed the stop words be associated with each other and work together to express a query requirement. The association relationship between two words can be indicated by their mutual information, which can be further used to discover phrases [Church &amp; Hanks (1990)]. If two words are independent with each other, their mutual information would be close to zero. On the other hand, if they are strongly related, the mutual information would be much greater than zero and they would be much like to be a phrase; if they occur complementarily, the mutual information would be negative. In conclusion; the bigger the mutual information of word pair, the more probable the word phrase would be a phrase. According to [Fano (1961)], we can define the mutual information M./ (t1, t2) of term t1 and t2 as formula (1). P(t,,t2) MI(t,,t2). log2 (1) POI )P(t2 ) Where P(ti ,</context>

Obviously, the latter is a very expensive task since there are so many documents in a collection and there is not yet a reliable machine translation system that can be used to process automatically. Most researchers are inclined to choose the query translation approach [Oard. (1996)]. Methods for query translation have focused on three areas: the employment of machine translation techniques, dictionary based translation [Hull &amp; Grefenstette (1996); Ballesteros &amp; Croft (1996)], parallel or comparable corpora for generating a translation model [Davis &amp; Dunning (1995); Sheridan &amp; Ballerini (1996); Nie, Jian-Yun et al.(1999)]. Machine translation (MT) method has many obstacles to prevent its employment into CLIR such as deep syntactic and semantic analysis, user queries consisting of only one or two words, and an arduous task to build a MT system. Dictionary based query translation is the most popular method because of its easiness to perform. The main reasons leading to the great drops in CUR effectiveness by this method are ambiguities caused by more than one translation of a query term and failures to translate phrases during query translation.

The segmentation we used is based on a small general-purpose Chinese-English bilingual dictionary that only contains 46,570 pairs in which each Chinese word has several English translations. The forward and backward maximum matching algorithm is used to segment the texts and find the combinatorial ambiguities. Of all the combinatorial ambiguities, 91.2% are removed with the word uni-gam prior probabilities. A stop word list of 1210 elements is set up, which contains frequently used functional words as well as symbols [Du &amp; Sun (2000)]. Our Chinese query translation process contains following steps: (1) Segment the Chinese query according to the method introduced above. (2) Get the associated word list of each Chinese term included in the query from the Chinese mutual information matrix. (3) Look up the English sense set of each Chinese term and its associated word in the general-purpose Chinese-English bilingual dictionary. (4) Select the English translation sense by the method introduced in section 2 (in formula (6) the coefficents a and /3 are selected by 1.0 and 0.5 respectively in our experiment) and construct the Eng</context>

The reason we select a Chinese sentence to be a window other than a fixed length window is that a full Chinese sentence can keep more linguistic information and consequently, it is more reasonable that we can regard t1 and t2 to be a phrase when they co-occur in a sentence. P(tI) and P(t2) are the occurrence probabilities of term t1 and t2 in a sentence. These probabilities can be ca</context>
