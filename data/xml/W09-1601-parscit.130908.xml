The problem of providing people with the informa-
tion that they seek when that information happens
to be in an unfamiliar language is not new. Rather,
what is new is what we can do to help address that
challenge. To illustrate this point, I’ll start my talk
with a brief recap of two earlier generations of
automated support for cross-language information
access, the first from roughly 1964 to 1985, and
the second from roughly 1989 to the present. With
that as background, I’ll then take stock of where
we are, and where I see unmet needs that call for
capabilities beyond what can currently be accom-
plished. I’ll conclude with a few observations
about how we might expect the role of the research
community to evolve as progressively more capa-
ble cross-language information access technologies
become commercially viable.
language information retrieval, his recent research
has focused on support for search and sense mak-
ing in large collections of conversational media.
