1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999983166666667">
As an important feature of the communication of
meaning in English, intonation of other non-native
English varieties have also begun to receive
interest and attention. At the Hong Kong
Polytechnic University, we are attempting to
describe the communicative role of intonation in
Hong Kong English. By uncovering the similarities
and differences of intonation patterns between
native and Hong Kong speakers of English, we
will be in a position to describe how Hong Kong
speakers make use of intonation to communicate
meanings, and find out whether or not there is a
systematic pattern which we can name “The
Intonation system of Hong Kong English”. The
findings will hopefully better inform our
understanding of Hong Kong English and help the
development of English language learning and
teaching materials directed at discourse intonation.

2 Our Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996165">
Spoken discourses between native speakers of
English and Hong Kong Chinese have been
recorded as a first step to build up the Hong Kong
Corpus of Spoken English (HKCSE). The HKCSE
is divided into four sub-corpora: conversations,
business discourses, academic discourses and
public discourses. Each sub-corpora consists of 50
hours of naturally-occurring discourses. The
participants are monitored in terms of age, gender,
nationality, occupation, educational backgrounds
and residence overseas.

3 The Transcription System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981008023255814">
Data collected are first orthographically
transcribed. The intonation system proposed by
David Brazil (1997) known as the Brazil System is
being used for the prosodic transcription of data
manually. This is a discourse-based system that
suits our need of describing Hong Kong intonation
along with discourse features. Below are the labels
adopted from the Brazil System of intonation:
Prominence: Capitalised letters
Tone: p (fall), r (fall-rise), p+ (rise-fall), r+
(rise), o (level), u (unfinished utterances)
Key and termination: hl and ll, stands for high
key /termination and
low key/termina-tion
respectively
Tone unit boundaries: //
Prominence refers to the stressed syllables.
Tone is the tonic or nucleus in a tone unit (i.e. the
last prominent syllable of a tone unit), and either
the letters are capitalised or underlined, the latter is
for cases in which more stressed syllables follow
the tonic. Key and termination refer to the key of
the first stressed syllable and the tonic respectively.
A system for computer labelling has also been
developed:
Fig 1. Computer speech file of sample
conversation between a male native speaker and
male non-native speaker
The program used for the purpose of computer
transcription is ‘xwaves’, a package developed as a
research tool for all kinds of acoustic analysis. The
recording process is followed by this computer
labelling using Brazil’s paradigm along with the
orthographic transcription. As can be seen from the
above speech file, orthographic transcriptions are
put in alternate columns, with the intonation
notations above. Only the capitalised onset syllable
(the first prominent syllable of the tone group) and
the tonic (indicated by p, p+, r, r+ or o) of each
tone unit are inserted.
Statistical analysis has also been carried out for
part of the conversation sub-corpus of
conversations:

<bodyText confidence="0.997509909090909">
It can be seen that there is a dominant use of
the level tone o and proclaiming tone p among
Hong Kong speakers of English. Contrast is also
seen in the use of the referring tone r between the
two parties. Native-speaker data show more
instances of the referring tone. Another referring
tone r+ has more or less the same frequency of
occurrence in the two different sets of data. All
these will be viewed along with representative
examples extracted from the data concerned in the
sections that follow.

4 Description of Tone Choices
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990766">
In Brazil’s (1997) system of native-English
intonation, R and P stand for the referring and the
proclaiming tone respectively. They are further
subdivided into r and r+ (for R), and p and p+ (for
P).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.967006222222222">
A: What will you do on your day off?
B: // r WHEN i’ve prepared my LECture // r

1997:73)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997746">
This example shows the use of a fall-rise r to
indicate negotiated information/assumed common
ground, and p to signal new information. This
stands for the P/R opposition proposed by Brazil
(Brazil, 1997).

5. Preliminary Findings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.589691142857143">
Preliminary results from the conversation sub-
corpora show that the level tone is dominant and is
used in almost half of the tone units. Below is a
typical example:
A: // p WHAT’s the REAson // p for reCORding
us//
b: // p YEA // p SHE is DOing a phD PROject //
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993441125">

o in FACT ER // u IT IS ON THE aNAlysis

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.925693083333333">
anaLYSE MY ER // o in ONE SENTENCE //
p ER how i STRUCture MY WORDs //
At points where the speaker is obviously
signaling shared information, or information
already present in the consciousness of the two
parties (e.g. conversation, ordinary conversation,
in one sentence), the speaker uses the level tone o
instead of the referring fall-rise r.
The use of proclaiming tone is also dominant.
The next example presents us with a series of falls
(p)
a: // o beCAUSE // r IN PRINciple // p we should
ASK the conTRACtor // p PROject
conTRACtor // p the MAIN conTRACtor // o
to DO it// p to TOUCH up ALL THESE
FAULTs //
The “contractor” mentioned in the above
chunks should be understood as already present in
the consciousness of the hearer, for the
conversation parties have been discussing
construction matters. Subsequent “contractors”
would become old information which should be
used with a referring tone according to Brazil. But
here they are all said with a proclaiming tone p.

5.1 The Intonation of Questions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997666142857143">
It is claimed by Brazil that when native English
speakers echo what they have just heard or ask to
have an assumed common ground confirmed or
refuted, they use either a fall p or a rise r+. Below
are examples from the Hong Kong English data: (a:
Hong Kong male speaker, b: Hong Kong female
speaker)
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.411310416666667">

<bodyText confidence="0.999813857142857">
Preliminary results show that Hong Kong
speakers use both p and r+ in asking questions as
native speakers do.
Further, we have examined examples of yes/no
questions and information questions. This time the
P/R opposition in terms of information status
comes into play. According to Brazil (1997), p is
used when the question content is not yet the
negotiated common ground. On the other hand, r
and r+ are used when the question is put forward
as a presumed assumption. Some examples of the
transcribed data are as follows (Q stands for
“genuine questions”, meaning the speaker is asking
for information unknown to him/her:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.926394058823529">

a: // r+ IT’S BETTER //
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.969381823529412">
One point worth noting is the fact that speakers
tend to use a fall p more often in Wh-questions.
This is in line with Brazil’s (1997) proposal that
this type of question is asked using a fall because
the speaker has no idea about the answer. A rise r+
is associated with a considerable number of
questions that carry presumed assumptions.
However, as a general picture, it is not yet clear
whether Hong Kong speakers actually manipulate
the P/R opposition in asking questions as native
speakers do, since we do have instances of both the
P and R tone within the same category of questions.
This matter is further complicated by the
overwhelming use of level tones (Please refer to
table 1 above) which are frequent in questions as
well:
a: // o DO you LIKE CHInese GOOD //
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.415955">
a: // o ARE you also WORKING FIVE DAY
PER WEEK //
b: // u WILL IT AUTO // o AUTOMAtically // o
ER CAN GO TO THE // o TO THE SOUTH
AfriCA CONferENCE //
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999454833333333">
Use of the fall rise r is emphasised particularly
by Brazil (1997) as a means to indicate a presumed
common ground in asking questions. But r rarely
occurs in our Hong-Kong-speaker data. The
proclaiming tone p and the rising tone r+ are the
dominant tones for questions.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923807692308">
Preliminary results suggest that Hong Kong
speakers do use the full variety of tones in
speaking English. However this pattern of usage
seems to differ from that of NS (e.g. r is much
rarer and the level and proclaiming tones are
dominant). They seem to manipulate the choice in
the same way as native speakers in some of the
sub-categories (e.g. Wh-questions). However, we
have yet to establish whether Hong Kong speakers
make the same conscious distinction between p
and r. NNS’s frequent use of r+ in questions, for
example, may be due to a non-native speaker
intuition that a rise is the normal “question tone” in
English. Also, if future results reveal that there is
an overwhelming use of a fall p and a level o in
whatever situation, then we have no reason to
believe that there exists a native-like distinction.
On top of the main concern regarding whether
Hong Kong Chinese speakers deviate from native
speakers in terms of the use of tones (and if so,
how), it will be interesting to investigate also
whether Hong Kong Chinese speakers have
developed a Hong Kong English intonation system.
If so, it will better inform us the way to design
teaching materials geared towards discourse
intonation in English.
