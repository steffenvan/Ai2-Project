Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999984826086957">
Every day, we use language so effortlessly that we often overlook its complexity. The fact that language is
complex is indisputable. Indeed, even after decades of scrutiny, highly-trained adult scientists cannot agree
on a definitive analysis of the underlying mechanism that ultimately determines how our sounds, words, and
sentences go together – but such an effortless task for a child! Children as young as one-and-a-half-years-old
(and younger) continually exploit much of language’s underpinnings while going about the business of
making sense of the linguistic environment that surrounds them. By the time a child reaches kindergarten, he
or she has almost full mastery of an elaborate structure that eludes adequate scientific description. How
children accomplish this – how they come to acquire ‘knowledge’ of language’s essential organization – is
one of the most fundamental, beguiling, and surprisingly open questions of modern science.
This workshop brings together researchers whose (at least one) line of investigation is to computationally
model the acquisition process and ascertain substantive interrelationships between a model and linguistic and
psycholinguistic theory. Progress in this agenda not only directly informs developmental psycholinguistic
and linguistic research, but in my opinion, will also have the long term benefit of informing applied
computational linguistics in areas that involve the automated acquisition of knowledge from a human or
human-computer linguistic environment.
The level of sophistication and breadth of applied computational linguistics techniques has skyrocketed in
the past two decades. There is now a battery of computational formalisms and statistical methods to ‘choose
from,’ all which have yielded remarkable success in many applied domains that involve the computer
learning of natural language (e.g. speech recognition, web technologies, corpus analysis, etc). These
achievements have dramatically spurred even more research and funding to the point where the evolution of
the science of computational linguistics can be seen as quickly outpacing that of psycholinguistics.
However, there are signs that the computational linguistics community has been progressively more aware
that language technologies might benefit by incorporating learning strategies employed by humans. Although
research involving the psycho-computational modeling of human language acquisition has been long active
in the areas of psycholinguistics, cognitive science and formal learning theory, it has, arguably, only recently
become a growing part of the computational linguistics agenda. This is evidenced by the occasional special
session at an ACL meeting (e.g., ACL-1999 – Thematic Session on Computational Psycholinguistics),
current workshops at both COLING-2004 (this workshop) and ACL-2004 (Incremental Parsing: Bringing
Engineering and Cognition Together), and regular invitations to developmental psycholinguists to deliver
plenary addresses at recent ACL meetings. This cross-discipline attentiveness is clearly very healthy and
might well help reduce the possibility that applied research will run into a psycho-computational bottleneck –
when state-of-the-art computational methods cannot be improved further in the development of user-
transparent computer-human language applications – by incorporating theoretical advances in computational
psycholinguistics into computational language learning technologies.
This workshop brings together a wide range of computational psycholinguistics research that is involved
with the study of language acquisition: 34% of author contributions come from researchers holding positions
in computer science or related departments, 33% from linguistics departments, 30% from psychology or
cognitive science departments, and 3% from other departments.1 The articles present investigations involving
a broad diversity of formalisms, learning strategies, modeling techniques and linguistic phenomena.
Linguistic footings range from (variations on): Universal Grammar, constructionist frameworks, and
categorial grammar, to novel formulations of structural representation, to ‘none.’ Learning strategies include:
distributional and corpus techniques, connectionist implementations, cue-based learning, and hybrid models
that apply several strategies. Phenomena that are modeled include: the acquisition of semantics, linguistic
(principles and) parameter setting, lexical subcategorization, child language production, atypical acquisition,
phonological acquisition and morphological acquisition. Several papers involve cross-linguistic research
and/or use actual child-directed speech (from corpora).

Notably, most papers (not all) address acquisition at the sub-word, word, or multi-word level. Few models
assign structure or meaning to an entire utterance (or discourse) although many papers suggest that a
presented model could be (easily) scaled-up – a worthwhile direction for future research. It is also worth
remarking on the fact that articles addressing formal learning issues (e.g., PAC learning, identification in the
limit, grammar induction, etc.) or that incorporate formalisms from mainstream computational linguistics
(e.g., any of the many variants of probabilistic grammars) are underrepresented (the workshop contains one
such). Future meetings along the lines of this workshop might benefit from attracting research efforts related
to these approaches.
I would sincerely like to thank the program committee for above-and-beyond effort given the tight timetable,
the diversity of the papers, and the several frustrating problems caused by spam-blockers; the workshop
assistants who were a tremendous help with collating the reviews, organizing the articles for the proceedings,
dealing with email and designing the conference web site; and, finally, the members of the COLING-2004
Workshop Program Committee, who were extremely helpful (and patient) on more than one occasion.
