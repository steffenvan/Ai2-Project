Elements of the history, state of the art, and
probable future of Machine Translation (MT) are
discussed. The treatment is largely tutorial,
based on the assumption that this audience is, for
the most part, ignorant of matters pertaining to
translation in general, and MT in particular. The
paper covers some of the major MT R&amp;D groups, the
general techniques they employ(ed), and the roles
they play(ed) in the development of the field. The
conclusions concern the seeming permanence of the
translation problem, and potential re-integration
of MT with mainstream Computational Linguistics.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922402985075">
Machine Translation (MT) of natural human languages
is not a subject about which most scholars feel
neutral. This field has had a long, colorful
career, and boasts no shortage of vociferous
detractors and proponents alike. During its first
decade in the 1950&apos;s, interest and support was
fueled by visions of high-speed high-quality
translation of arbitrary texts (especially those of
interest to the military and intelligence
communities, who funded MT projects quite heavily).
During its second decade in the 1960&apos;s,
disillusionment crept in as the number and
difficulty of the linguistic problems became
increasingly obvious, and as it was realized that
the translation problem was not nearly so amenable
to automated solution as had been thought. The
climax came with the delivery of the National
Academy of Sciences ALPAC report in 1966,
condemning the field and, indirectly, its workers
alike. The ALPAC report was criticized as narrow,
biased, and short-sighted, but its recommendations
were adopted (with the important exception of
increased expenditures for long-term research in
computational linguistics), and as a result MT
projects were cancelled in the U.S. and elsewhere
around the world. By 1973, the early part of the
third decade of MT, only three government-funded
projects were left in the U.S., and by late 1975
there were none. Paradoxically, MT systems were
still being used by various government agencies
here and abroad, because there was simply no
alternative means of gathering information from
foreign [Russian] sources so quickly; in addition,
private companies were developing and selling MT
systems based on the mid-60&apos;s technology so roundly
castigated by ALPAC. Nevertheless the general
disrepute of MT resulted in a remarkably quiet
third decade.
We are now into the fourth decade of MT, and there
is a resurgence of interest throughout the world --
plus a growing number of MT and MAT (Machine-aided
Translation) systems in use by governments,
business and industry. Industrial firms are also
beginning to fund M(A)T R&amp;D projects of their awn;
thus it can no longer be said that only government
funding keeps the field alive (indeed, in the U.S.
there is no government funding, though the Japanese
and European governments are heavily subsidizing MT
R&amp;D). In part this interest is due to more
realistic expectations of what is possible in MT,
and realization that MT can be very useful though
imperfect; but it is also true that the
capabilities of the newer MT systems lie well
beyond what was possible just one decade ago.
In light of these events, it is worth reconsidering
the potential of, and prospects for, Machine
Translation. After opening with an explanation of
how [human] translation is done where it is taken
seriously, we will present a brief introduction to
MT technology and a short historical perspective
before considering the present status and state of
the art, and then moving on to a discussion of the
future prospects. For reasons of space and
perspicuity, we shall concentrate on MT efforts &apos;in
the U.S. and western Europe, though some other MT
projects and less-sophisticated approaches will
receive attention.

The Human Translation Context
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878380952381">
When evaluating the feasibility or desirability of
Machine Translation, one should consider the
endeavor in light of the facts of human translation
for like purposes. In the U.S., it is common to
conceive of translation as simply that which a
human translator does. It is generally believed
that a college degree [or the equivalent] in a
foreign language qualifies one to be a translator
for just about any material whatsoever. Native
speakers of foreign languages are considered to be
that much more qualified. Thus, translation is not
particularly respected as a profession in the U.S.,
and the pay is poor.
In Canada, in Europe, and generally around the
world, this myopic attitude is not held. Where
translation is a fact of life rather than an
oddity, it is realized that any translator&apos;s
competence is sharply restricted to a few domains
(this is especially true of technical areas), and
that native fluency in a foreign language does not
bestow on one the ability to serve as a translator.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996532">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978071428572">
Thus, there are college-level and post-graduate
schools that teach the theory (translatology) as
well as the practice of translation; thus, a
technical translator is trained in the few areas in
which he will be doing translation.
Of special relevance to MT is the fact that
essentially all translations for dissemination
(export) are revised by more highly qualified
translators who necessarily refer back to the
original text when post-editing the translation.
(This is not &amp;quot;pre-publication stylistic editing&amp;quot;.)
Unrevised translations are always regarded as
inferior in quality, or at least suspect, and for
many if not most purposes they are simply not
acceptable. In the multi-national firm Siemens,
even internal communications which are translated
are post-edited. Such news generally comes as a
surprise, if not a shock, to most people in the US.
It is easy to see, therefore, that the
&amp;quot;fully-automatic high-quality machine translation&amp;quot;
standard, imagined by most U.S. scholars to
constitute minimum acceptability, must be radically
redefined. Indeed, the most famous MT critic of
all eventually recanted his strong opposition to
MT, admitting that these terms could only be
defined by the users, according to their own
standards, for each situation [Bar-Hillel, 71]. So
an MT system does not have to print and bind the
result of its translation in order to qualify as
&amp;quot;fully automatic.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;[Ugh quality&amp;quot; does not at all
rule out post-editing, since the proscription of
human revision would &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; the infeasibility of
high-quality Human Translation. Academic debates
about what constitutes &amp;quot;high-quality&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fully-
automatic&amp;quot; are considered irrelevant by the users
of Machine Translation (MT) and Machine-aided
Translation (MAT) systems; what matters to them are
two things: whether the systems can produce output
of sufficient quality for the intended use (e.g.,
revision), and whether the operation as a whole is
cost-effective or, rarely, justifiable on other
grounds, like speed.

Machine Translation Technology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998147">
In order to appreciate the differences among
translation systems (and their applications), it is
necessary to understand, first, the broad
categories into which they can be classified;
second, the different purposes for which
translations (however produced) are used; third,
the intended applications of these systems; and
fourth, something about the linguistic techniques
which MT systems employ in attacking the
translation problem.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.919883">
Categories of Systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999269696969698">
There are three broad categories of &amp;quot;computerized
translation tools&amp;quot; (the differences hinging on how
ambitious the system is intended to be): Machine
Translation (MT), Machine-aided Translation (MAT),
and Terminology Databanks.
MT systems are intended to perform translation
without human intervention. This does not rule out
pre-processing (assuming this is not for the
purpose of marking phrase boundaries and resolving
part-of-speech and/or other ambiguities, etc.), nor
post-editing (since this is normally done for human
translations anyway). However, an MT system is
solely responsible for the complete translation
process from input of the source text to output of
the target text without human assistance, using
special programs, comprehensive dictionaries, and
collections of linguistic rules (to the extent they
exist, varying with the MT system). MT occupies
the top range of positions on the scale of computer
translation sophistication.
MAT systems fall into two subgroups: human-assisted
machine translation (HAMT) and machine-assisted
human translation (MART). These occupy
successively lower ranges on the scale of computer
translation sophistication. HART refers to a
system wherein the computer is responsible for
producing the translation per se, but may interact
with a human monitor at many stages along the way
-- for example, asking the human to disambiguate a
word&apos;s part of speech or meaning, or to indicate
where to attach a phrase, or to choose a
translation for a word or phrase from among several
candidates discovered in the system&apos;s dictionary.
MART refers to a system wherein the human is
responsible for producing the translation per se
(on-line), but may interact with the system in
certain prescribed situations -- for example,
requesting assistance in searching through a local
dictionary/thesaurus, accessing a remote
terminology databank, retrieving examples of the
use of a word or phrase, or performing word
processing functions like formatting. The
existence of a pre-processing stage is unlikely in
a MA(R)T system (the system does not need help,
instead, it is making help available), but
post-editing is frequently appropriate.
Terminology Databanks (TD) are the least
sophisticated systems because access frequently is
not made during a translation task (the translator
may not be working on-line), but usually is
performed prior to human translation. Indeed the
databank may not be accessible (to the translator)
on-line at all, but may be limited to the
production of printed subject-area glossaries. A
TD offers access to technical terminology, but
usually not to common words (the user already knows
these). The chief advantage of a TD is not the
fact that it is automated (even with on-line
access, words can be found just as quickly in a
printed dictionary), but that it is up-to-date:
technical terminology is constantly changing and
published dictionaries are essentially obsolete by
the time they are available. It is also possible
for a TD to contain more entries because it can
draw on a larger group of active contributors: its
users.

The Purposes of Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9902285">
The most immediate division of translation purposes
involves information acquisition vs.
dissemination. The classic example of the former
purpose is intelligence-gathering: with masses of
data to sift through, there is no time, money, or
incentive to carefully translate every document by
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994532">
547
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992590909091">
normal (i.e., human) means. Scientists more
generally are faced with this dilemma: there is
already more to read than can be read in the time
available, and having to labor through texts
written in foreign languages -- when the
probability is low that any given text is of real
interest -- is not worth the effort. In the past,
the lingua franca of science has been English; this
is becoming less and less true for a variety of
reasons, including the rise of nationalism and the
spread of technology around the world. As a
result, scientists who rely on English are having
greater difficulty keeping up with work in their
fields. If a very rapid and inexpensive means of
translation were available, then -- for texts
within the reader&apos;s areas of expertise -- even a
low-quality translation might be sufficient for
information acquisition. At worst, the reader
could determine whether a more careful (and more
expensive) translation effort might be justified.
More likely, he could understand the content of the
text well enough that a more careful translation
would not be necessary.
The classic example of the latter purpose of
translation is technology export: an industry in
one country that desires to sell its products in
another country must usually provide documentation
in the purchaser&apos;s chosen language. In the past,
U.S. companies have escaped this responsibility by
requiring that the purchasers learn English; other
exporters (German, for example) have never had this
luxury. In the future, with the increase of
nationalism, it is less likely that English
documentation will be acceptable. Translation is
becoming increasingly common as more companies look
to foreign markets. More to the point, texts for
information dissemination (export) must be
translated with a great deal of care: the
translation must be &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; as well as clear.
Qualified human technical translators are hard to
find, expensive, and slow (translating somewhere
around 4-6 pages/day, on the average). The
information dissemination application is most
responsible for the renewed interest in MT.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.980812">
Intended Applications of M(A)T
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873206896552">
Although literary translation is a case of
information dissemination, there is little or no
demand for literary translation by machine:
relative to technical translation, there is no
shortage of human translators capable of fulfilling
this need, and in any case computers do not fare
well at literary translation. By contrast, the
demand for technical translation is staggering in
sheer volume; moreover, the acquisition,
maintenance, and consistent use of valid technical
terminology is an enormous problem. Worse, in many
technical fields there is a distinct shortage of
qualified human translators, and it is obvious that
the problem will never be alleviated by measures
such as greater incentives for translators, however
laudable that may be. The only hope for a solution
to the technical translation problem lies with
increased human productivity through computer
technology: full-scale MT, less ambitious MAT,
on-line terminology databanks, and word-processing
all have their place. A serendipitous situation
involves style: in literary translation, emphasis
is placed on style, perhaps at the expense of
absolute fidelity to content (especially for
poetry). In technical translation, emphasis is
properly placed on fidelity, even at the expense of
style. M(A)T systems lack style, but excel at
terminology: they are best suited for technical
translation.

Linguistic Techniques
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999886392857143">
There are several perspectives from which one can
view MT techniques. We will use the following:
direct vs. indirect; interlingua vs. transfer;
and local vs. global scope. (Not all eight
combinations are realized in practice.) We shall
characterize MT systems from these perspectives, in
our discussions. In the past, &amp;quot;the use of
semantics&amp;quot; was always used to distinguish MT
systems; those which used semantics were labelled
&apos;good&apos;, and those which did not were labelled
&apos;bad&apos;. Now all MT systems [are claimed to] make
use of semantics, for obvious reasons, so this is
no longer a distinguishing characteristic.
&amp;quot;Direct translation&amp;quot; is characteristic of a system
(e.g., GAT) designed from the start to translate
out of one specific language and into another.
Direct systems are limited to the minimum work
necessary to effect that translation; for example,
disambiguation is performed only to the extent
necessary for translation into that one target
language, irrespective of what might be required
for another language. &amp;quot;Indirect translation,&amp;quot; on
the other hand, is characteristic of a system
(e.g., EUROTRA) wherein the analysis of the source
language and the synthesis of the target language
are totally independent processes; for example,
disambiguation is performed to the extent necessary
to determine the &apos;meaning&apos; (however represented) of
the source language input, irrespective of which
target language(s) that input might be translated
into.
The &amp;quot;interlingua&amp;quot; approach is characteristic of a
system (e.g., CETA) in which the representation of
the &apos;meaning&apos; of the source language input is
[intended to be] independent of any language, and
this same representation is used to synthesize the
target language output. The &apos;linguistic
universals&apos; searched for and debated about by
linguists and philosophers is the notion that
underlies an interlingua. Thus, the representation
of a given &apos;unit of meaning&apos; would be the same, no
matter what language (or grammatical structure)
that unit might be expressed in. The &amp;quot;transfer&amp;quot;
approach is characteristic of a system (e.g., TAUM)
in which the underlying representation of the
&apos;meaning&apos; of a grammatical unit (e.g., sentence)
differs depending on the language it was derived
from [or into which it is to be generated]; this
implies the existence of a third translation stage
which maps one language-specific meaning
representation into another: this stage is called
Transfer. Thus, the overall transfer translation
process is Analysis followed by Transfer and then
Synthesis. The &amp;quot;transfer&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;interlingua&amp;quot;
difference is not applicable to all systems; in
particular, &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; MT systems use neither the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995424">
548
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99959772">
transfer nor the interlingua approach, since they
do not attempt to represent &apos;meaning&apos;.
&amp;quot;Local scope&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;global scope&amp;quot; is not so much a
difference of category as degree. &amp;quot;Local scope&amp;quot;
characterizes a system (e.g., SYSTRAN) in which
words are the essential unit driving analysis, and
in which that analysis is, in effect, performed by
separate procedures for each word which try to
determine -- based on the words to the left and/or
right -- the part of speech, possible idiomatic
usage, and &apos;sense&apos; of the word keying the
procedure. In such systems, for example,
homographs (words which differ in part of speech
and/or derivational history [thus meaning], but
which are written alike) are a major problem,
because a unified analysis of the sentence per se
is not attempted. &amp;quot;Global scope&amp;quot; characterizes a
system (e.g., METAL) in which the meaning of a word
is determined by its context within a unified
analysis of the sentence (or, rarely, paragraph).
In such systems, by contrast, homographs do not
typically constitute a significant problem because
the amount of context taken into account is much
greater than is the case with systems of &amp;quot;local
scope.&amp;quot;

Historical Perspective
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993277181818182">
There are several comprehensive treatments of MT
projects [Bruderer, 77] and MT history [Hutchins,
781 available in the open literature. To
illustrate some continuity in the field of MT,
while remaining within reasonable space limits, our
brief historical overview will be restricted to
defunct systems/projects which gave rise to
follow-on systems/projects of current interest.
These are: Georgetown&apos;s GAT, Grenoble&apos;s CETA,
Texas&apos; METAL, Montreal&apos;s TAUM, and Brigham Young
University&apos;s ALP system.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.539521">
GAT - Georgetown Automatic Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911647058824">
Georgetown University was the site of one of the
earlIest MT projects. Begun in 1952, and supported
by the U.S. government, Georgetown&apos;s GAT system
became operational in 1964 with its delivery to the
Atomic Energy Commission at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, and to Europe&apos;s corresponding research
facility EURATOM in Ispra, Italy. Both systems
were used for many years to translate Russian
physics texts into &amp;quot;English.&amp;quot; The output quality
was quite poor, by comparison with human
translations, but for the intended purpose of
quickly scanning documents to determine their
content and interest, the GAT system was
nevertheless superior to the only alternatives:
slow and more expensive human translation or,
worse, no translation at all. GAT was not replaced
at EURATOM until 1976; at ORNL, it seems to have
been used until around 1979 [Jordan et al., 76,
77].
The GAT strategy was &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;local&amp;quot;: simple
word-for-word replacement, followed by a limited
amount of transposition of words to result in
something vaguely resembling English. Very soon, a
&apos;word&apos; came to be defined as a single word or a
sequence of words forming an &apos;idiom&apos;. There was no
true linguistic theory underlying the GAT design;
and, given the state of the art in computer
science, there was no underlying computational
theory either. GAT was developed by being made to
work for a given text, then being modified to
account for the next text, and so on. The eventual
result was a monolithic system of intractable
complexity: after its delivery to ORNL and EURATOM,
it underwent no significant modification. The fact
that it was used for so long is nothing short of
remarkable -- a lesson in what can be tolerated by
users who desperately need translation services for
which there is no viable alternative to even
low-quality MT.
The termination of the Georgetown MT project in the
mid-60&apos;s resulted in the incorporation of LATSEC by
Peter Tama, one of the GAT workers. LATSEC soon
developed the SYSTRAN system (based on GAT
technology), which in 1970 replaced the IBM Mark II
system at the USAF Foreign Technology Division
(FTD) at Wright Patterson AFB, and in 1976 replaced
GAT at EURATOM. SYSTRAN is still being used to
translate Russian into English for
information-acquisition purposes. We shall return
to our discussion of SYSTRAN in the next major
section.

CETA - Centre d&apos;Etudes pour la Traduction
Automatique
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996172972973">
In 1961 a project was started at Grenoble
University in France, to translate Russian into
French. Unlike GAT, Grenoble began the CETA
project with a clear linguistic theory -- having
had a number of years in which to witness and learn
from the events transpiring at Georgetown and
elsewhere. In particular, it was resolved to
achieve a dependency-structure analysis of every
sentence (a &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; approach) rather than rely on
intra-sentential heuristics to control limited word
transposition (the &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; approach); with a
unified analysis in hand, a reasonable synthesis
effort could be mounted. The theoretical basis of
CETA was &amp;quot;interlingua&amp;quot; (implying a language-
independent, &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; meaning representation) at
the grammatical level, but &amp;quot;transfer&amp;quot; (implying a
mapping from one language-specific meaning
representation to another) at the lexical
[dictionary] level. The state of the art in
computer science still being primitive, Grenoble
was essentially forced to adopt IBM assembly
language as the software basis of CETA [Hutchins,
78].
The CETA system was under development for ten
years; during 1967-71 it was used to translate
400,000 words of Russian mathematics and physics
texts into French. The major findings of this
period were that the use of an interlingua erases
all clues about how to express the translation;
also, that it results in extremely poor or no
translations of sentences for which complete
analyses cannot be derived. The CETA workers
learned that it is critically important in an
operational system to retain surface clues about
how to formulate the translation (Indo-European
languages, for example, have many structural
similarities, not to mention cognates, that one can

<bodyText confidence="0.999941928571429">
take advantage of), and to have &amp;quot;fail-soft&amp;quot;
measures designed into the system. An interlingua
does not allow this [easily, if at all], but the
transfer approach does.
A change in hardware (thus software) in 1971
prompted the abandonment of the CETA system,
immediately followed by the creation of a new
project/system called GETA, based entirely on a
fail-soft transfer design. The software was still,
however, written in assembly language; this
continued reliance on assembly language was soon to
have deleterious effects, for reasons now obvious
to anyone. We will return to our discussion of
GETA, below.

METAL - MEchanical Translation and Analysis of
Languages
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996028621621622">
Having had the same opportunity for hindsight, the
University of Texas in 1961 used U.S. government
funding to establish the Linguistics Research
Center, and with it the METAL project, to
investigate MT -- not from Russian, but from German
into English. The LAC adopted Chamsky&apos;s
transformational paradigm, which was quickly
gaining popularity in linguistics circles, and
within that framework employed a syntactic
interlingua based on deep structures. It was soon
discovered that transformational linguistics per se
was not sufficiently well-developed to support an
operational system, and certain compromises were
made. The eventual result, in 1974, was an
80,000-line, 14-overlay FORTRAN program running on
a dedicated CDC 6600. Indirect translation was
performed in 14 steps of global analysis, transfer,
and synthesis -- one for each of the 14 overlays --
and required prodigious amounts of CPU time and I/O
from/to massive data files. U.S. government
support for MT projects was winding down in any
case, and the METAL project was shortly terminated.
Several years later, a small Government grant
resurrected the project. The FORTRAN program was
rewritten in LISP to run on a DEC-10; in the
process, it was pared down to just three major
stages (analysis, transfer, and synthesis)
comprising about 4,000 lines of code which could be
accommodated in three &amp;quot;overlays,&amp;quot; and its computer
resource requirements were reduced by a factor of
ten. Though U.S. government interest once again
languished, the Sprachendienst (Language Services)
department of Siemens AG in Munich had begun
supporting the project, and in 1980 Siemens AG
became the sole sponsor.
TAUM - Traduction Automatique de l&apos;Universite de
Montréal
In 1962 the University of Montreal established the
TAUM project with Canadian government funding.
This was probably the first MT project designed
strictly around the transfer approach. As the
software basis of the project, TAUM chose the
PASCAL programming language on the CDC 6600. After
an initial period of more-or-less open-ended
research, the Canadian government began adopting
specific goals for the TAUM system. A chance
remark by a bored translator in the Canadian
Meteorological Center had led to a spin-off
project: TAUM-METEO. Weather forecasters were
already required to adhere to a prescribed manual
of style and vocabulary in their English reports.
Partly as a result of this, translation into French
was so monotonous a task that human translator
turnover in the weather service was extraordinarily
high -- six months was the average tenure. TAUM
was commissioned in 1975 to produce an operational
English-French MT system for weather forecasts. A
prototype was demonstrated in 1976, and by 1977
METE() was installed for production translation. We
will discuss METEO in the next major section.
The next challenge was not long in coming: by a
fixed date, TAUM had to be usable for the
translation of a 90 million word set of aviation
maintenance manuals from English into French (else
the translation had to be started by human means,
since the result was needed quickly). From this
point on, TAUM concentrated on the aviation manuals
exclusively. To alleviate problems with their
purely syntactic analysis (especially considering
the many multiple-noun compounds present in the
aviation manuals), the group began in 1977 to
incorporate partial semantic analysis in the
TAUM-AVIATION system.
After a test in 1979, it became obvious that
TAUM-AVIATION was not going to be production-ready
in time for its intended use. The Canadian
government organized a series of tests and
evaluations to assess the status of the system.
Among other things, it was discovered that the cost
of writing each dictionary entry was remarkably
high (3.75 man-hours, costing $35-40), and that the
system&apos;s runtime translation cost was also high (6
cents/word) considering the cost of human
translation (8 cents/word), especially when the
post-editing costs (10 cents/word for TAUM vs. 4
cents/word for human translations) were taken into
account [Gervais, 1980]; TAUM was not yet
cost-effective. Several other factors, especially
the bad Canadian economic situation, combined with
this to cause the cancellation of the TAUM project
in 1981. There are recent signs of renewed
interest in MT in Canada. State-of-the-art surveys
have been commissioned [Pierre Isabelle, formerly
of TAUM, personal communication], but no successor
project has yet been established.
ALP - Automated Language Processing
In 1971 a project was established at Brigham Young
University to translate Mormon ecclesiastical texts
from English into multiple languages -- starting
with French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. The
eventual aim was to produce a fully-automatic MT
system based on Junction Grammar [Lytle et al.,
75], but actual work proceeded on Machine-Aided
Translation (MAT, where the system does not attempt
to analyze sentences on its own, according to
pre-programmed linguistic rules, but instead relies
heavily on interaction with a human to effect the
analysis [if one is even attempted] and complete
the translation).
The BIU project never produced an operational
system, and the Mormon Church, through the

University, began to dismantle the project. Around
1977, a group composed primarily of programmers
left BYU to join Weidner Communications, Inc., and
proceeded to develop the fully-automatic, direct
Weidner MT system. Shortly thereafter, most of the
remaining BYU project members left to form
Automated Language Processing Systems (ALPS) and
continue development of the BYU MAT system. Both
of these systems are actively marketed today, and
will be discussed in the next section. Some work
continues at BYU, but at a very much reduced level
and degree of aspiration (e.g., [Melby, 82]).

In this section we consider the major M(A)T systems
being used and/or marketed today. Four of these
originate from the &amp;quot;failures&amp;quot; described above, but
four systems are essentially the result of
successful (i.e., continuing) MT R&amp;D projects. The
full MT systems discussed below are the following:
SYSTRAN, LOGOS, METEO, Weidner, and SPANAM; we will
also discuss the MAT systems CULT and ALPS. Most
of these systems have been installed for several
customers (METEO, SPANAM, and CULT are the
exceptions, with only one obvious &amp;quot;user&amp;quot; each).
The oldest installation dates from 1970.
A &amp;quot;standard installation,&amp;quot; if it can be said to
exist, includes provision for pre-processing in
some cases, translation (with much human
intervention in the case of MAT systems), and some
amount of post-editing. To MT system users,
acceptability is a function of the amount of pre-
and/or post-editing that must be done (which is
also the greatest determinant of cost). Van Slype
[82] reports that &amp;quot;acceptability to the human
translator.. .appears negotiable when the quality of
the MT system is such that the correction (i.e.,
post-editing) ratio is lower than 20% (1 correction
every 5 words) and when the human translator can be
associated with the upgrading of the MT system.&amp;quot;
It is worth noting that editing time has been
observed to fall with practice: Pigott [82] reports
that &amp;quot;...the more M.T. output a translator
handles, the more proficient he becomes in making
the best use of this new tool. In some cases he
manages to double his output within a few months as
he begins to recognize typical M.T. errors and
devise more efficient ways of correcting them.&amp;quot;
It is also important to realize that, though none
of these systems produces output mistakable for
human translation [at least not good human
translation], their users have found sufficient
reason to continue using them. Some users, indeed,
are repeat customers. In short, MT &amp; MAT systems
cannot be argued not to work, for they are in fact
being bought and used, and they save time and/or
money for their users. Every user expresses a
desire for improved quality and reduced cost, to be
sure, but then the same is said about human
translation. Thus, in the only valid sense of the
idiom, MT &amp; MAT have already &amp;quot;arrived.&amp;quot; Future
improvements in quality, and reductions in cost --
both certain to take place -- will serve to make
M(A)T systems even more attractive.
SYSTRAN
SYSTRAN was one of the first MT systems to be
marketed; the first installation replaced the IBM
Mark II Russian-English system at the USAF FTD in
1970, and is still operational. Based on the GAT
technology (SYSTRAN uses the same linguistic
strategies, to the extent they can be argued to
exist), SYSTRAN&apos;s software basis has been much
improved by the introduction of modularity
(separating the analysis and synthesis stages), by
a recent shift away from simple &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot;
translation (from the Source Language straight into
the Target Language) toward the inclusion of
something resembling an intermediate &amp;quot;transfer&amp;quot;
stage, and by the allowance of manually-selected
topical glossaries (essentially, dictionaries
specific to [the subject area of] the text). The
system is still ad hoc -- particularly in the
assignment of semantic features [Pigott, 79]. The
USAF FTD dictionaries number over a million
entries; Booted [82] reports that dictionary
updating must be severely constrained, lest a
change to one entry disrupt the activities of many
others. (A study by Wilks [78] reported an
improvement/degradation ratio [after dictionary
updates] of 7:3, but Bostad implies a much more
stable situation after the introduction of
stringent [and expensive] quality-control
measures.) NASA selected SYSTRAN in 1974 to
translate materials relating to the Apollo-Soyuz
collaboration, and EURATOM replaced GAT with
SYSTRAN in 1976. Also by 1976, FTD was augmenting
SYSTRAN with word-processing equipment to increase
productivity (e.g., to eliminate the use of
punch-cards).
In 1976 the Commission of the European Communities
purchased an English-French version of SYSTRAN for
evaluation and potential use. Unlike the FTD,
NASA, and EURATOM installations, where the goal was
information acquisition, the intended use by CEC
was for information dissemination -- meaning that
the output was to be carefully edited before human
consumption. Van Slype [82] reports that &amp;quot;the
English-French standard vocabulary delivered by
Prof. Toma to the Commission was found to be
almost entirely useless for the Commission
environment.&amp;quot; Early evaluations were negative
(e.g., Van Slype [79]), but the existing and
projected overload on CEC human translators was
such that investigation continued in the hope that
dictionary additions would improve the system to
the point of usability. Additional versions of
SYSTRAN were purchased (French-English in 1978, and
English-Italian in 1979). The dream of acceptable
quality for post-editing purposes was eventually
realized: Pigott [82] reports that &amp;quot;...the
enthusiasm demonstrated by [a few translators]
seems to mark something of a turning point in
[machine translation].&amp;quot; Currently, about 20 CEC
translators in Luxembourg are using SYSTRAN on a
Siemens 7740 computer for routine translation; one
factor accounting for success is that the English
and French dictionaries now consist of well over
100,000 entries in the very few technical areas for
which SYSTRAN is being employed.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.987927">

<bodyText confidence="0.999914627906976">
Also in 1976, General Motors of Canada acquired
SYSTRAN for translation of various manuals (for
vehicle service, diesel locomotives, and highway
transit coaches) from English into French on an IBM
mainframe. GM&apos;s English-French dictionary had been
expanded to over 130,000 terms by 1981 [Sereda,
82]. Subsequently, GM purchased an English-Spanish
version of SYSTRAN, and is now working to build the
necessary [very large] dictionary. Sereda [82]
reports a speed-up of 3-4 times in the productivity
of his human translators (from about 1000 words per
day); he also reveals that developing SYSTRAN
dictionary entries costs the company approximately
$4 per term (word- or idiom-pair).
While other SYSTRAN users have applied the system
to unrestricted texts (in selected subject areas),
Xerox has developed a restricted input language
(&apos;Multinational Customized English&apos;) after
consultation with LATSEC. That is, Xerox requires
its English technical writers to adhere to a
specialized vocabulary and a strict manual of
style. SYSTRAN is then employed to translate the
resulting documents into French, Italian, and
Spanish; Xerox hopes to add German and Portuguese.
Ruffino [82] reports &amp;quot;a five-to-one gain in
translation time for most texts&amp;quot; with the range of
gains being 2-10 times. This approach is not
necessarily feasible for all organizations, but
Xerox is willing to employ it and claims it also
enhances source-text clarity.
Currently, SYSTRAN is being used in the CEC for the
routine translation, followed by human
post-editing, of around 1,000 pages of text per
month in the couples English-French,
French-English, and English-Italian [Wheeler, 83].
Given this relative success in the CEC environment,
the Commission has recently ordered an
English-German version as well as a French-German
version. Judging by past experience, it will be
quite some time before these are ready for
production use, but when ready they will probably
save the CEC translation bureau valuable time, if
not real money as well.

LOGOS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993670625">
Development of the LOGOS system was begun in 1964.
The first installation, in 1971, was used by the
U.S. Air Force to translate English maintenance
manuals for military equipment into Vietnamese.
Due to the termination of U.S. involvement in that
war, and perhaps partly to a poor evaluation of
LOGOS cost-effectiveness [Sinaiko and Klare, 73],
its use was ended after two years. As with
SYSTRAN, the linguistic foundations of LOGOS are
weak and inexplicit (they appear to involve
dependency structures); and the analysis and
synthesis rules, though separate, seem to be
designed for particular source and target
languages, limiting their extensibility.
LOGOS continued to attract customers. In 1978,
Siemens AG began funding the development of a LOGOS
German-English system for telecommunications
manuals. After three years LOGOS delivered a
&amp;quot;production&amp;quot; system, but it was not found suitable
for use (due in part to poor quality of the
translations, and in part to the economic situation
within Siemens which had resulted in a much-reduced
demand for translation, hence no immediate need for
an MT system). Eventually LOGOS forged an
agreement with the Wang computer company which
allowed LOGOS to implement the German-English
system (formerly restricted to large IBM
mainframes) on Wang office computers. This system
is being marketed today, and has recently been
purchased by the Commission of the European
Communities. Development of other language pairs
has been mentioned from time to time.

METRO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999858">
TAUM-METEO is the world&apos;s only example of a truly
fully-automatic MT system. Developed as a spin-off
of the TAUM technology, as discussed earlier, it
was fully integrated into the Canadian
Meteorological Center&apos;s (CMC&apos;s) nation-wide weather
communications network by 1977. METE() scans the
network traffic for English weather reports,
translates them &amp;quot;directly&amp;quot; into French, and sends
the translations back out over the communications
network automatically. Rather than relying on
post-editors to discover and correct errors, METEO
detects its own errors and passes the offending
input to human editors; output deemed &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; by
METE() is dispatched without human intervention, or
even overview.
TAUM-METEO was probably also the first MT system
where translators were involved in all phases of
the design/development/refinement; indeed, a CMC
translator instigated the entire project. Since
the restrictions on input to METRO were already in
place before the project started (i.e., METRO
imposed no new restrictions on weather
forecasters), METE() cannot quite be classed with
the TITUS and Xerox SYSTRAN systems which rely .on
restrictions geared to the characteristics of those
MT systems. But MEMO is not extensible.
One of the more remarkable side-effects of the
METE() installation is that the translator turn-over
rate within the CMC went from 6 months, prior to
METRO, to several years, once the CMC translators
began to trust METEO&apos;s operational decisions and
not review its output [Brian Harris, personal
communication]. METEO&apos;s input constitutes over
11,000 words/day, or 3.5 million words/year. Of
this, it correctly translates 807., shuttling the
other (&amp;quot;more interesting&amp;quot;) 20% to the human CMC
translators; almost all of these &amp;quot;analysis
failures&amp;quot; are attributable to violations of the CMC
language restrictions, though some are due to the
inability of the system to handle certain
constructions. METEO&apos;s computational requirements
total about 15 CPU minutes per day on a CDC 7600
[Thouin, 82]. By 1981, it appeared that the
built-in limitations of METEO&apos;s theoretical basis
had been reached, and further improvement was not
possible.

Weidner Communications Systems, Inc.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983">
Weidner was established in 1977 by Bruce Weidner,
who hired a group of MT workers (predominantly
programmers) from the fading BYU project. Weidner
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999872329113925">
delivered a production English-French system to
Mitel in Canada in 1980, and a beta-test
English-Spanish system to the Siemens Corporation
(USA) in the same year. In 1981 Mitel took
delivery on Weidner&apos;s English-Spanish and
English-German systems, and Bravice (a translation
service bureau in Japan) purchased the Weidner
English-Spanish and Spanish-English systems. To
date, there are about 22 installations of the
Weidner MT system around the world. The Weidner
system, though &amp;quot;fully automatic&amp;quot; during
translation, is marketed as a &apos;machine aid to
translation (perhaps to avoid the stigma usually
attached to MT). It is highly interactive for
other purposes (the lexical pre-analysis of texts,
the construction of dictionaries, etc.), and
integrates word-processing software with external
devices (e.g., the Xerox 9700 laser printer at
Mitel) for enhanced overall document production.
Thus, the Weidner system accepts a formatted source
document (actually, one containing
formatting/typesetting codes) and produces a
formatted translation. This is an important
feature to users, since almost everyone is
interested in producing formatted translations from
formatted source texts.
Given the way this system is tightly integrated
with modern word-processing technology, it is
difficult to assess the degree to which the
translation component itself enhances translator
productivity, vs. the degree to which simple
automation of formerly manual (or poorly automated)
processes accounts for the productivity gains. The
&amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; translation component itself is not
particularly sophisticated. For example analysis
is &amp;quot;local,&amp;quot; being restricted to the noun phrase or
verb phrase level -- so that context available only
at higher levels can never be taken into account.
Translation is performed in four independent
stages: idiom search, homograph disambiguation,
structural analysis, and transfer. These stages do
not interact with each other, which creates more
problems; for example, an apparent idiom in a text
is always treated idiomatically -- never literally,
no matter what its context (since no other
contextual information is available until later).
Mundt [82] comments that &amp;quot;idioms are an extremely
important part of the translation procedure.&amp;quot; It
is particularly interesting that he continues:
&amp;quot;...machine assisted translation is for the most
part word replacement...&amp;quot; Then, &amp;quot;It is not
worthwhile discussing the various problems of the
[Weidner] system in great depth because in the
first place they are much too numerous...&amp;quot; Yet
even though the Weidner translations are of low
quality, users nevertheless report economic
satisfaction with the results. Mundt continues
the Weidner system indeed works as an aid...&amp;quot;
and, &amp;quot;800 words an hour as a final figure [for
translation throughput] is not unrealistic.&amp;quot; This
level of performance was not attainable with
previous [human] methods, and some users report the
use of Weidner to be cost-effective, as well as
faster, in their environments.
In 1982, Weidner delivered English-German and
German-English systems to ITT in Great Britain; but
there were some financial problems (a third of the
employees were laid off that year) until a
controlling interest was purchased by a Japanese
company: Bravice, one of Weidner&apos;s customers, owned
by a group of wealthy Japanese investors. Weidner
continues to market MT systems, and is presently
working to develop Japanese MT systems. A
prototype Japanese-English system has recently been
installed at Bravice, and work continues on an
English-Japanese system. In addition, Weidner has
implemented its system on the IBM Personal
Computer, in order to reduce its former dependence
on the PDP-11.

SPANAM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99950196">
Following a promising feasiblity study, the Pan
American Health Organization in Washington, D.C.
decided in 1975 to undertake work on a machine
translation system, utilizing many of the same
techniques developed for GAT; consultants were
hired from nearby Georgetown University, the home
of GAT. The official PAHO languages are English,
French, Portuguese, and Spanish; Spanish-English
was chosen as the initial language pair, due to the
belief that &amp;quot;This combination requires fewer
parsing strategies in order to produce manageable
output [and other reasons relating to expending
effort on software rather than linguistic rules]&amp;quot;
[Vasconcellos, 83]. Actual work started in 1976,
and the first prototype was running in 1979, using
punched card input on an IBM mainframe. With the
subsequent integration of a word processing system,
production use could be seriously considered.
After further upgrading, the system in 1980 was
offerred as a service to potential users. Later
that year, in its first major test, SPANAM reduced
manpower requirements for a certain translation
effort by 45%, resulting in a monetary savings of
61% [Vasconcellos, 83]. Since then it has been
used to translate well over a million words of
text, averaging about 4,000 words per day per
post-editor. (Significantly, SPANAM&apos;s in-house
developers seem to be the only revisors of its
output.) The post-editors have amassed &amp;quot;a bag of
tricks&amp;quot; for speeding the revision work, and special
string functions have also been built into the word
processor for handling SPANAM&apos;s English output.
Sketchy details imply that the linguistic
technology underlying SPANAM is essentially that of
GAT; the rules may even still be built into the
programs. The software technology has been updated
considerably in that the programs are modular (in
the newest version). The total lack of
sophistication by modern Computational Linguistics
standards is evidenced by the offhand remark that
&amp;quot;The maximum length of an idiom [allowed in the
dictionary] was increased from five words to
twenty-five&amp;quot; in 1980 [Vasconcellos, 83]. Also, the
system adopts the &amp;quot;direct&amp;quot; translation strategy,
and fails to attempt a &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; analysis of the
sentence, settling for &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; analysis of limited
phrases. The SPANAM dictionary currently numbers
55,000 entries. A follow-on project to develop
ENGSPAN, underway since 1981, has produced some
test translations.

CULT - Chinese University Language Translator
CULT is perhaps the most successful of the
Machine-aided Translation systems. Development
began at the Chinese University of Hong Kong around
1968. CULT translates Chinese mathematics and
physics journals (published in Beijing) into
English through a highly-interactive process [or,
at least, with a lot of human intervention]. The
goal was to eliminate post-editing of the results
by allowing a large amount of pre-editing of the
input, and a certain [unknown] degree of human
intervention during translation. Although
published details [Loh, 76, 78, 79] are not
unambiguous, it is clear that humans intervene by
marking sentence and phrase boundaries in the
input, and by indicating word senses where
necessary, among other things. (What is not clear
is whether this is strictly a pre-editing task, or
an interactive task.) CULT runs on the ICL 1904A
computer.
Beginning in 1975, the CULT system was applied to
the task of translating the Acta Mathematica Sinica
into English; in 1976, this was joined by the Acta
Physica Sinica. This production translation
practice continues to this day. Originally the
Chinese character transcription problem was solved
by use of the standard telegraph codes invented a
century ago, and the input data was punched on
cards. But in 1978 the system was updated by the
addition of word-processing equipment for on-line
data entry and pre/post-editing.
It is not clear how general the techniques behind
CULT are -- whether, for example, it could be
applied to the translation of other texts -- nor
how cost-effective it is in operation. Other
factors may justify its continued use. It is also
unclear whether R&amp;D is continuing, or whether CULT,
like METEO, is unsuited to design modification
beyond a certain point already reached. In the
absence of answers to these questions, and perhaps
despite them, CULT does appear to be an MAT success
story: the amount of post-editing said to be
required is trivial -- limited to the
re-introduction of certain untranslatable formulas,
figures, etc., into the translated output. At some
point, other translator intervention is required,
but it seems to be limited to the manual inflection
of verbs and nouns for tense and number, and
perhaps the introduction of a few function words
such as English determiners.
ALPS - Automated Language Processing Systems
ALPS was incorporated by another group of Brigham
Young University workers, around 1979; while the
group forming Weidner was composed mostly of the
programmers interested in producing a
fully-automatic MT system, the group forming ALPS
(reusing the old BTU acronym) was composed mostly
of linguists interested in producing machine aids
for human translators (dictionary look-up and
substitution, etc.) [Melby and Tenney, personal
communication]. Thus the ALPS system is
interactive in all respects, and does not seriously
pretend to perform translation at all; rather, ALPS
provides the translator with a set of software
tools to automate many of the tasks encountered in
everyday translation experience. ALPS adopted the
tools originally developed at BYU -- and hence, the
language pairs the BYU system had supported:
English into French, German, Portuguese, and
Spanish. Since then, other languages (e.g.,
Arabic) have been announced, but their commercial
status is unclear.
The ALPS system is intended to work on any of three
&amp;quot;levels&amp;quot; -- providing capabilities from simple
dictionary lookup on demand to word-for-word
(actually, term-for-term) translation and
substitution into the target text. The central
tool provided by ALPS is a menu-driven
word-processing system coupled to the on-line
dictionary. One of the first ALPS customers seems
to have been Agnew TechTran -- a commercial
translation bureau which acquired the ALPS system
for in-house use. Recently, another change of
ownership and consequent shake-up at Weidner
communication Systems, Inc., has allowed ALPS to
hire a large group of former Weidner workers,
leading to speculation that ALPS might itself be
intending to enter the MT arena.

MT R&amp;D in Japan
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863269230769">
In 1982 Japan electrified the technological world
by widely publicizing their new Fifth Generation
project and establishing the Institute for New
Generation Computer Technology (ICOT) as its base.
Its goal is to leapfrog Western technology and
place Japan at the forefront of the digital
electronics world in the 1990&apos;s. MITI (Japan&apos;s
Ministry of International Trade and Industry) is
the motivating force behind this project, and
intends that the goal be achieved through the
development and application of highly innovative
techniques in both computer architecture and
Artificial Intelligence.
Of the research areas to be addressed by the ICOT
scientists and engineers, Machine Translation plays
a prominent role. Among the western Artificial
Intelligentsia, the inclusion of NT seems out of
place: Al researchers have been trying
(successfully) to ignore all MT work in the two
decades since the ALPAC debacle, and almost
universally believe that success is impossible in
the foreseeable future -- in ignorance of the
successful, cost-effective applications already in
place. To the Japanese leadership, however, the
inclusion of MT is no accident. Foreign language
training aside, translation into Japanese is still
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996821">
554
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984196875">
one of the primary means by which Japanese
researchers acquire information about what their
Western competitors are doing, and how they are
doing it. Translation out of Japanese is necessary
before Japan can export products to its foreign
markets, because the customers demand that the
manuals and other documentation not be written only
in Japanese. The Japanese correctly view
translation as necessary to their technological
survival, but have found it extremely difficult to
accomplish by human means. Accordingly, their
government has sponsored MT research for several
decades. There has been no rift between Al and MT
researchers in Japan, as there has been in the West
-- especially in the U.S. MT may even be seen as
the key to Japan&apos;s acquisition of enough Western
technology to train their scientists and engineers,
and thus accomplish their Fifth Generation project
goals.
Nomura [82] numbers the MT R&amp;D groups in Japan at
more than eighteen. (By contrast, there might be a
dozen significant MT groups in all of the U.S. and
Europe, including commercial vendors.) Several of
the Japanese projects are quite large. (By
contrast, only one MT project in the western world
[EUROTRA] even appears as large, but most of the 80
individuals involved work on EUROTRA only a
fraction of their time.) Most of the Japanese
projects are engaged in research as much as
development. (Most Western projects are engaged in
development.) Japanese progress in MT has not came
fast: until a few years ago, their hardware
technology was inferior; so was their software
competence, but this situation has been changing
rapidly. Another obstacle has been the great
differences between Japanese and Western languages
especially English, which is of greatest
interest to them -- and the relative paucity of
knowledge about these differences. The Japanese
are working to eliminate this ignorance: progress
has been made, and production-quality systems
already exist for some applications. None of the
Japanese MT systems are &amp;quot;direct,&amp;quot; and all engage in
&amp;quot;global&amp;quot; analysis; most are based on a transfer
approach, but a few groups are pursuing the
interlingua approach.
MT research has been pursued at Kyoto University
since 1968. There are now two MT projects at Kyoto
(one for near-term application, one for long-term
research). The former has developed a practical
system for translating English titles of scientific
and technical papers into Japanese [Nagao, 80, 82],
and is working on other applications of
English-Japanese [Tsujii, 82] as well as
Japanese-English [Nagao, 81]. The other group at
Kyoto is working on an English-Japanese translation
system based on formal semantics (Cresswell&apos;s
simplified version of Montague Grammar [Nishida et
al., 82, 831). Kyushu University has been the home
of MT research since 1955, with projects by Tamachi
and Shudo [74]. The University of Osaka Prefecture
and Fukuoka University also host MT projects.
However, most Japanese MT research (like other
research) is performed in the industrial
laboratories. Fujitsu [Sawai et al., 82], Hitachi,
Toshiba [Amano, 82], and NEC [Muraki &amp; Ichiyama,
82], among others, support large projects generally
concentrating on the translation of computer
manuals. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone is working
on a system to translate scientific and technical
articles from Japanese into English and vice versa
[Nomura et al., 82], and is looking into the future
as far as simultaneous machine translation of
telephone conversations [Nomura, personal
communication].
The Japanese industrialists are not confining their
attention to work at home. Several AI/MT groups in
the U.S. (e.g., SRI, U. Texas) have been
approached by Japanese companies desiring to fund
MT R&amp;D projects. More than that, some U.S. MT
vendors (SYSTRAN and Weidner, at least) have
recently sold partial interests to Japanese
investors. Various Japanese corporations (e.g.,
NTT and Hitachi) and trade groups (e.g., JEIDA
[Japan Electronic Industry Development
Association]) have sent teams to visit MT projects
around the world and assess the state of the art.
University researchers have been given sabbaticals
to work at Western MT centers (e.g., Shudo at
Texas, Tsujii at Grenoble). Other representatives
have indicated Japan&apos;s desire to participate in the
GEC&apos;s EUROTRA project [Margaret King, personal
communication]. Japan evidences a long-term,
growing commitment to acquire and develop MT
technology. The Japanese leadership is convinced
that success in MT is vital to their future.

METAL

<bodyText confidence="0.999963606060606">
Of the major MT R&amp;D groups around the world, it
would appear that the new METAL project at the
Linguistics Research Center of the University of
Texas is closest to delivering a product. The
METAL German-English system passed tests in a
production-style setting in late 1982, mid-83, and
early 1984, and the system has been installed at
the sponsor&apos;s site in Germany for further testing
and final development of a translator interface.
The METAL dictionaries are being expanded for
maximum possible coverage of selected technical
areas in anticipation of production use in 1984.
Commercial introduction is also a possibility.
Work on other language pairs has begun:
English-German is now underway, and Spanish and
Chinese are in the target language design stage.
One of the particular strengths of the METAL system
is its accommodation of a variety of linguistic
theories/strategies. The German analysis component
is based on a context-free phrase-structure
grammar, augmented by procedures with facilities
for, among other things, arbitrary transformations.
The English analysis component, on the other hand,
employs a modified GPSG approach and makes no use
of transformations. Analysis is completely
separated from transfer, and the system is
multi-lingual in that a given constituent structure
analysis can be used for transfer and synthesis
into multiple target languages. Experimental
translation of English into Chinese (in addition to
German) will soon be underway; translation from
both English and German into Spanish is expected to
begin in the immediate future.

The transfer component of METAL includes two
transformation packages, one used by transfer
grammar rules and the other by transfer dictionary
entries; these co—operate during transfer, which is
effected during a top—dawn exploration of the
[highest—scoring] tree produced in the analysis
phase. The strategy for the top—down pass is
controlled by the linguist who writes the transfer
rules; these in turn are paired 1-1 with the
grammar rules used to perform the original
analysis, so that there is no need to search
through a general transfer grammar to find
applicable rules (potentially allowing application
of the wrong ones). As implied above, structural
and lexical transfer are performed in the same
pass, so that each may influence the operation of
the other; in particular, transfer dictionary
entries may specify the syntactic and/or semantic
contexts in which they are valid. If no analysis
is achieved for a given input, the longest phrases
which together span that input are selected for
independent transfer and synthesis, so that every
input (a sentence, or perhaps a phrase) results in
some translation.
In addition to producing a translation system per
se, the Texas group has developed software packages
for text processing (so as to format the output
translations like the original input documents),
data base management (of dictionary entries and
grammar rules), rule validation (to eliminate most
errors in dictionary entries and grammar rules),
dictionary construction (to enhance human
efficiency in coding lexical entries), etc. Aside
from the word—processing front—end (being developed
by Siemens, the project sponsor), the METAL group
is developing a complete system, rather than a
basic machine translation engine that leaves much
drudgery for its human developers/users. Lehmann
et al. [81], Bennett [82], and Slocum [83, 84]
present more details about the METAL system.

GETA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911942528736">
As discussed earlier, the Groupe d&apos;ttudes pour la
Traduction Autamatique was formed when Grenoble
abandoned the CETA system. In reaction to the
failures of the interlingua approach, GETA adopted
the transfer approach. In addition, the former
software design was largely discarded, and a new
software package supporting a new style of
processing was substituted. The core of GETA is
composed of three programs: one converts strings
into trees (for, e.g.) word analysis), one converts
trees into trees (for, e.g., syntactic analysis and
transfer), and the third converts trees into
strings (for, e.g., word synthesis). The overall
translation process is composed of a sequence of
stages, wherein each stage employs one of these
three programs.
One of the features of GETA that sets it apart from
other MT systems is the insistence on the part of
the designers that no stage be more powerful than
is minimally necessary for its proper function.
Thus, rather than supplying the linguist with
programming tools capable of performing any
operation whatever (e.g., the arbitrarily powerful
Q—systems of TAUM), GETA supplies at each stage
only the minimum capability necessary to effect the
desired linguistic operation, and no more. This
reduces the likelihood that the linguist will
became overly ambitious and create unnecessary
problems, and also enabled the programmers to
produce software that runs more rapidly than would
be possible with a more general scheme.
A &amp;quot;grammar&amp;quot; in GETA is actually a network of
subgrammars; that is, a grammar is a graph
specifying alternative sequences of applications of
the subgrammars and optional choices of which
subgrammars are to be applied (at all). The
top—level grammar is therefore a &amp;quot;control graph&amp;quot;
over the subgrammars which actually effect the
linguistic operations -- analysis, transfer, etc.
GETA is sufficiently general to allow
implementation of any linguistic theory, or even
multiple theories at once (in separate subgrammars)
if such is desired. Thus, in principle, GETA is
completely open—ended and could accommodate
arbitrary semantic processing and reference to
&apos;world models&apos; of any description.
In practice, however, the story is more
complicated. In order to increase the
computational flexibility, as is required to take
advantage of substantially new linguistic theories,
especially &apos;world models&apos;, the underlying software
would have to be changed in many various ways.
Unfortunately, it is written in IBM assembly
language, making modification extremely difficult.
Worse, the programmers who wrote the software have
long since left the GETA project, and the current
staff is unable to safely attempt significant
modification. As a result, there has been no
substantive change to the GETA software since 1975,
and the GETA group has been unable to experiment
with any new computational strategies. Back—up,
for example, is a known problem [Tsujii, personal
communication]: if the GETA system &amp;quot;pursues a wrong
path&amp;quot; through the control graph of subgrammars, it
can undo some of its work by backing up past whole
graphs, discarding the results produced by entire
subgrammars; but within a subgrammar, there is no
possibility of backing up and reversing the effects
of individual rule applications. The GETA workers
would like to experiment with such a facility, but
are unable to change the software to allow this.
Until GETA receives enough funding that new
programmers can be hired to rewrite the software in
a high—level language, facilitating present and
future redesign, the GETA group is &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; with the
current software, now 10 years old and showing
clear signs of age, to say nothing of
non—transportability.
GETA seems not to have been pressed to produce an
application early on, and the staff was relatively
&amp;quot;free&amp;quot; to pursue research interests. Until GETA
can be updated, and in the process freed from
dependence on IBM mainframes, it may never be a
viable system. The project staff are actively
seeking funding for such a project. Meanwhile, the
French government has launched an application
effort through the GETA group.

SUSY - Saarbruecker Uebersetzungssystem
The University of the Saar at Saarbruecken, West
Germany, hosts one of the larger MT projects in
Europe, established in the late 1960&apos;s. After the
failure of a project intended to modify GAT for
Russian-German translation, a new system was
designed along somewhat similar lines to translate
Russian into German after &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; sentence
analysis into dependency tree structures, using the
transfer approach. Unlike most other MT projects,
the Saarbruecken group was left relatively free to
pursue research interests, rather than forced to
produce applications, and was also funded at a
level sufficient to permit significant on-going
experimentation and modification. As a result,
SUSY tended to track external developments in MT
and Al more closely than other projects. For
example, Saarbruecken helped establish the
co-operative MT group LEIBNIZ (along with Grenoble
and others) in 1974, and adopted design ideas from
the GETA system. Until 1975, SUSY was based on a
strict transfer approach; since 1976, however, it
has evolved, becoming more abstract as linguistic
problems mandating &amp;quot;deeper&amp;quot; analysis have forced
the transfer representations to assume some of the
generality of an interlingua. Also as a result of
such research freedom, there was apparently no
sustained attempt to develop coverage for specific
applications.
Intended as a multi-lingual system involving
English, French, German and Russian, work on SUSY
has concentrated on translation into German from
Russian and, recently, English. Thus, the extent
to which SUSY may be capable of multilingual
translation has not yet been ascertained. Then,
too, some aspects of the software are surprisingly
primitive: only very recently, for example, did the
morphological analysis program became
nondeterministic (i.e., general enough to permit
lexical ambiguity). The strongest limiting factor
in the further development of SUSY seems to be
related to the initial inspiration behind the
project: SUSY adopted a primitive approach in which
the linguistic rules were organized into
independent strata, and were incorporated directly
into the software [Maas, 84]. As a consequence,
the rules were virtually unreadable, and their
interactions, eventually, became almost impossible
to manage. In terms of application potential,
therefore, SUSY seems to have failed. A
second-generation project, SUSY-II, begun in 1981,
may fare better.
EUROTRA
EUROTRA is the largest MT project in the Western
world. It is the first serious attempt to produce
a true multi-lingual system, in this case intended
for all seven European Economic Community
languages. The justification for the project is
simple, inescapable economics: over a third of the
entire administrative budget of the EEC for 1982
was needed to pay the translation division (average
individual income: $43,000/year), which still could
not keep up with the demands placed on it;
technicai translation costs the EEC $.20 per word
for each of six translations (from the seventh
original language), and doubles the cost of the
technology documented; with the addition of Spain
and Portugal later this decade, the translation
staff would have to double for the current demand
level (unless highly productive machine aids were
already in place) [Perusse, 83]. The high cost of
writing SYSTRAN dictionary entries is presently
justifiable for reasons of speed in translation,
but this situation is not viable in the long term.
The EEC must have superior quality MT at lower cost
for dictionary work. Human translation alone will
never suffice.
EUROTRA is a true multi-national development
project. There is no central laboratory where the
work will take place, but instead designated
University representatives of each member country
will produce the analysis and synthesis modules for
their native language; only the transfer modules
will be built by a &amp;quot;central&amp;quot; group -- and the
transfer modules are designed to be as small as
possible, consisting of little more than lexical
substitution [Ring, 82]. Software development will
be almost entirely separated from the linguistic
rule development; indeed, the production software,
though designed by the EUROTRA members, will be
written by whichever commercial software house wins
the contract in bidding competition. Several
co-ordinating committees are working with the
various language and emphasis groups to insure
co-operation.
The linguistic basis of EUROTRA is nothing novel.
The basic structures for representating &apos;meaning&apos;
are dependency trees, marked with feature-value
pairs partly at the discretion of the language
groups writing the grammars (anything a group
wants, it can add), and partly controlled by mutual
agreement among the language groups (a certain set
of feature-value combinations has been agreed to
constitute minimum information; all are constrained
to produce this set when analyzing sentences in
their language, and all may expect it to be present
when synthesizing sentences in their language)
[King, 81, 821.
The software basis of EUROTRA will not be navel
either, though the design is not yet complete. The
basic rule interpreter will be &amp;quot;a general re-write
system with a control language over
grammars/processes&amp;quot; [King, personal communication].
As in GETA, the linguistic rules will be bundled
into packets of subgrammars, and the linguists will
be provided with a means of controlling which
packets of rules are applied, and when; the
individual rules will be non-destructive re-write
rules, so that the application of any given rule
may create new structure, but will never erase any
old information (no back-up).
EUROTRA will engage in straightforward development
using state-of-the-art but &amp;quot;proven&amp;quot; techniques.
The charter requires delivery of a small
representative prototype system by late 1987, and a
prototype covering one technical area by late 1988.
EUROTRA is required to translate among the native
languages of all member countries which sign the
&amp;quot;contract of association&amp;quot; by early mid-84; thus,
not all seven EEC languages will necessarily be

<bodyText confidence="0.995795571428572">
represented, but by law at least four languages
must be represented if the project is to continue.
The State of the Art
Human languages are, by nature, different. So much
so, that the illusory goal of abstract perfection
in translation -- once and still imagined by some
to be achievable -- can be comfortably ruled out of
the realm of possible existence, whether attempted
by machine or man. Even the abstract notion of
&amp;quot;quality&amp;quot; is undefinable, hence immeasurable. In
its place, we must substitute the notion of
evaluation of translation according to its purpose,
judged by the consumer. One must therefore accept
the truth that the notion of quality is inherently
subjective. Certainly there will be translations
hailed by most if not all as &amp;quot;good,&amp;quot; and
correspondingly there will be translations almost
universally labelled &amp;quot;bad.&amp;quot; Most translations,
however, will surely fall in between these
extremes, and each user must render his own
judgement according to his needs.
In corporate circles, however, there is and has
always been an operational definition of &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; vs.
&amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; translation: a good translation is what
senior translators are willing to expose to outside
scrutiny (not that they are fully satisfied, for
they never are); and a bad one is what they are not
willing to release. These experienced translators
-- usually post—editors -- impose a judgement which
the corporate body is willing to accept at face
value: after all, such judgement is the very
purpose for having senior translators. It is
arrived at subjectively, based on the purpose for
which the translation is intended, but comes as
close to being an objective assessment as the world
is likely to see. In a post—editing context, a
&amp;quot;good&amp;quot; original translation is one worth revising
-- i.e., one which the editor will endeavor to
change, rather than reject or replace with his awn
original translation.
Therefore, any rational position on the state of
the art in MT &amp; MAT must respect the operational
decisions about the quality of MT &amp; MAT as judged
by the present users. These systems are all, of
course, based on old technology (&amp;quot;ancient,&amp;quot; by the
standards of Al researchers); but by the time
systems employing today&apos;s Al technology hit the
market, they too will be &amp;quot;antiquated&amp;quot; by the
research laboratory standards of their time. Such
is the nature of technology. We will therefore
distinguish, in our assessment, between what is
available and/or used now (&amp;quot;old,&amp;quot; yet operationally
current, technology), and what is around the next
corner (techniques working in research labs today),
and what is farther down the road (experimental
approaches).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.848846">
Production Systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958024390244">
Production M(A)T systems are based on old
technology; some, for example, still (or until very
recently did) employ punch—cards and print(ed) out
translations in all upper—case. Few if any attempt
a comprehensive &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; analysis at the sentence
level (trade secrets make this hard to discern),
and none go beyond that to the paragraph level.
None use a significant amount of semantic
information (though all claim to use some). Most
if not all perform as &apos;idiots savants&apos;, making use
of enormous amounts of very unsophisticated
pragmatic information and brute—force computation
to determine the proper word—for—word or
idiom—for—idiom translation followed by local
rearrangement of word order -- leaving the
translation chaotic, even if understandable.
But they work! Some of them do, anyway -- well
enough that their customers find reason to invest
enormous amounts of time and capital developing the
necessary massive dictionaries specialized to their
applications. Translation time is certainly
reduced. Translator frustration is increased or
decreased, as the case may be (it seems that
personality differences, among other things, have a
large bearing on this). Some translators resist
their introduction -- there are those who still
resist the introduction of typewriters, to say
nothing of word processors -- with varying degrees
of success. But most are thinking about accepting
the place of computers in translation, and a few
actually look forward to relief from much of the
drudgery they now face. Current MT systems seem to
take some getting used to, and further productivity
increases are realized as time goes by; they are
usually accepted, eventually, as a boon to the
bored translator. New products embodying old
technology are constantly introduced; most are
found not viable, and quickly disappear from the
market. But those which have been around for years
must be economically justifiable to their users --
else, presumably, they would no longer exist.

Development Systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921448275862">
Systems being developed for near—term introduction
employ Computational Linguistics (CL) techniques of
the late 1970&apos;s, if not the 80&apos;s. Essentially all
are full MT, not MAT, systems. As Hutchins [82]
notes, &amp;quot;...there is now considerable agreement on
the basic strategy, i.e. a &apos;transfer&apos; system with
some semantic analysis and some interlingual
features in order to simplify transfer components.&amp;quot;
These systems employ one of a variety of
sophisticated parsing/transducing techniques,
typically based on charts, whether the grammar is
expressed via phrase—structure rules (e.g., METAL)
or [strings of] trees (e.g., GETA, EUROTRA); they
operate at the sentence level, or higher, and make
significant use of semantic features. Proper
linguistic theories, whether elegant or not quite,
and heuristic software strategies take the place of
simple word substitution and brute—force
programming. If the analysis attempt succeeds, the
translation stands a fair chance of being
acceptable to the revisor; if analysis fails, then
fail—soft measures are likely to produce something
equivalent to the output of a current production MT
system.
These systems work well enough in experimental
settings to give their sponsors and waiting
customers (to say nothing of their implementors)
reason to hope for near—term success in
application. Their technology is based on some of
</bodyText>

558
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997523217391304">
the latest techniques which appear to be workable
in immediate large-scale application. Most &amp;quot;pure
Al&amp;quot; techniques do not fall in this category; thus,
serious Al researchers look down on these
development systems (to say nothing of production
systems) as old, uninteresting -- and probably
useless. Some likely are. But others, though
&amp;quot;old,&amp;quot; will soon find an application niche, and
will begin displacing any of the current production
systems which try to compete. (Since the present
crop of development systems all seem to be aimed at
the &amp;quot;information dissemination&amp;quot; application, the
current production systems that are aimed at the
&amp;quot;information acquisition&amp;quot; market may survive for
some time.) The major hurdle is time: time to
write and debug the grammars (a very hard task),
and time to develop lexicons with roughly ten
thousand general vocabulary items, and the few tens
of thousands of technical terms required per
subject area. Some development projects have
invested the necessary time, and stand ready to
deliver commercial applications (e.g., GETA,
METAL).

Research Systems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970521739131">
The biggest problem associated with MT research
systems is their scarcity (nonexistence, in the
U.S.). If current CL and Al researchers were
seriously interested in multiple languages -- even
if not for translation per se -- this would not
necessarily be a bad situation. But in the U.S.
they certainly are not, and in Europe, CL and Al
research has not yet reached the level achieved in
the U.S. Western business and industry are
naturally more concerned with near-term payoff, and
some track development systems; very few support MT
development directly, and none yet support pure MT
research at a significant level. (The Dutch firm
Philips may, indeed, have the only long-term
research project in the West.) Some European
governments fund significant R&amp;D projects (e.g.,
Germany and France), but Japan is making by far the
world&apos;s largest investment in MT research. The
U.S. government, which otherwise supports the best
overall Al and [English] CL research in the world,
is not involved.
Where pure MT research projects do exist, they tend
to concentrate on the problems of deep meaning
representations -- striving to pursue the goal of a
true Al system, which would presumably include
language-independent meaning representations of
great depth and complexity. Translation here is
seen as just one application of such a system: the
system &amp;quot;understands&amp;quot; natural language input, then
&amp;quot;generates&amp;quot; natural language output; if the
languages happen to be different, then translation
has been performed via paraphrase. Translation
could thus be viewed as one of the ultimate tests
of an Artificial Intelligence: if a system
&amp;quot;translates correctly,&amp;quot; then to some extent it can
be argued to have &amp;quot;understood correctly,&amp;quot; and in
any case will tell us much about what translation
is all about. In this role, MT research holds out
its greatest promise as a once-again scientifically
respectable discipline. The first requirement,
however, is the existence of research groups
interested in, and funded for, the study of
multiple languages and translation among them
within the framework of Al research. At the
present time only Japan, and to a somewhat lesser
extent western Europe, can boast such groups.

Future Prospects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985009375">
The world has changed in the two decades since
ALPAC. The need and demand for technical
translation has increased dramatically, and the
supply of qualified human technical translators has
not kept pace. (Indeed, it is debatable whether
there existed a sufficient supply of qualified
technical translators even in 1966, contrary to
ALPAC&apos;s claims.) The classic &amp;quot;law of supply and
demand&amp;quot; has not worked in this instance, for
whatever reasons: the shortage is real, all over
the world; nothing is yet serving to stem this
worsening situation; and nothing seems capable of
doing so outside of dramatic productivity increases
via computer automation. In the EEC, for example,
the already overwhelming load of technical
translation is projected to rise sixfold within
five years.
The future promises greater acceptance by
translators of the role of machine aids -- running
the gamut from word processing systems and on-line
term banks to MT systems -- in technical
translation. Correspondingly, M(A)T systems will
experience greater success in the marketplace. As
these systems continue to drive down the cost of
translation, the demand and capacity for
translation will grow even more than it would
otherwise: many &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; needs for translation, not
presently economically justifiable, will surface.
If MT systems are to continue to improve so as to
further reduce the burden on human translators,
there will be a greater need and demand for
continuing MT R&amp;D efforts.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.696253" genericHeader="conclusions">
Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99900496">
The translation problem will not go away, and human
solutions (short of full automation) do not now,
and never will, suffice. MT systems have already
scored successes among the user community, and the
trend can hardly fail to continue as users demand
further improvements and greater speed, and MT
system vendors respond. Of course, the need for
research is great, but some current and future
applications will continue to succeed on economic
grounds alone -- and to the user community, this is
virtually the only measure of success or failure.
It is important to note that translation systems
are not going to &amp;quot;fall out&amp;quot; of Al efforts which are
not seriously contending with multiple languages
from the start. There are two reasons for this.
First, English is not a representative language.
Relatively speaking, it is not even a very hard
language from the standpoint of Computational
Linguistics: Japanese, Chinese, Russian, and even
German, for example, seem more difficult to deal
with using existing CL techniques -- surely in part
due to the nearly total concentration of CL workers
on English. Developing translation ability will
require similar concentration by CL workers on
other languages; nothing less will suffice.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993589">
559
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993">
Second, it would seem that translation is not by
any means a simple matter of understanding the
source text, then reproducing it in the target
language -- even though some translators (and
virtually every layman) will say this is so. On
the one hand, there is the serious question of
whether, in for example the case of an article on
front-line research in semiconductor switching
theory, or nuclear physics, a translator really
does &amp;quot;fully comprehend&amp;quot; the content of the article
he is translating. One would suspect not.
(Johnson (831 makes a point of claiming that he has
produced translations, judged good by informed
peers, in technical areas where his expertise is
deficient, and his understanding, incomplete.) On
the other hand, it is also true that translation
schools expend a great deal of effort teaching
techniques for low-level lexical and syntactic
manipulation -- a curious fact to contrast with the
usual &amp;quot;full comprehension&amp;quot; claim. In any event,
every qualified translator will agree that there is
much more to translation than simple
analysis/synthesis (an almost prima facie proof of
the necessity for Transfer).
What this means is that the development of
translation as an application of Computational
Linguistics will require substantial research in
its own right in addition to the work necessary in
order to provide the basic multi-lingual analysis
and synthesis tools. Translators must be
consulted, for they are the experts in translation.
None of this will happen by accident; it must
result from design.

<abstract confidence="0.956034">Elements of the history, state of the art, and probable future of Machine Translation (MT) are discussed. The treatment is largely tutorial, based on the assumption that this audience is, for the most part, ignorant of matters pertaining to translation in general, and MT in particular. The paper covers some of the major MT R&amp;D groups, the general techniques they employ(ed), and the roles they play(ed) in the development of the field. The conclusions concern the seeming permanence of the translation problem, and potential re-integration of MT with mainstream Computational Linguistics.</abstract>

The Canadian government organized a series of tests and evaluations to assess the status of the system. Among other things, it was discovered that the cost of writing each dictionary entry was remarkably high (3.75 man-hours, costing $35-40), and that the system&apos;s runtime translation cost was also high (6 cents/word) considering the cost of human translation (8 cents/word), especially when the post-editing costs (10 cents/word for TAUM vs. 4 cents/word for human translations) were taken into account [Gervais, 1980]; TAUM was not yet cost-effective. Several other factors, especially the bad Canadian economic situation, combined with this to cause the cancellation of the TAUM project in 1981. There are recent signs of renewed interest in MT in Canada. State-of-the-art surveys have been commissioned [Pierre Isabelle, formerly of TAUM, personal communication], but no successor project has yet been established.
