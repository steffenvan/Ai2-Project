This work investigates lexical organization of
verbs looking at the influence of some linguis-
tic factors on the process of lexical acquisition
and use. Among the factors that may play a
role in acquisition, in this paper we investigate
the influence of polysemy. We examine data
obtained from psycholinguistic action naming
tasks performed by children and adults
(speakers of Brazilian Portuguese), and ana-
lyze some characteristics of the verbs used by
each group in terms of similarity of content,
using Jaccard‟s coefficient, and of topology,
using graph theory. The experiments suggest
that younger children tend to use more poly-
semic verbs than adults to describe events in
the world.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999798433962264">
Lexical acquisition is restrained by perception and
comprehension difficulties, which are associated
with a number of linguistic and psycholinguistic
factors. Among these we can cite age of acquisi-
tion (Ellis and Morrison, 1998; Ellis and Ralph,
2000), frequency (Morrison and Ellis, 1995), syn-
tactic (Ferrer-i-Cancho et al., 2004; Goldberg,
1999; Thompson et. al, 2003) and semantic (Bree-
din et. al, 1998; Barde et al., 2006) characteristics
of words. In terms of semantic features, acquisition
may be influenced by the polysemy and generality
of a word, among others.
In terms of semantic features, acquisition may
be influenced by the generality and polysemy of a
word, among others. For instance, considering
acquisition of verbs in particular, Goldberg (1999)
observes that verbs such as go, put and give are
among those to be acquired first, for they are more
general and frequent, and have lower “semantic
weight” (a relative measure of complexity; Breedin
et. al, 1998; Barde et al., 2006). These verbs,
known as light verbs, not only are acquired first:
they are also known to be more easily used by
aphasics (Breedin et al., 1998; Thompson, 2003;
Thompson et al. 2003; Barde et al. 2006; but see
Kim and Thompson, 2004), which suggest their
great importance for human cognition. The prefe-
rence for light verbs may be explained by the more
general meanings they tend to present and their
more polysemic nature, that is their ability to con-
vey multiple meanings, since the more polysemic
the verb is, the more contexts in which it can be
used (Kim and Thompson, 2004; Barde et al.,
2006). The importance of the number of relation-
ships a word has in the learning environment has
been pointed out by Hills et al. (2009), regardless
of generality. Several factors may influence acqui-
sition, but in this paper we will focus on polysemy.
Understanding how characteristics like polyse-
my influence acquisition is essential for the con-
struction of more precise theories. Therefore, the
hypothesis we investigate is that more polysemous
words have a higher chance of earlier acquisition.
For this purpose, we compare data from children
and adults from the same linguistic community,
native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, in an ac-
tion naming task, looking at lexical evolution by
using statistical and topological analysis of the data
modeled as graphs (following Steyvers and Tenen-
baum, 2005, and Gorman and Curran, 2007). This
approach innovates in the sense that it directly
simulates the influence of a linguistic factor over
the process of lexical evolution.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in
the investigation of language acquisition using
computational models. For instance, some work
has investigated language properties such as age-
of-acquisition effects (Ellis and Ralph, 2000; Li et
al., 2004). Others have simulated aspects of the
acquisition process (Siskind, 1996; Yu, 2005; Yu,
2006; Xu and Tenenbaum, 2007; Fazly et al, 2008)
and lexical growth (Steyvers and Tenenbaum,
2005; Gorman and Curran, 2007).
Some authors employ graph theory metrics to
directly analyze word senses (Sinha and Mihalcea,
2007; Navigli and Lapata, 2007). In this paper,
word senses are implicitly expressed by graph
edges, thus being considered indirectly. Graph
theory has also been successfully used in more
theoretical fields, like the characterization and
comparison of languages (Motter et al., 2002; Fer-
rer-i-Cancho et al., 2004; Masucci and Rodgers,
2006). For example, the works by Sigman and
Cecchi (2002), and Gorman and Curran (2007) use
graph measures to extensively analyze WordNet
properties. Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005) use
some properties of language networks to propose a
model of semantic growth, which is compatible
with the effects of learning history variables, such
as age of acquisition and frequency, in semantic
processing tasks. The approach proposed in this
work follows Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005), and
Gorman and Curran (2007) in the sense of iterative
modifications of graphs, but differs in method (we
use involutions instead of evolutions) and objec-
tive: modifications are motivated by the study of
polysemy instead of production of a given topolog-
ical arrangement. It also follows Deyne and Storms
(2008), in the sense that it directly relates linguistic
factors and graph theory metrics, and Coronges et
al. (2007), in the sense that it compares networks
of different populations with the given approach.
As to Brazilian Portuguese, in particular, Anti-
queira et al. (2007) relate graph theory metrics and
text quality measurement, while Soares et al (2005)
report on a phonetic study. Tonietto et al. (2008)
analyze the influence of pragmatic aspects, such as
conventionality of use, over the lexical organiza-
tion of verbs, and observe that adults tend to prefer
more conventional labels than children.
In this context, this study follows Tonietto et al
(2008) in using data from a psycholinguistic action
naming task. However, the analysis is done in
terms of lexical evolution, by using graph and set
theory metrics (explained below) to understand the
influence of some linguistic characteristics of
words, especially polysemy.

This paper investigates the lexical evolution of
verbs by using data from an action naming task
performed by different age groups: 55 children and
55 young adults. In order to study the evolution of
the lexicon in children, children‟s data are longitu-
dinal; participants of the first data collection (G1)
aged between 2;0 and 3;11 (average 3;1), and in
the second collection (G2), between 4;1 and 6;6
(average 5;5) as described by Tonietto et al.
(2008). The adult group is unrelated to the child-
ren, and aged between 17;0 and 34;0 (average
21;8). The longitudinal data enabled the compari-
son across the lexical evolution of children at age
of acquisition (G1), two years later (G2), and the
reference group of adults (G3). Participants were
shown 17 actions of destruction or division (To-
nietto et al, 2008); answers were preprocessed in
order to eliminate both invalid answers (like “I
don&apos;t know”) and answers with only 1 occurrence
per group. The selection of this particular domain
(destruction and division) is due to its cognitive
importance: it was found to be one of the four con-
ceptual zones, grouping a great amount of verbs1
(Tonietto, 2009).
There were a total of 935 answers per group, out
of which 785, 911 and 917 were valid answers to
G1, G2 and G3, respectively. These made averages
of 46.18, 53.59 and 53.94 valid answers per action,
respectively. The average numbers of distinct valid
answers per action, before merging (explained in
section 3.2), were 6.76, 5.53 and 4, respectively.

The answers given by each participant were col-
lected and annotated two polysemy scores, each
calculated from a different source:
Wscore is the polysemy score of a verb ac-
cording to its number of synsets (synonym
sets) in WordNetBR (Dias-da-Silva et al.,
2000, Maziero, 2008), the Brazilian Portu-
guese version of Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998).
Hscore is the number of different entries for
a verb in the Houaiss dictionary (Houaiss,
2007).
Information about these two scores for each
group is shown in Table 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.99995695">
We notice that most scores, i.e., type and token
Hscores, and token Wscore, decrease as age in-
creases, which is compatible with the hypothesis
investigated. However, due to the limited coverage
of WordNetBR2, some verbs had a null value, and
this is reflected in type Wscore. This is the case of
“serrar” (to saw) which appears in both G1 and
G2, but not in G3.
A comparative analysis of linguistic production
across the different groups is presented in Table 2.
There is a significant similarity across the groups,
with 12 verbs (out of a total of 44) being common
to all of them. In each column, the second graph is
compared to the first. In the “G1-G2” column,
there are 16 verbs common to both graphs, which
represents 64% of the verbs in G2 (with 36% of the
verbs in G2 not appearing in G1). As expected, due
to the proximity in age, results show a higher simi-
larity between G1 and G2 than between G2 and
G3.

Linguistic production of each group was
represented in terms of graphs, whose nodes
represent the verbs mentioned in the task. Verbs
uttered for the same action were assumed to share
semantic information, thus being related to each
other. The existence of conceptual relationships
due to semantic association is in accordance with
Nelson et al. (1998), where implicit semantic rela-
tions were shown to influence on recall and recog-
nition. Therefore, for each age group, all the verbs
uttered for a given action were linked together,
forming a (clique) subgraph. The subgraphs for the
different actions were then connected in a merging
step, through the polysemic words uttered for more
than one action.
As the goal of this research is to investigate
whether a factor such as polysemy has any influ-
ence on language acquisition, we examine the ef-
fects of using it to incrementally change the
network over time. Strategies for network modifi-
cation, such as network growth (Albert and Ba-
rabási, 2002), have been used to help evaluate the
effects of particular factors by iteratively changing
the network (e.g., Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005;
Gorman and Curran, 2007). Network growth in-
crementally adds nodes to an initial state of the
network, by means of some criteria, allowing anal-
ysis of its convergence to a final state. The longi-
tudinal data used in this paper provides references
to both an initial and a final state. However, due to
differences in vocabulary size and content between
the groups, network growth would require com-
plete knowledge of the vocabulary of both the
source and target groups to precisely decide on the
nodes to include and where. Network involution,
the strategy adopted, works in the opposite way
than network growth. It takes an older group graph
as the source and decides on the nodes to iterative-
ly remove, regardless of the younger group graph,
and uses the latter only as a reference for compari-

son of the structure and content of the resulting
graph.
For comparison, graph theory metrics allow us
to measure structural similarity, abstracting away
from the particular verbs in the graphs. Since
graphs represent vocabularies, by these metrics we
aim to analyze vocabulary structure, verifying
whether it is possible for structures to approximate
each other. The graphs were measured in relation
to the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999921714285714">
• number of vertices (n),
• number of edges (M),
• average minimal path length (L),
• density (D),
• average node connectivity (k),
• average clustering coefficient (C/s) 4,
• average number of repetitions (r).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98820056">
L assesses structure in the sense of positioning:
how far the nodes are from one another. D and k
express the relation between number of edges and
number of nodes in different ways; they are a
measure of edge proportion. C/s measures the dis-
tribution of edges among the nodes, assessing the
structure per se. The division by the number of
disconnected subgraphs extends the concept to
account for partitioning. Finally, r captures the
number of different actions for which the same
verb was employed.
Although all metrics are useful for analyzing the
graphs, a subset of four was selected to be used in
the involution process: k, D, L and C/s. With k and
D, we measure semantic share, since that is what
relations among nodes are supposed to mean (see
above). L and C/s are intended to measure vocabu-
lary uniformity, since greater distances and lower
clusterization are related to the presence of subcen-
ters of meaning (again, taking relations as effect of
semantic share).
In order to compare the contents of each graph
as well, we employed a measure of set similarity;
in this case, Jaccard&apos;s similarity coefficient (Jac-
card, 1901). With these measures, we analyze how
close vocabularies of each two groups are in re-
spect to their content. Given two sets A and B, the
Jaccard&apos;s coefficient J can be calculated as fol-
lows:
4 We adopt the local clustering coefficient of Watts and Stro-
gatz (1998), but as the graphs may become disconnected
during network modification, this value is further divided by
the number of subgraphs.
,
where “x” is the number of elements in both A and
B, “y” is the number of elements only in A, and
“z” is the number of elements only in B. For this
purpose, graphs were taken as verb sets, regardless
of their inner relations.
To verify the hypothesis that more polysemic
verbs are more likely to be acquired, by node eli-
mination, verbs were ranked in increasing order of
polysemy (from less to more polysemic verbs).
Therefore, at each step of graph involution, a verb
was selected to be removed, and the resulting
graph was measured. In case of a tie, verbs with
the same polysemy value were randomly selected
until all of them have been removed. Results are
reported in terms of the averages of 10-fold cross-
validation.

A topological analysis of the graphs is shown in
Table 3. As expected, vocabulary size, represented
by n, increases with age, with G1 and G2 being
closer in age and size than G2 and G3. A concomi-
tant decrease in the average connectivity (k) of the
nodes with age suggests vocabulary specialization.
This decrease is even more clearly shown by densi-
ty (D), since it measures the proportion of edges
against the theoretical maximum. As age increases,
so does the average minimal path length (L), with
less paths through each node, which leads to a
more structured and distributed network. Speciali-
zation is again represented by a decrease in r, the
average number of actions for which each verb was
mentioned (the more repeatedly it is mentioned,
the less specialized the vocabulary tends to be).

This research investigates the relation between the
number of meanings and ease of learning, hypothe-
sizing that the more meanings a verb has, the easier
it is to be learned, and the earlier children will use
it. Particularly considering graph theory metrics, if
we remove the verbs with fewer meanings from the
graph of an older group, the overall structure will
approximate to that of a younger group. Consider-
ing set theory metrics, as we remove these verbs,
there should be an increase in the similarity be-
tween the contents of the graphs.
Therefore, the most relevant part of each chart is
its initial state. The verbs to be first removed are
expected to be those that differentiate graphs con-
cerning both structure and content.
Although the previous results in section 4 sug-
gest an influence of polysemy on the lexical organ-
ization of verbs, we intend to use involutions to
confirm these tendencies. Each involution is com-
pared to a random counterpart, making the inter-
pretation easy.

<bodyText confidence="0.999809606060606">
The graph theory metrics (k, L, C/s and D) of the
collected data are shown in Figures 3 and 4 in
terms of 2 lines: network involution with node
removal (a) by using the selected criterion, and (b)
by using random selection (10-fold cross valida-
tion). In addition, each figure also shows the meas-
ure for the younger group as reference (a dashed,
straight, thick line).
In each figure, charts are displayed in four col-
umns and two rows. Each column represents a
graph theory metric, and each row refers to the use
of a different score. For example, the first chart of
each figure is the result of average connectivity (k)
in a complete involution, using Wscore. Each le-
gend refers to all eight charts in the figure.
The results of the simulations from G2 to G1
(Figure 3) show that the four metrics are clearly
distinct from random elimination from the begin-
ning, indicating that polysemy plays a role in the
process. C/s is particularly distinct from random
elimination: while the former remains constant
almost to the end, indicating a highly structured
(clustered) graph, even during node removal, the
random elimination shows effects of graph parti-
tioning. The remaining metrics presented their
greatest approximations to the reference line before
the middle of the chart, suggesting that the initial
verbs were actually the ones differentiating both
graphs. These results suggest an initial increase in
semantic share, as the proportion of edges by node
increases (k and D), and in uniformity, as nodes get
closer to one another (L) and remain clustered
(C/s).

Looking at the involution charts of G3, taking G2
as reference, the same tendencies are maintained,
although not as clearly as the previous results (Fig-
ure 4). The greatest approximations between k and
D happen in the first half of the chart, but much
closer to the middle when compared with Figure 3.
C/s still behaves steadily, remaining stable during
most of the simulation, suggesting maintenance of
the clustered structure.
The quasi-random behavior of L can be ex-
plained by the initial structure of the graphs. They
become progressively sparser as age increases, but
the difference between G3 and G2 is greater than
between G2 and G1 (this was both visually and
statically confirmed). Therefore, G3 would require
too many removals until the most distant nodes
were eliminated, even in an ideal elimination simu-
lation, thus preventing a descent from the begin-
ning. The same can be said about average
connectivity: since G3 has such a low initial score,
and low deviation, even if the nodes with the low-
est degrees were eliminated, it would not result in a
much better result.

and a descent means that “common verbs” were

In addition to Jaccard&apos;s coefficient, we included
the measures for “excluded different” verbs and
“excluded common” verbs (and their random coun-
terparts) in percentage. In this sense, the “Excluded
Different” line presents the percentage of the “dif-
ferent verbs” excluded so far, and similarly in the
“Excluded Common” line. By doing so, it is possi-
ble to measure the exact evolution of both sets
despite the proportion between them (there are
much more “common” than “different” verbs). A
rise in the “Excluded Different” line means that
sets are getting similar, while stabilization (since
descents are not possible) means that they are get-
ting different. The opposite applies to the “Ex-
cluded Common” line. All lines start at 0% and
end at 100%.
In the figures, charts are arranged in columns
(the parameter being measured) and rows (the
score being used). This time, each legend is partic-
ular to each parameter (one to Jaccard&apos;s coefficient
and another to the excluded verbs).
Both simulation sets (Figures 5 and 6) confirm
the expected pattern: an initial increase in the pro-
portion between &amp;quot;different&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; verbs.
Jaccard&apos;s coefficient behaves more satisfactorily in
the second simulation set (Figure 6), where a sharp
rise is observed before the middle of the chart, thus
indicating that many “different verbs” were ex-
cluded. In the first set (Figure 5), Wscore behaves
ambiguously with two rises: one before and anoth-
er after de middle of the chart. Hscore behaves the
same way, but the second rise is much sharper than
the first. Even so, the positive effect of polysemy is
clear in the “Excluded Different” and “Excluded
Common” lines. We notice that the “Excluded
Different” line is usually above the “Excluded
Common” in the beginning and far from the ran-
dom values. Wscore in Figure 5 is an exception,
although a significant rise is observed in the begin-
ning.

random simulation alone (in the C/s metric) con-
firmed a structural stability by using polysemy.
The regular behavior of the Jaccard&apos;s coeffi-
cient in the simulations may be attributed to a high
similarity between the pair of sets: just 45.16% of
the verbs in G3 were able to increase the index,
and just 36% of the verbs in G2 (Table 2). Even so,
an analysis of the “Excluded Different” curves

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997436315789474">
This study investigated the influence of polysemy
on verb acquisition and organization using both
graph and set theory metrics. In general, results
from the topological analysis showed a tendency
towards the reference value, and the greatest simi-
larities were mostly collected in the beginning, as
expected, pointing for a preference of children to
use more polysemous verbs. The static analysis of
the initial graphs (Tables 1, 2 and 3) corroborate
the hypothesis. As a result, we note that not only
does the evolution of human vocabulary lead to a
decrease in the average polysemy measure, but its
structure also evolves according to this linguistic
factor. So we conclude that both the model of invo-
lution and the given analysis are appropriate for
linguistic studies concerning vocabulary evolution.
The analyses highlighted also some interesting
properties reflected in the graphs, such as vocabu-
lary growth and specialization with the increase of
participants&apos; age. In addition, the analysis was
useful in showing that the graphs of the two groups
of children were more similar to each other than to
that of adults, both in structure and content.
For future work, we intend to apply the same
approach to other parameters, such as frequency,
concreteness, and syntactic complexity. As they
may simultaneously influence acquisition, we also
plan to investigate possible combinations of these
factors. We also intend to apply this methodology
to investigate lexical dissolution in the context of
pathologies, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease, and in
parisons with random elimination can be seen as a tendency.
Additionally, the experiments consist of two simulations, over
three different data sets, by using two different sets of polyse-
my, two kinds of metrics, and five different metrics, which
provide robustness to the results.
larger data sets, in order to further confirm the
results obtained so far.

Among the factors that may play a role in acquisition, in this paper we investigate the influence of polysemy. We examine data obtained from psycholinguistic action naming tasks performed by children and adults (speakers of Brazilian Portuguese), and analyze some characteristics of the verbs used by each group in terms of similarity of content, Jaccard‟s coefficient, of topology, using graph theory.

Therefore, for each age group, all the verbs uttered for a given action were linked together, forming a (clique) subgraph. The subgraphs for the different actions were then connected in a merging step, through the polysemic words uttered for more than one action. As the goal of this research is to investigate whether a factor such as polysemy has any influence on language acquisition, we examine the effects of using it to incrementally change the network over time. Strategies for network modification, such as network growth (Albert and Barabási, 2002), have been used to help evaluate the effects of particular factors by iteratively changing the network (e.g., Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005; Gorman and Curran, 2007). Network growth incrementally adds nodes to an initial state of the network, by means of some criteria, allowing analysis of its convergence to a final state. The longitudinal data used in this paper provides references to both an initial and a final state. However, due to differences in vocabulary size and content between the groups, network growth would require complete knowledge of the vocabulary of both the source and target g</context>

The experiments suggest that younger children tend to use more polysemic verbs than adults to describe events in the world. 1 Introduction Lexical acquisition is restrained by perception and comprehension difficulties, which are associated with a number of linguistic and psycholinguistic factors. Among these we can cite age of acquisition (Ellis and Morrison, 1998; Ellis and Ralph, 2000), frequency (Morrison and Ellis, 1995), syntactic (Ferrer-i-Cancho et al., 2004; Goldberg, 1999; Thompson et. al, 2003) and semantic (Breedin et. al, 1998; Barde et al., 2006) characteristics of words. In terms of semantic features, acquisition may be influenced by the polysemy and generality of a word, among others. In terms of semantic features, acquisition may be influenced by the generality and polysemy of a word, among others. For instance, considering acquisition of verbs in particular, Goldberg (1999) observes that verbs such as go, put and give are among those to be acquired first, for they are more general and frequent, and have lower “semantic weight” (a relative measure of complexity; Breedin et. al, 1998; Barde et al., 2006). These verbs, known as light</context>

The preference for light verbs may be explained by the more general meanings they tend to present and their more polysemic nature, that is their ability to convey multiple meanings, since the more polysemic the verb is, the more contexts in which it can be used (Kim and Thompson, 2004; Barde et al., 2006).

The subgraphs for the different actions were then connected in a merging step, through the polysemic words uttered for more than one action. As the goal of this research is to investigate whether a factor such as polysemy has any influence on language acquisition, we examine the effects of using it to incrementally change the network over time. Strategies for network modification, such as network growth (Albert and Barabási, 2002), have been used to help evaluate the effects of particular factors by iteratively changing the network (e.g., Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005; Gorman and Curran, 2007). Network growth incrementally adds nodes to an initial state of the network, by means of some criteria, allowing analysis of its convergence to a final state. The longitudinal data used in this paper provides references to both an initial and a final state. However, due to differences in vocabulary size and content between the groups, network growth would require complete knowledge of the vocabulary of both the source and target groups to precisely decide on the nodes to include and where. Network involution, the strategy adopted, works in the opposite way than network growth. It takes an old</context>

The preference for light verbs may be explained by the more general meanings they tend to present and their more polysemic nature, that is their ability to convey multiple meanings, since the more polysemic the verb is, the more contexts in which it can be used (Kim and Thompson, 2004; Barde et al., 2006). The importance of the number of relationships a word has in the learning environment has been pointed out by Hills et al. (2009), regardless of generality.

L and C/s are intended to measure vocabulary uniformity, since greater distances and lower clusterization are related to the presence of subcenters of meaning (again, taking relations as effect of semantic share). In order to compare the contents of each graph as well, we employed a measure of set similarity; in this case, Jaccard&apos;s similarity coefficient (Jaccard, 1901). With these measures, we analyze how close vocabularies of each two groups are in respect to their content.

The experiments suggest that younger children tend to use more polysemic verbs than adults to describe events in the world. 1 Introduction Lexical acquisition is restrained by perception and comprehension difficulties, which are associated with a number of linguistic and psycholinguistic factors. Among these we can cite age of acquisition (Ellis and Morrison, 1998; Ellis and Ralph, 2000), frequency (Morrison and Ellis, 1995), syntactic (Ferrer-i-Cancho et al., 2004; Goldberg, 1999; Thompson et. al, 2003) and semantic (Breedin et. al, 1998; Barde et al., 2006) characteristics of words. In terms of semantic features, acquisition may be influenced by the polysemy and generality of a word, among others. In terms of semantic features, acquisition may be influenced by the generality and polysemy of a word, among others. For instance, considering acquisition of verbs in particular, Goldberg (1999) observes that verbs such as go, put and give are among those to be acquired first, for they are more general and frequent, a</context>

Understanding how characteristics like polysemy influence acquisition is essential for the construction of more precise theories. Therefore, the hypothesis we investigate is that more polysemous words have a higher chance of earlier acquisition. For this purpose, we compare data from children and adults from the same linguistic community, native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, in an action naming task, looking at lexical evolution by using statistical and topological analysis of the data modeled as graphs (following Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005, and Gorman and Curran, 2007). This approach innovates in the sense that it directly simulates the influence of a linguistic factor over the process of lexical evolution. 52 Proceedings of the NAACL HLT 2010 First Workshop on Computational Neurolinguistics, pages 52–60, Los Angeles, California, June 2010. c�2010 Association for Computational Linguistics This paper is structured as follows.

As the goal of this research is to investigate whether a factor such as polysemy has any influence on language acquisition, we examine the effects of using it to incrementally change the network over time. Strategies for network modification, such as network growth (Albert and Barabási, 2002), have been used to help evaluate the effects of particular factors by iteratively changing the network (e.g., Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005; Gorman and Curran, 2007). Network growth incrementally adds nodes to an initial state of the network, by means of some criteria, allowing analysis of its convergence to a final state. The longitudinal data used in this paper provides references to both an initial and a final state. However, due to differences in vocabulary size and content between the groups, network growth would require complete knowledge of the vocabulary of both the source and target groups to precisely decide on the nodes to include and where.

In terms of semantic features, acquisition may be influenced by the generality and polysemy of a word, among others. For instance, considering acquisition of verbs in particular, Goldberg (1999) observes that verbs such as go, put and give are among those to be acquired first, for they are more general and frequent, and have lower “semantic weight” (a relative measure of complexity; Breedin et. al, 1998; Barde et al., 2006). These verbs, known as light verbs, not only are acquired first: they are also known to be more easily used by aphasics (Breedin et al., 1998; Thompson, 2003; Thompson et al. 2003; Barde et al. 2006; but see Kim and Thompson, 2004), which suggest their great importance for human cognition. The preference for light verbs may be explained by the more general meanings they tend to present and their more polysemic nature, that is their ability to convey multiple meanings, since the more polysemic the verb is, the more contexts in which it can be used (Kim and Thompson, 2004; Barde et al., 2006).

Participants were shown 17 actions of destruction or division (Tonietto et al, 2008); answers were preprocessed in order to eliminate both invalid answers (like “I don&apos;t know”) and answers with only 1 occurrence per group. The selection of this particular domain (destruction and division) is due to its cognitive importance: it was found to be one of the four conceptual zones, grouping a great amount of verbs1 (Tonietto, 2009). There were a total of 935 answers per group, out of which 785, 911 and 917 were valid answers to G1, G2 and G3, respectively. These made averages of 46.18, 53.59 and 53.94 valid answers per action, respectively. The average numbers of distinct valid answers per action, before merging (explained in section 3.2), were 6.76, 5.53 and 4, respectively. 1 The others are evasion, excitation, and union. 53 The answers given by each participant were collected and annotated two polysemy scores, each calculated from a different source: Wscore is the polysemy score of a verb according to its number of s</context>

In order to compare the contents of each graph as well, we employed a measure of set similarity; in this case, Jaccard&apos;s similarity coefficient (Jaccard, 1901). With these measures, we analyze how close vocabularies of each two groups are in respect to their content. Given two sets A and B, the Jaccard&apos;s coefficient J can be calculated as follows: 4 We adopt the local clustering coefficient of Watts and Strogatz (1998), but as the graphs may become disconnected during network modification, this value is further divided by the number of subgraphs. , where “x” is the number of elements in both A and B, “y” is the number of elements only in A, and “z” is the number of elements only in B. For this purpose, graphs were taken as verb sets, regardless of their inner relations. To verify the hypothesis that more polysemic verbs are more likely to be acquired, by node elimination, verbs were ranked in increasing order of polysemy (from less to more polysemic verbs).

Section 3 presents the materials and methods employed in the experiments of the present work. Sections 4 and 5 present the results, and section 6 concludes and presents future work. 2 Related Work In recent years, there has been growing interest in the investigation of language acquisition using computational models. For instance, some work has investigated language properties such as ageof-acquisition effects (Ellis and Ralph, 2000; Li et al., 2004). Others have simulated aspects of the acquisition process (Siskind, 1996; Yu, 2005; Yu, 2006; Xu and Tenenbaum, 2007; Fazly et al, 2008) and lexical growth (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005; Gorman and Curran, 2007). Some authors employ graph theory metrics to directly analyze word senses (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007; Navigli and Lapata, 2007). In this paper, word senses are implicitly expressed by graph edges, thus being considered indirectly. Graph theory has also been successfully used in more theoretical fields, like the characterization and comparison of languages (Motter et al., 2002; Ferrer-i-Cancho et al., 2004; Masucci and Rodgers, 2006). For example, the works by Sigman and Cecchi (2002), and Gorman and </context>
