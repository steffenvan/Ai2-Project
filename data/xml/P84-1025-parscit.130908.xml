There are various difficulties in accomodating the traditional
mass/count distinction into a grammar for English which
has a goal the production of &amp;quot;logical form&amp;quot; semantic
translations of the initial English sentences. The present
paper surveys , some of these difficulties. One puzzle is
whether the distinction is a syntactic one or a semantic
one, i.e., whether it is a well-formedness constraint or
whether it is a description of the semantic translations
produced. Another puzzle is whether it should be applied
to simple words (as they occur in the lexicon) or whether
it should apply only to longer units (such as entire NPs).
Of the wide variety of possible theories, only two seem to
produce the required results (having to do with plausible
inferences and intuitively satisfying semantic representations).
These two theories are developed and compared.
According to Montague (Thomason 1974), Gazdar
(Gazdar et al 1984) and a rapidly growing number of
linguists, philosophers, and Al researchers, the logical form
underlying sentences of a natural language are
systematically—and simply- -determined by the syntactic form
of those sentences. This view is in contrast with a tacit
assumption often made in Al. that computation of logical
translations requires throngs of more or less arbitrary rules
operating upon syntactic forms.&apos;
The following are a few grammar rules in
approximately the style of Gazdar&apos;s Generalized Phrase
Structure Grammar (GPSG). They differ from Gazdar&apos;s
primarily in that they are designed to produce more or
less &amp;quot;conventional&amp;quot; logical translations, rather than the
intensional ones of Montague and Gazdar (for details see
Schubert &amp; Pelletier 1982). Each rule consists of a rule
number, a phrase structure rule, and a semantic (logical
translation) rule.

Parsing and translating in accordance with such rules is a
fairly straightforward matter. Since the syntactic rules are
context free, standard context-free parsing methods can be
employed, except that allowance must be made for the
propagation of features, with due regard for concord.
&apos;The work reported herein was partially supported by
NSERC grants A5525 (FJP) and A8818 (LKS). We also
wish to thank Matthew Dryer, David Justice, Bernard
Linsky, and other members of the Univ. Alberta Logical
Grammar Study Group for discussions on these topics.
Applying the rules of translation is even simpler. In
essence, all that is needed is a mechanism for arranging
logical expressions into larger expressions in conformity with
the semantic rules. (For examples of parsers see Thompson
1981, Schubert &amp; Pelletier 1982, Gawron et al 1982,
Rosenschein &amp; Shieber 1982).
The topic of mass terms and predicates has a
substantial literature within both linguistics and philosophical
logic, with much of the recent research deriving inspiration
from Montague Grammar (e.g., see Pelletier 1979, ter
Meulen 1980, Bunt 1981, Chierchia 1982). There are three
views on the mass/count distinction, namely that the
distinction is (a) syntactic, (b) semantic, and (c)
pragmatic. Orthogonal to these views we have the further
possibilities (0 that the mass/count distinction is lexical,
and (ii) that it is determined by the context in which the
expression occurs. We shall present arguments in the full
paper to eliminate position (c), leaving us with four
possible kinds of theories. (1) a syntactic expression
(lexical) approach, (2) a syntactic occurrence approach, (3)
a semantic expression approach, and (4) a semantic
occurrence approach. This raises the question of what is
the difference between syntactic approaches generally and
semantic approaches generally. A syntactic approach treats
+mass and +count as syntactic classifications or features,
that is as features to be used by the syntactic rules in
determining whether some longer stretch of words is
well-formed. Central to the semantic approach is the claim
that +count and +mass are not syntactic features or
categories, but rather are a description of the semantic
representation of the expression. In this approach, no
syntactic rules refer to +count or +mass (since these are
not syntactic objects). Rather, in sentences like Mary put
apple in the salad vs. Mary put an apple in the salad,
the semantic approaches allow us to say that it was a
mass or count semantic representation of apple only after
inspecting the kind of thing that apple is true of in the
sentences.
There are reasons for rejecting options (2) and (3),
thus leaving us with only a syntactic expression approach
and a semantic occurrence approach. (The reasons are
given in Pelletier &amp; Schubert 1985). These are the two
theories of mass expressions that are to be discussed in
the paper. They seem to us to be the most plausible
candidates for an adequate theory of the logical form of
sentences involving mass expressions. The fragment of
English that the two theories of mass expressions are
concerned with is roughly those sentences with a copular
verb and either a mass or count expression as predicate.
and whose subjects are either bare noun phrases or
quantified noun phrases. A sentence is a noun phrase and
a verb phrase. A verb phrase is a copula followed by a

4(.vhich in turn is either a bare noun (as in Claret is wine
or This puddle is man - -the latter said after an
application of the universal grinder)&apos; or an a followed by
a noun (as in John is a man or Claret is a wine) or is
an entire noun phrase (as in John is the man most likely
to succeed or Claret is my favourite red wine). A noun
phrase is either a bare noun (as in Claret is a dry red
wine or Dogs are barking outside) or else is a quantified
term (as in All men are mortal or Sm red wine is tasty
--we include as determiners this, all, some, sm, much, little,
each, every, and the numeral quantifiers). Nouns may
themselves be either an adjective-phrase noun combination,
or just a noun. We consider here two cases of adjective
modification: intersective and non-intersective. For the
former we have in mind such adjectives as red, while for
the latter we think of such adjectives as fake.
The rules which give alternatives, such as 3p vs.
3s, are those rules which are different for the two theories
of mass terms. The p-rules are for the semantic
occurrence approach while the s-rules are for the syntactic
expression approach. The ontological underpinnings of these
theories are that &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot; contains two sorts of items: (1)
&amp;quot;ordinary objects&amp;quot; such as rings, sofas, puddles (and
including here what many theorists have called &amp;quot;quantities
of matter&amp;quot;), (2) &amp;quot;kinds&amp;quot;, that is, &amp;quot;varieties&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;substances&amp;quot;.
etc. We have in mind here such items as wine, claret, red
wine, and the like, and also servings of such items. We
wish to make no special metaphysical claims about the
relationships that might hold between &amp;quot;ordinary objects&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;kinds&amp;quot;- -instead we content ourselves with describing
how such an ontology leads to a simple and natural
description of various of the facts concerning mass (and
possibly plural) expressions. Linguistically, that is
semantically, we take there to be three distinct types of
predicates: (a) those which apply only to &amp;quot;kinds&amp;quot;, e.g., is
a substance, is scarce, is a kind of wine, is abundant, (b)
those which apply only to &amp;quot;objects&amp;quot;, e.g., is a quantity of
gold, is a puddle, and (c) those which can apply to both
&amp;quot;kinds&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;objects&amp;quot;. In this last group we have in mind
mass predicates such as is wine, is furniture, is food, and
is computer software.
Both of these theories take it that is wine is true
of the (abstract) kind claret in addition to an individual
quantity such as the contents of this glass. Moreover, they
take is wine to be true of an object such as a drop or
puddle of wine, occupying the same region as some
quantity of wine. (This ring is gold or This hamburger is
food are clearer examples of the application of mass
predicates to objects.) Generally speaking, the theories view
the kinds of M as forming an upper semilattice of kinds
with M at the top. This is a &amp;quot;formal&amp;quot; semilattice in that
the union of any two elements of it is a member of the
semilattice, and we view is wine as being true of any of
these formal kinds. So a sentence like Cheap wine is wine
will be true, since cheap wine names an element of the
semilattice. Predicates like is a wine are true of
conventionally recognized kinds (Claret is a wine is true)
but not of every &amp;quot;formal&amp;quot; kind since, e.g., Cheap wine is
The universal grinder (Pelletier 1975) takes objects
corresponding to any count noun, grinds them up and
spews the result from the other end. Put a table into it
and after a few minutes there is sm table on the floor.
(We regularly represent the unstressed some by sm.)
a wine is not true. (Sauterne mixed with claret is a wine
is also not true, showing that is a wine is not true of
unions of elements of the semilattice). These predicates are
not only true of the conventional kinds but also of
conventional servings such as the bottle of wine on the
table or the 250m1 in this glass. Note that these can again
be abstract entities: but rather than potentially being
abstract conventional kinds of wine, they can be abstract
conventional kinds of servings of wine. Finally such
predicates are true of individual quantities- -as when we say
we have ordered four wines, all of the same kind and
size. When a bare mass noun phrase (or indeed other bare
noun phrases, although we shall not dwell on them here)
is used as a subject (or object, but again we shall not
consider that here), it is taken to name the kind. So in
Cheap wine is wine, the subject cheap wine names a kind;
and since the sentence is true it must name a &amp;quot;formal
kind&amp;quot; so that is wine can be predicated of it. But since
Cheap wine is a wine is not true, the formal kind cannot
be a conventionally recognized kind (nor, for that matter,
a conventional serving nor an individual quantity). Both
theories hold that mass CN&apos;s should be translated into the
semantics as predicates. Strictly this is not required: for,
all we have given direct evidence for is that mass VP&apos;s be
translated as predicates with a mixed object/kind extension.
It could be the case that mass CN&apos;s are quite different,
yet in the formation of a mass VP the entire VP gets
assigned a mixed, predicate denotation. Still, it would be
simple, and in keeping with much philosophical and
linguistic analysis, to assume coincidence of CN and &amp;quot;is
CN&amp;quot; denotations (at least when tense is ignored, as here).
With just this much of the theory sketched, we
can overcome various of the difficulties that plagued other
theories. For example, it is most unclear that any other
theory can adequately translate sentences like
Tap water is water
This puddle is water
Consider also sentences like
All wine is wine
wherein the subject all wine seems to quantify over both
kinds of wine and quantities of wine, entailing both White
wine is wine and The litre of wine in this bottle is wine,
for example. It seems to us that no other theory allows
this comprehensiveness. An even clearer example of such
comprehensive denotation is (a), from which both of (b)
and (c) follow, given that rice is edible and this sandwich
is edible. (Note also the comprehensive denotation of
edible). No other theory we know of can account for the
validity of these two arguments.

a. Everything edible is food
b. Rice is food
c. This sandwich is food

<bodyText confidence="0.999692777777778">
Both of these theories will want to be able, in the
semantics, to form predicates which are true of kinds, or
of servings, or of individuals, given a predicate which has
comprehensive extension. So, for example, from the
predicate water&apos; which is assumed to be true of quantities,
servings, and kinds, we shall want to be able to form (k
water&apos;) which is true of conventional kinds of water, to
form (p water&apos;) which is true of conventional portions
(and kinds of portions) of water, and to form (q water&apos;)

<bodyText confidence="0.999918230769231">
which is true of quantities of water. Conversely, if we
have a predicate which is true of individuals and kinds,
we shall want to form a predicate true of all the entities
that mass predicates are true of- -quantities of stuff, kinds
of stuff, and objects coincident with quantities of stuff.
For example, if man&apos; is a predicate true of objects and
kinds, then (s man&apos;) is the mass predicate formed
therefrom. Also, we shall want to be able to form the
name of a kind from a predicate: (A water&apos;) is the name
of the kind water and (A (cheap&apos;(wine&apos;)) is the name of
the kind cheap wine.
The rules for the relevant portion of our two
theories are (I is our symbol for lambda abstraction):

The S-theory distinguishes in the lexicon mass from count
nouns. And it has what might be called &amp;quot;lexical extension&amp;quot;
rules to give us the &amp;quot;stretched&amp;quot; meaning of nouns that we
have earlier talked about. For example, it has
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.91333025">
[N +COUNT] * sofa, man, substance, ...
[N +MASS] * wine, water, ...
[N +COUNT] • [N 4-MASS], (k N&apos;)

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.98469996969697">
[N +MASS] o [N +COUNT], (s N&apos;)
Now, both of these theories can give the correct semantic
representation to a wide range of sentences involving mass
terms, given certain meaning postulates. (The two theories
do it slightly differently, as might be expected since they
have somewhat different semantic understandings of the
lexical nouns. For example, the s-theory takes man to be
true of individual men and of kinds of men, while the
p-theory takes it also to be true of the stuff of which
men are made. In the p-theory, when a sentence uses a
--as in a man - -then the semantic operators convert this
&amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; meaning into one that is true of individual men
and of kinds of men. The s-theory rather has a lexical
extension rule which will convert the lexical count noun
man into one which is a mass noun and is true of the
stuff of which men are made. They will also take a
different tack on what quantified terms designate, although
that has been hidden in rule 8 above by assigning the
same logical form to both theories. Nonetheless, the
meaning postulates of the two theories will differ for
these.) In addition to the sorts of examples stated above,
both these theories can generate and give the correct
logical form to such sentences as
Wine is wine (two readings, both analytic)
Wine is a wine (false)
All wine is wine (analytic)
Claret is a wine (true)
Cheap wine is a wine (false)
All wine is a wine (semantically anomalous)
Water is dripping from the faucet (entails: sm water
is dripping from the faucet)
Water is a liquid (entails: water is liquid)
Both theories make the following six inferences valid

4. Claret is a wine, wine is liquid, so claret is liquid

We know of no other theories which can do all these
things. Yet the two theories are radically different: one
has a mass/count distinction in the syntax and the other
doesn&apos;t, and they have different extensions assigned to the
lexical items. So the question naturally arises- -which is
better? What can be said against the two theories? There
is not space in a paper of this size to go into this in
detail, so we shall content ourselves with just hurling the
main charge that each one directs against the other.
Briefly, the p-theory charges the s-theory with
pretending to use syntactic features +mass and +count but
allowing them to do no syntactic work. For every sentence
which has a mass term in a given location, there is
another sentence which has a count term in that position.
No constructions are ruled out; the only use of the
+mass/ +count features is in directing the semantic
translation process. And that suggests that the features
should all along have been semantic. The s-theory charges
the p-theory with being unable to give coherent meaning
postulates because of its committment to a comprehensive
extension to the lexical terms. For example, suppose one
wanted to give as a meaning (or factual) postulate that A
lamb has fur. The s-theory can do this without difficulty:
lamb&apos; is true of individual lambs and the meaning postulate
says of each of them that they have fur. But the
p-theory cannot easily do this: lamb&apos; is true of stuff, so
the predicate must be converted to one which is true of
individuals. But there is no provision in the p-theory for
doing this- -the closest that it could come is with a
predicate that is true of both conventional kinds and
&amp;quot;conventional portions&amp;quot; (i.e., ordinary lambs).
Given the above rules (augmented with additional
features such as number and person agreement features in
rule 1) we are able to extend the capabilities of our
parsers (Schubert &amp; Pelletier 1982) so that they deliver
logical form translations of sentences involving mass
expressions. These translations have the desired semantic
properties and, with an extension of the inference
mechanisms to allow for predicate modification and
A-abstraction, allow the above valid arguments to be
duplicated. So, which theory is to be preferred? That is a
topic for further research. The time for studies of mass

expressions with only casual reference to the syntax and
semantics of language is past. Only systematic attempts to
account for large classes of mass expressions within formal
syntactic-semantic-pragmatic frameworks can hope to resolve
the remaining issues.

The ontological underpinnings of these theories are that &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot; contains two sorts of items: (1) &amp;quot;ordinary objects&amp;quot; such as rings, sofas, puddles (and including here what many theorists have called &amp;quot;quantities of matter&amp;quot;), (2) &amp;quot;kinds&amp;quot;, that is, &amp;quot;varieties&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;substances&amp;quot;. etc. We have in mind here such items as wine, claret, red wine, and the like, and also servings of such items. We wish to make no special metaphysical claims about the relationships that might hold between &amp;quot;ordinary objects&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;kinds&amp;quot;- -instead we content ourselves with describing how such an ontology leads to a simple and natural description of various of the facts concerning mass (and possibly plural) expressions. Linguistically, that is semantically, we take there to be three distinct types of (a) those which apply only to &amp;quot;kinds&amp;quot;, e.g., substance, is scarce, is a kind of wine, is abundant, which apply only to &amp;quot;objects&amp;quot;, e.g., a quantity of is a puddle, (c) those which can apply to both &amp;quot;kinds&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;objects&amp;quot;. In this last group we have in mind predicates such as wine, is furniture, is food, is computer software. of these theories take it that wine true of the (abstract) kind claret in addition to an individual quantity such as the contents of this glass. Moreover, they wine be true of an object such as a drop or puddle of wine, occupying the same region as some of (This ring is gold hamburger is clearer examples of the application of mass predicates to objects.) Generally speaking, the theories view the kinds of M as forming an upper semilattice of kinds with M at the top. This is a &amp;quot;formal&amp;quot; semilattice in that the union of any two elements of it is a member of the and we view wine being true of any of formal kinds. So a sentence like wine is wine be true, since wine names element of the Predicates like a wine true of recognized kinds is a wine true) not of every &amp;quot;formal&amp;quot; kind since, e.g., wine is The universal grinder (Pelletier 1975) takes objects corresponding to any count noun, grinds them up and spews the result from the other end. Put a table into it and after a few minutes there is sm table on the floor. regularly represent the unstressed wine not true. mixed with claret is a wine not true, showing that a wine not true of unions of elements of the semilattice). These predicates are not only true of the conventional kinds but also of conventional servings such as the bottle of wine on the table or the 250m1 in this glass. Note that these can again be abstract entities: but rather than potentially being abstract conventional kinds of wine, they can be abstract conventional kinds of servings of wine. Finally such predicates are true of individual quantities- -as when we say we have ordered four wines, all of the same kind and size. When a bare mass noun phrase (or indeed other bare noun phrases, although we shall not dwell on them here) is used as a subject (or object, but again we shall not that here), it is taken to name the kind. So wine is wine, subject wine names kind; and since the sentence is true it must name a &amp;quot;formal so that wine be predicated of it. But since wine is a wine is true, the formal kind cannot be a conventionally recognized kind (nor, for that matter, a conventional serving nor an individual quantity). Both theories hold that mass CN&apos;s should be translated into the semantics as predicates. Strictly this is not required: for, all we have given direct evidence for is that mass VP&apos;s be translated as predicates with a mixed object/kind extension. It could be the case that mass CN&apos;s are quite different, yet in the formation of a mass VP the entire VP gets assigned a mixed, predicate denotation. Still, it would be simple, and in keeping with much philosophical and linguistic analysis, to assume coincidence of CN and &amp;quot;is CN&amp;quot; denotations (at least when tense is ignored, as here). With just this much of the theory sketched, we can overcome various of the difficulties that plagued other theories. For example, it is most unclear that any other theory can adequately translate sentences like Tap water is water This puddle is water Consider also sentences like All wine is wine the subject wine to quantify over both of wine and quantities of wine, entailing both is wine litre of wine in this bottle is wine, for example. It seems to us that no other theory allows this comprehensiveness. An even clearer example of such comprehensive denotation is (a), from which both of (b) and (c) follow, given that rice is edible and this sandwich is edible. (Note also the comprehensive denotation of other theory we know of can account for the validity of these two arguments. a. Everything edible is food b. Rice is food c. This sandwich is food Both of these theories will want to be able, in the semantics, to form predicates which are true of kinds, or of servings, or of individuals, given a predicate which has comprehensive extension. So, for example, from the predicate water&apos; which is assumed to be true of quantities, servings, and kinds, we shall want to be able to form (k water&apos;) which is true of conventional kinds of water, to which is true of conventional portions kinds of portions) of water, and to form (q 109 which is true of quantities of water. Conversely, if we have a predicate which is true of individuals and kinds, we shall want to form a predicate true of all the entities that mass predicates are true of- -quantities of stuff, kinds of stuff, and objects coincident with quantities of stuff. example, if a predicate true of objects and then (s the mass predicate formed therefrom. Also, we shall want to be able to form the of a kind from a predicate: is the name of the kind water and (A (cheap&apos;(wine&apos;)) is the name of the kind cheap wine. The rules for the relevant portion of our two theories are (I is our symbol for lambda abstraction):</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.98395581">The S-theory distinguishes in the lexicon mass from count nouns. And it has what might be called &amp;quot;lexical extension&amp;quot; rules to give us the &amp;quot;stretched&amp;quot; meaning of nouns that we have earlier talked about. For example, it has +COUNT] * man, substance, ... +MASS] water, ... [N +COUNT] • [N 4-MASS], (k N&apos;) +COUNT] * [N +MASS], [N +MASS] o [N +COUNT], (s N&apos;) Now, both of these theories can give the correct semantic representation to a wide range of sentences involving mass terms, given certain meaning postulates. (The two theories do it slightly differently, as might be expected since they have somewhat different semantic understandings of the lexical nouns. For example, the s-theory takes man to be true of individual men and of kinds of men, while the p-theory takes it also to be true of the stuff of which men are made. In the p-theory, when a sentence uses a in a -then the semantic operators convert this &amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; meaning into one that is true of individual men and of kinds of men. The s-theory rather has a lexical extension rule which will convert the lexical count noun one which is a mass noun and is true of the stuff of which men are made. They will also take a different tack on what quantified terms designate, although that has been hidden in rule 8 above by assigning the same logical form to both theories. Nonetheless, the meaning postulates of the two theories will differ for these.) In addition to the sorts of examples stated above, both these theories can generate and give the correct logical form to such sentences as Wine is wine (two readings, both analytic) Wine is a wine (false) All wine is wine (analytic) Claret is a wine (true) Cheap wine is a wine (false) All wine is a wine (semantically anomalous) Water is dripping from the faucet (entails: sm water is dripping from the faucet) Water is a liquid (entails: water is liquid) Both theories make the following six inferences valid 1. Claret is a wine, wine is a liquid, so claret is a liquid 2. Claret is a wine, wine is a liquid, so claret is liquid 3. Claret is a wine, wine is liquid, so claret is a liquid 4. Claret is a wine, wine is liquid, so claret is liquid 5. Claret is wine, wine is a liquid, so claret is liquid 6. Claret is wine, wine is liquid, so claret is liquid And they both make these two inferences invalid 7. Claret is wine, wine is a liquid, so claret is a liquid 8. Claret is wine, wine is liquid, so claret is a liquid We know of no other theories which can do all these things. Yet the two theories are radically different: one has a mass/count distinction in the syntax and the other doesn&apos;t, and they have different extensions assigned to the lexical items. So the question naturally arises- -which is better? What can be said against the two theories? There is not space in a paper of this size to go into this in detail, so we shall content ourselves with just hurling the main charge that each one directs against the other. Briefly, the p-theory charges the s-theory with pretending to use syntactic features +mass and +count but allowing them to do no syntactic work. For every sentence which has a mass term in a given location, there is another sentence which has a count term in that position. No constructions are ruled out; the only use of the +mass/ +count features is in directing the semantic translation process. And that suggests that the features should all along have been semantic. The s-theory charges the p-theory with being unable to give coherent meaning postulates because of its committment to a comprehensive extension to the lexical terms. For example, suppose one to give as a meaning (or factual) postulate that has fur. s-theory can do this without difficulty: lamb&apos; is true of individual lambs and the meaning postulate says of each of them that they have fur. But the cannot easily do this: true of stuff, so the predicate must be converted to one which is true of individuals. But there is no provision in the p-theory for doing this- -the closest that it could come is with a predicate that is true of both conventional kinds and &amp;quot;conventional portions&amp;quot; (i.e., ordinary lambs). Given the above rules (augmented with additional features such as number and person agreement features in rule 1) we are able to extend the capabilities of our parsers (Schubert &amp; Pelletier 1982) so that they deliver logical form translations of sentences involving mass expressions. These translations have the desired semantic properties and, with an extension of the inference mechanisms to allow for predicate modification and A-abstraction, allow the above valid arguments to be duplicated. So, which theory is to be preferred? That is a topic for further research. The time for studies of mass 110 expressions with only casual reference to the syntax and semantics of language is past. Only systematic attempts to account for large classes of mass expressions within formal syntactic-semantic-pragmatic frameworks can hope to resolve the remaining issues.</abstract>

Another puzzle is whether it should be applied to simple words (as they occur in the lexicon) or whether it should apply only to longer units (such as entire NPs). Of the wide variety of possible theories, only two seem to produce the required results (having to do with plausible inferences and intuitively satisfying semantic representations). These two theories are developed and compared. According to Montague (Thomason 1974), Gazdar (Gazdar et al 1984) and a rapidly growing number of linguists, philosophers, and Al researchers, the logical form underlying sentences of a natural language are systematically—and simply- -determined by the syntactic form of those sentences. This view is in contrast with a tacit assumption often made in Al. that computation of logical translations requires throngs of more or less arbitrary rules operating upon syntactic forms.&apos; The following are a few grammar rules in approximately the style of Gazdar&apos;s Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG).
