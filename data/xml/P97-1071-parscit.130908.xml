Being able to predict the placement of con-
trastive accent is essential for the assign-
ment of correct accentuation patterns in
spoken language generation. I discuss two
approaches to the generation of contrastive
accent and propose an alternative method
that is feasible and computationally at-
tractive in data-to-speech systems.

<bodyText confidence="0.999926238095238">
The placement of pitch accent plays an important
role in the interpretation of spoken messages. Utter-
ances having the same surface structure but a differ-
ent accentuation pattern may express very different
meanings. A generation system for spoken language
should therefore be able to produce appropriate ac-
centuation patterns for its output messages.
One of the factors determining accentuation is
contrast. Its importance can be illustrated with
an example from GoalGetter, a data-to-speech sys-
tem which generates spoken soccer reports in Dutch
(Klabbers et al., 1997). The input of the system is
a typed data structure containing data on a soccer
match. So-called syntactic templates (van Deemter
and Odijk, 1995) are used to express parts of this
data structure. In GoalGetter, only &apos;new&apos; inform-
ation is accented; &apos;given&apos; (&apos;old&apos;) information is not
(Chafe, 1976), (Brown, 1983), (Hirschberg, 1992).
However, this strategy does not always lead to a cor-
rect accentuation pattern if contrastive information
is not taken into account, as shown in example (1).1

The word Ajax in (1)b is not accented by the sys-
tem, because it is mentioned for the second time and
therefore regarded as &apos;given&apos;. However, this lack of
accent creates the impression that Kluivert scored
for Ajax too, whereas in fact he scored for the op-
posing team through an own goal. This undesirable
effect could be avoided by accenting the second oc-
currence of Ajax in spite of its givenness, to indicate
that it constitutes contrastive information.

2 Predicting contrastive accent
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995691185185185">
In this section I discuss two approaches to predicting
contrastive accent, which were put forward by Scott
Prevost (1995) and Stephen Pulman (1997).
In the theory of contrast proposed in (Prevost,
1995), an item receives contrastive accent if it co-
occurs with another item that belongs to its &apos;set of
alternatives&apos;, i.e. a set of different items of the same
type. There are two main problems with this ap-
proach. First, as Prevost himself notes, it is very
difficult to define exactly which items count as be-
ing of &apos;the same type&apos;. If the definition is too strict,
not all cases of contrast will be accounted for. On
the other hand, if it is too broad, then anything will
be predicted to contrast with anything. A second
problem is that there are cases where co-occurrence
of two items of the same type does not trigger con-
trast, as in the following soccer example:
(2) a After six minutes Nilis scored a goal for PS V.
This caused Ajax to fall behind.
Twenty minutes later Cocu scored for PSV.
According to Prevost&apos;s theory, PSV in (2)c should
have a contrastive accent, because the two teams
Ajax and PSV are obviously in each other&apos;s altern-
ative set. In fact, though, there is no contrast and
PSV should be normally deaccented due to given-
ness. This shows that the presence of an alternative
item is not sufficient to trigger contrast accent.

<bodyText confidence="0.999895073170732">
Another approach to contrastive accent is advoc-
ated by Pulman (1997), who proposes to use higher
order unification (HOU) for both interpretation and
prediction of focus. Described informally, Pulman&apos;s
focus assignment algorithm takes the semantic rep-
resentation of a sentence which has just been gener-
ated, looks in the context for another sentence rep-
resentation containing parallel items, and abstracts
over these items in both representations. If the
resulting representations are unifiable, the two sen-
tences stand in a contrast relation and the parallel
elements from the most recent one receive a pitch
accent (or another focus marker).
Pulman does not give a full definition of parallel-
ism, but states that &amp;quot;to be parallel, two items need
to be at least of the same type and have the same
sortal properties&amp;quot; ((Pulman, 1997), p. 90). This is
rather similar to Prevost&apos;s conditions on alternative
sets. Consequently, Pulman&apos;s theory also faces the
problem of determining when two items are of the
same type. Still, contrary to Prevost, Pulman can
explain the lack of contrast accent in (2)c, because
obviously the representations of sentences (2)b and
(2)c will not unify.
Another advantage, pointed out in (Gardent et al.,
1996), is that a HOU algorithm can take world know-
ledge into account, which is sometimes necessary for
determining contrast. For instance, the contrast in
(1) is based on the knowledge that kicking the ball
into the wrong goal implies scoring a goal for the
opposing team. In a HOU approach, the contrast
in this example might be predicted by unifying the
representation of the second sentence with the entail-
ment of the first. However, such a strategy would
require the explicit enumeration of all possible se-
mantic equivalences and entailments in the relevant
domain, which seems hardly feasible. Also, imple-
mentation of higher order unification can be quite
inefficient. This means that although theoretically
appealing, the HOU approach to contrastive accent
is less attractive from a computational viewpoint.

3 An alternative solution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996008">
Fortunately, in data-to-speech systems like GoalGet-
ter, the input of which is formed by typed and struc-
tured data, a simple principle can be used for de-
termining contrast. If two subsequent sentences are
generated from the same type of data structure they
express similar information and should therefore be
regarded as potentially contrastive, even if their sur-
face forms are different. Pitch accent should be as-
signed to those parts of the second sentence that ex-
press data which differ from those in the data struc-
ture expressed by the first sentence.
Example (1) can be used as illustration. The the-
ory of Prevost will not predict contrastive accent on
Ajax in (1)b, because (1)a does not contain a mem-
ber of its alternative set. In Pulman&apos;s approach, the
contrast can only be predicted if the system uses
the world knowledge that scoring an own goal means
scoring for the opposing team. In the approach that
I propose, the contrast between (1)a and b can be de-
rived directly from the data structures they express.
Figure 1 shows these structures, A and B, which are
both of the type goal_event: a record with fields spe-
cifying the team for which a goal was scored, the
player who scored, the time and the kind of goal:
normal, own goal or penalty.

<bodyText confidence="0.972266740740741">
Since A and B are of the same type, the values of
their fields can be compared, showing which pieces
of information are contrastive. Figure 1 shows that
all the fields of B have different values from those of
A. This means that each phrase in (1)b which ex-
presses the value of one of those fields should receive
contrastive accent,2 even if the corresponding field
value of A was not mentioned in (1)a. This guar-
antees that in (1)b the proper name Ajax, which
expresses the value of the team field of B, is accen-
ted despite the fact that the contrasting team was
not explicitly mentioned in (1)a.
The discussion of example (1) shows that in
the approach proposed here no world knowledge is
needed to determine contrast; it is only necessary
to compare the data structures that are expressed
by the generated sentences. The fact that the input
data structures of the system are organized in such
a way that identical data types express semantically
parallel information allows us to make use of the
world (or domain) knowledge incorporated in the
design of these data structures, without having to
separately encode this knowledge. This also means
2Sentence (1)b happens not to express the goaltype
value of B, but if it did, this phrase should also receive
contrastive accent (e.g., &apos;Twenty minutes later, Over-
mars scored a normal goal&apos;).

that the prediction of contrast does not depend on
the linguistic expressions which are chosen to ex-
press the input data; the data can be expressed in
an indirect way, as in (1)a, without influencing the
prediction of contrast.
The approach sketched above will also give the de-
sired result for example (2): sentence (2)c will not
be regarded as contrastive with (2)b, since (2)c ex-
presses a goal event but (2)b does not.

4 Future directions

<bodyText confidence="0.971741133333333">
An open question which still remains, is at which
level data structures should be compared. In other
words, how do we deal with sub- and supertypes?
For example, apart from the goal_event data type
the GoalGetter system also has a card_event type,
which specifies at what time which player received a
card of which color. Since goal_event and card_event
are different types, they are not expected to be con-
trastible. However, both are subtypes of a more gen-
eral event type, and if regarded at this higher event
level, the structures might be considered as contrast-
ible after all. Examples like (3) seem to suggest that
this is possible.
(3) a In the 11th minute, Ajax took the lead
through a goal by Kluivert.
Shortly after the break, the referee handed
Nilis a yellow card.
Ten minutes later, Kluivert scored for the
second time.
The fact that it is not inappropriate to accent Klu-
ivert in (3)c, shows that (3)c may be regarded as
contrastive to (3)13: otherwise, it would be obligat-
ory to deaccent the second mention of Kluivert due
to givenness, like PSV in (2)c. Cases like this might
be accounted for by assuming that there can be con-
trast between fields that are shared by data types
having the same supertype. In (3), these would be
the player and the minute fields of structures C
and D, shown in Figure 2. This is a tentative solu-
tion which requires further research.

<bodyText confidence="0.905029315789474">
I have sketched a practical approach to the assign-
ment of contrastive accent in data-to-speech sys-
tems, which does not need a universal definition of
alternative or parallel items. Because the determin-
ation of contrast is based on the data expressed by
generated sentences, instead of their syntactic struc-
tures or semantic reprentations, there is no need for
separately encoding world knowledge. The proposed
approach is domain-specific in that it relies heavily
on the data structures that form the input from gen-
eration. On the other hand it is based on a general
principle, which should be applicable in any system
where typed data structures form the input for lin-
guistic generation. In the near future, the proposed
approach will be implemented in GoalGetter.

One of the factors determining accentuation is contrast. Its importance can be illustrated with an example from GoalGetter, a data-to-speech system which generates spoken soccer reports in Dutch (Klabbers et al., 1997). The input of the system is a typed data structure containing data on a soccer match. So-called syntactic templates (van Deemter and Odijk, 1995) are used to express parts of this data structure. In GoalGetter, only &apos;new&apos; information is accented; &apos;given&apos; (&apos;old&apos;) information is not (Chafe, 1976), (Brown, 1983), (Hirschberg, 1992). However, this strategy does not always lead to a correct accentuation pattern if contrastive information is not taken into account, as shown in example (1).1 (1) a In the 16th minute, the Ajax player Kluivert kicked the ball into the wrong goal. b Ten minutes later, Wooter scored for Ajax. 1A11 GoalGetter examples are translated from Dutch.

The word Ajax in (1)b is not accented by the system, because it is mentioned for the second time and therefore regarded as &apos;given&apos;. However, this lack of accent creates the impression that Kluivert scored for Ajax too, whereas in fact he scored for the opposing team through an own goal. This undesirable effect could be avoided by accenting the second occurrence of Ajax in spite of its givenness, to indicate that it constitutes contrastive information. 2 Predicting contrastive accent In this section I discuss two approaches to predicting contrastive accent, which were put forward by Scott Prevost (1995) and Stephen Pulman (1997). In the theory of contrast proposed in (Prevost, 1995), an item receives contrastive accent if it cooccurs with another item that belongs to its &apos;set of alternatives&apos;, i.e. a set of different items of the same type. There are two main problems with this approach. First, as Prevost himself notes, it is very difficult to define exactly which items count as being of &apos;the same type&apos;. If the definition is too strict, not all cases of contrast will be accounted for. On the other hand, if it is too broad, then anything will be predicted to contrast with anything.

This caused Ajax to fall behind. Twenty minutes later Cocu scored for PSV. According to Prevost&apos;s theory, PSV in (2)c should have a contrastive accent, because the two teams Ajax and PSV are obviously in each other&apos;s alternative set. In fact, though, there is no contrast and PSV should be normally deaccented due to givenness. This shows that the presence of an alternative item is not sufficient to trigger contrast accent. 519 Another approach to contrastive accent is advocated by Pulman (1997), who proposes to use higher order unification (HOU) for both interpretation and prediction of focus. Described informally, Pulman&apos;s focus assignment algorithm takes the semantic representation of a sentence which has just been generated, looks in the context for another sentence representation containing parallel items, and abstracts over these items in both representations. If the resulting representations are unifiable, the two sentences stand in a contrast relation and the parallel elements from the most recent one receive a pitch accent (or another focus marker).
