This paper describes a new methodology
for enhancing the quality and relevance of
suggestions provided to users of interac-
tive Q/A systems. We show that by using
Conditional Random Fields to combine
relevance feedback gathered from users
along with information derived from dis-
course structure and coherence, we can
accurately identify irrelevant suggestions
with nearly 90% F-measure.

Today’s interactive question-answering (Q/A) sys-
tems enable users to pose questions in the context
of extended dialogues in order to obtain information
relevant to complex research scenarios. When work-
ing with an interactive Q/A system, users formulate
sequences of questions which they believe will re-
turn answers that will let them reach certain infor-
mation goals.
Users need more than answers, however: while
they might be cognizant of many of the different
types of information that they need, few – if any –
users are capable of identifying all of the questions
that must be asked and answered for a particular sce-
nario. In order to take full advantage of the Q/A
capabilities of current systems, users need access to
sources of domain-specific knowledge that will ex-
pose them to new concepts and ideas and will allow
them to ask better questions.
In previous work (Hickl et al., 2004; Harabagiu et
al., 2005a), we have argued that interactive question-
answering systems should be based on a predictive
dialogue architecture which can be used to provide
users with both precise answers to their questions as
well as suggestions of relevant research topics that
could be explored throughout the course of an inter-
active Q/A dialogue.
Typically, the quality of interactive Q/A dialogues
has been measured in three ways: (1) efficiency, de-
fined as the number of questions that the user must
pose to find particular information, (2) effectiveness,
defined by the relevance of the answer returned, and
(3) user satisfaction (Scholtz and Morse, 2003).
In our experiments with an interactive Q/A sys-
tem, (known as FERRET), we found that perfor-
mance in each of these areas improves as users are
provided with suggestions that are relevant to their
domain of interest. In FERRET, suggestions are
made to users in the form of predictive question-
answer pairs (known as QUABs) which are either
generated automatically from the set of documents
returned for a query (using techniques first described
in (Harabagiu et al., 2005a)), or are selected from a
large database of questions-answer pairs created off-
line (prior to a dialogue) by human annotators.
Figure 1 presents an example of ten QUABs
that were returned by FERRET in response to the
question “How are EU countries responding to the
worldwide increase ofjob outsourcing to India?”.
While FERRET’s QUABs are intended to provide
users with relevant information about a domain of
interest, we can see from Figure 1 that users do not
always agree on which QUAB suggestions are rel-
evant. For example, while someone unfamiliar to
the notion of “job outsourcing” could benefit from

a QUAB like QUAB3: “What is job outsourcing?”,
we expect that a more experienced researcher would
find this definition to be uninformative and poten-
tially irrelevant to his or her particular information
needs. In contrast, a complex QUAB like QUAB6:
“How could the anti-globalization movements in EU
countries impact the likelihood that the EU Parlia-
ment will take steps to prevent job outsourcing to
India?” could provide a domain expert with rel-
evant information, but would not provide enough
background information to satisfy a novice user who
might not be able to interpret this information in the
appropriate context.
In this paper, we present results of a new set of
experiments that seek to combine feedback gathered
from users with a relevance classifier based on con-
ditional random fields (CRF) in order to provide sug-
gestions to users that are not only related to the topic
of their interactive Q/A dialogue, but provide them
with the new types of information they need to know.

of FERRET’s modules and describes the NLP tech-
niques for processing questions as well as the frame-
work for acquiring domain knowledge. In Section 3

of user interaction models for interactive Q/A and

<bodyText confidence="0.999938">
We believe that the quality of interactions produced
by an interactive Q/A system can be enhanced by
predicting the range of questions that a user might
ask while researching a particular topic. By provid-
ing suggestions from a large database of question-
answer pairs related to a user’s particular area of
interest, interactive Q/A systems can help users
gather the information they need most – without the
need for complex, mixed-initiative clarification dia-
logues.
FERRET uses a large collection of QUAB
question-answer pairs in order to provide users with
suggestions of new research topics that could be ex-
plored over the course of a dialogue. For example,
when a user asks a question like What is the result of
the European debate on outsourcing to India? (as il-
lustrated in (Q1) in Table 1), FERRET returns a set of
answers (including (A1) and proposes the questions
in (Q2), (Q3), and (Q4) as suggestions of possible
continuations of the dialogue. Users then have the
freedom to choose how the dialogue should be con-
tinued, either by (1) ignoring the suggestions made
by the system, (2) selecting one of the proposed
QUAB questions and examining its associated an-
swer, or (3) resubmitting the text of the QUAB ques-
tion to FERRET’s automatic Q/A system in order to
retrieve a brand-new set of answers.

(Q1) What is the result of the European debate on outsourcing to India?
(A1) Supporters of economic openness understand how outsourcing can
strengthen the competitiveness of European companies, as well as beneli t
jobs and growth in India.

creased since 1990?

already entered into the discourse, and (3) identifies
a set of basic dialogue acts that are used to manage
the overall course of the interaction with a user.
Output from FERRET’s dialogue shell is sent to
an automatic question-answering system which is
used to find answers to the user’s question(s). FER-
RET uses a version of LCC’s PALANTIR question-
answering system (Harabagiu et al., 2005b) in or-
der to provide answers to questions in documents.
Before being returned to users, answer passages are
submitted to an answer fusion module, which filters
redundant answers and combines answers with com-
patible information content into single coherent an-
swers.
Questions and relational information extracted by
the dialogue shell are also sent to a predictive dia-
logue module, which identifies the QUABs that best
meet the user’s expected information requirements.
At the core of the FERRET’s predictive dialogue
module is the Predictive Dialogue Network (PQN), a
large database of QUABs that were either generated
off-line by human annotators or created on-line by
FERRET (either during the current dialogue or dur-
ing some previous dialogue)&apos;. In order to generate
QUABs automatically, documents identified from
FERRET’s automatic Q/A system are first submit-
ted to a Topic Representation module, which com-
putes both topic signatures (Lin and Hovy, 2000)
and enhanced topic signatures (Harabagiu, 2004) in
order to identify a set of topic-relevant passages.
Passages are then submitted to an Information Ex-
traction module, which annotates texts with a wide

tion, including (1) morphological information, (2)
named entity information from LCC’s CICEROLITE
named entity recognition system, (3) semantic de-
pendencies extracted from LCC’s PropBank-style
semantic parser, and (4) syntactic parse informa-
tion. Passages are then transformed into natural lan-
guage questions using a set of question formation
heuristics; the resultant QUABs are then stored in
the PQN. Since we believe that the same set of re-
lations that hold between questions in a dialogue
should also hold between pairs of individual ques-
tions taken in isolation, discourse relations are dis-
covered between each newly-generated QUAB and
the set of QUABs stored in the PQN. FERRET’s
Question Similarity module then uses the similar-
ity function described in (Harabagiu et al., 2005a) –
along with relational information stored in the PQN
– in order to identify the QUABs that represent the
most informative possible continuations of the dia-
logue. QUABs are then ranked in terms of their rel-
evance to the user’s submitted question and returned
to the user.

In past experiments with users of interactive Q/A
systems (Hickl et al., 2004), we have found that a
user’s access to sources of domain-specific knowl-
edge significantly affects the types of questions that
a user is likely to submit to a Q/A system. Users par-
ticipate in information-seeking dialogues with Q/A
systems in order to learn “new” things – that is, to
acquire information that they do not currently pos-
sess. Users initiate a set of speech acts which allow
them to maximize the amount of new information
they obtain from the system while simultaneously
minimizing the amount of redundant (or previously-
acquired) information they encounter. Our experi-
ments have shown that Q/A systems need to be sen-
sitive to two kinds of users: (1) expert users, who
interact with a system based on a working knowl-
edge of the conceptual structure of a domain, and
(2) novice users, who are presumed to have lim-
ited to no foreknowledge of the concepts associ-
ated with the domain. We have found that novice
users that possess little or no familiarity with a do-
main employ markedly different questioning strate-
gies than expert users who possess extensive knowl-
edge of a domain: while novices focus their atten-
tion in queries that will allow them to discover ba-
sic domain concepts, experts spend their time ask-
ing questions that enable them to evaluate their hy-
potheses in the context of a the currently available
information. The experts tend to ask questions that
refer to the more abstract domain concepts or the
complex relations between concepts. In a similar
fashion, we have discovered that users who have ac-
cess to structured sources of domain-specific knowl-
edge (e.g. knowledge bases, conceptual networks
or ontologies, or mixed-initiative dialogues) can end
up employing more “expert-like” questioning strate-
gies, despite the amount of domain-specific knowl-
edge they possess.
In real-world settings, the knowledge that expert
users possess enables them to formulate a set of hy-
potheses – or belief states – that correspond to each
of their perceived information needs at a given mo-
ment in the dialogue context. As can be seen in the
dialogues presented in Figure 3, expert users gener-
ally formulate questions which seek to validate these
belief states in the context of a document collection.
Given the global information need in 51, it seems
reasonable to presume that questions like EQ1 and
EQ2 are motivated by a user’s expectation that pro-
tectionist policies or public opposition to globaliza-
tion could impact a European Union country’s will-
ingness to take steps to stem job outsourcing to In-
dia. Likewise, questions like EQ5 are designed to
provide the user with information that can decide be-
tween two competing belief states: in this case, the
user wants to know whether the European Union is
more likely to model the United States or Japan in its
policies towards job outsourcing. In contrast, with-
out a pre-existing body of domain-specific knowl-
edge to derive reasonable hypotheses from, novice
users ask questions that enable them to discover
the concepts (and the relations between concepts)
needed to formulate new, more specific hypotheses
and questions. Returning again to Figure 3, we can
see that questions like NQ1 and NQ3 are designed
to discover new knowledge that the user does not
currently possess, while questions like NQ6 try to

establish whether or not the user’s hypothesis (i.e.

consideration.
We have experimented with three models that we
have used to gather feedback from users of FERRET.
The models are illustrated in Figure 4.

4 User Interaction Models for Relevance
Estimation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986005586956522">
Unlike systems that utilize mixed initiative dia-
logues in order to determine a user’s information
needs (Small and Strzalkowski, 2004), systems (like
FERRET) which rely on interactions based on pre-
dictive questioning have traditionally not incorpo-
rated techniques that allow them to gather relevance
feedback from users. In this section, we describe
how we have used a new set of user interaction mod-
els (UIM) in conjunction with a relevance classifier
based on conditional random fields (CRF) (McCal-
lum, 2003; Sha and Pereira, 2003) in order to im-
prove the relevance of the QUAB suggestions that
FERRET returns in response to a user’s query.
We believe that systems based on predictive ques-
tioning can derive feedback from users in three
ways. First, systems can learn which suggestions
or answers are relevant to a user’s domain of inter-
est by tracking which elements users select through-
out the course of a dialogue. With FERRET, each
answer or suggestion presented to a user is associ-
ated with a hyperlink that links to the original text
that the answer or QUAB was derived from. While
users do not always follow links associated with pas-
sages they deem to be relevant to their query, we
expect that the set of selected elements are gener-
ally more likely to be relevant to the user’s interests
than unselected elements. Second, since interactive
Q/A systems are often used to gather information
for inclusion in written reports, systems can identify
relevant content by tracking the text passages that
users copy to other applications, such as text editors
or word processors. Finally, predictive Q/A systems
can gather explicit feedback from users through the
graphical user interface itself. In a recent version of
FERRET, we experimented with adding a “relevance
checkbox” to each answer or QUAB element pre-
sented to a user; users were then asked to provide
feedback to the system by selecting the checkboxes
associated with answers that they deemed to be par-
ticularly relevant to the topic they were researching.
UIM1: Under this model, the set of QUABs that users copied from were selected
as relevant; all QUABs not copied from were annotated as irrelevant.
UIM2: Under this model, QUABs that users viewed were considered to be rele-
vant; QUABs that remained unviewed were annotated as irrelevant.
UIM3: Under this model, QUABs that were either viewed or copied from were
marked as relevant; all other QUABs were annotated as irrelevant.

With FERRET, users are presented with as many
as ten QUABs for every question they submit to the
system. QUABs – whether they be generated auto-
matically by FERRET’s QUAB generation module,
or selected from FERRET’s knowledge base of over
10,000 manually-generated question/answer pairs –
are presented in terms of their conceptual similarity
to the original question. Conceptual similarity (as
first described in (Harabagiu et al., 2005a)) is calcu-
lated using the version of the cosine similarity for-

In the three models from Figure 4, we allowed
users to perform research as they normally would.
Instead of requiring users to provide explicit forms
of feedback, features were derived from the set of
hyper-links that users selected and the text passages
that users copied to the system clipboard.
Following (Kristjansson et al., 2004) we analyzed
the performance of each of these three models using
a new metric derived from the number of relevant
QUABs that were predicted to be returned for each
model. We calculated this metric – which we refer
to as the Expected Number of Irrelevant QUABs –
using the formula:

where pm(n) is equal to the probability of finding
n irrelevant QUABs in a set of 10 suggestions re-
turned to the user given m rounds of interaction.
p0(n) (equation 1) is equal to the probability that all
QUABs are relevant initially, while p1(n) (equation
2) is equal to the probability of finding an irrelevant
QUAB after the set of QUABs has been interacted
with by a user. For the purposes of this paper, we
assumed that all of the QUABs initially returned by
FERRET were relevant, and that p0(0) = 1.0. This
enabled us to calculate p1(n) for each of the three
models provided in Figure 4.

4.2 Relevance Estimation using Conditional
Random Fields
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941703703704">
Following work done by (Kristjansson et al., 2004),
we used the feedback gathered in Section 4.1 to es-
timate the probability that a QUAB selected from
FERRET’S PQN is, in fact, relevant to a user’s orig-
inal query. We assume that humans gauge the rel-
evance of QUAB suggestions returned by the sys-
tem by evaluating the informativeness of the QUAB
with regards to the set of queries and suggestions
that have occurred previously in the discourse. A
QUAB, then, is deemed relevant when it conveys
content that is sufficiently informative to the user,
given what the user knows (i.e. the user’s level of
expertise) and what the user expects to receive as
answers from the system.
Our approach treats a QUAB suggestion
as a single node in a sequence of questions
(Qn−1, Qn, QUAB) and classifies the QUAB as
relevant or irrelevant based on features from the
entire sequence.
We have performed relevance estimation us-
ing Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Given a
random variable x (corresponding to data points
{x1, ... , xn}) and another random variable y (cor-
responding to a set of labels {y1, ... , yn}), CRFs
can be used to calculate the conditional probability
p(y|x). Given a sequence {x1, ... , xn} and set of
labels {y1, ... , yn}, p(y|x) can be defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.95395825">

p(y|x) = z0 exp(n=1

k
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998227">
where z0 is a normalization factor and Ak is a weight
learned for each feature vector fk(yi−1, yi, x, n).
We trained our CRF model in the following way.
If we assume that Λ is a set of feature weights
(A0, ... , Ak), then we expect that we can use maxi-
mum likelihood to estimate values for Λ given a set
of training data pairs (x, y).
Training is accomplished by maximizing the log-
likelihood of each labeled data point as in the fol-
lowing equation:

wΛ = log(pΛ(xi|yi)) (4)

<bodyText confidence="0.9991875">
Again, following (Kristjansson et al., 2004), we
used the CRF Viterbi algorithm to find the most
likely sequence of data points assigned to each la-
bel category using the formula:

Motivated by the types of discourse relations that
appear to exist between states in an interactive Q/A
dialogue, we introduced a large number of features
to estimate relevance for each QUAB suggestion.
The features we used are presented in Figure 6

<figureCaption confidence="0.9645015">
(a) Rank of QUAB: the rank (1, ..., 10) of the QUAB in question.

structure included in QUAB given all QUABs contained in FERRET’s QUAB;
calculated for Arg-0, Arg-1, and ArgM-TMP for each predicate found in

these came from interactions (41 dialogues) where
the user was a self-described “expert” on the topic;
another selection of 500 questions came from a to-
tal of 23 dialogues resulting from interactions with
users who described themselves as “novice” or were
otherwise unfamiliar with a topic. In order to
validate the user’s self-assessment, we selected 5
QUABs at random from the set of manually created
QUABs assembled for each topic. Users were asked
to provide written answers to those questions. Users
that were judged to have correctly answered three
out of five questions were considered “experts” for
the purpose of our experiments. Table 2 presents the
breakdown of questions across these two conditions.

Each of these experiments were run using a ver-
sion of FERRET that returned the top 10 most similar
QUABs from a database that combined manually-
created QUABs with the automatically-generated
QUABs created for the user’s question. While a to-
tal of 10,000 QUABs were returned to users during
these experiments, only 3,998 of these QUABs were
unique (39.98%).
We conducted two kinds of experiments with
users. In the first set of experiments, users were
asked to mark all of the relevant QUABs that FER-
RET returned in response to questions submitted by
users. After performing research on a particular
scenario, expert and novice users were then sup-
plied with as many as 65 questions (and associ-
ated QUABs) taken from previously-completed di-
alogues on the same scenario; users were then asked
to select checkboxes associated with QUABs that
were relevant. In addition, we also had 2 linguists
(who were familiar with all of the research sce-
narios but did not research any of them) perform
the same task for all of the collected questions and
QUABs. Results from these three sets of annotations
are found in Table 3.

As expected, experts believed QUABs to be sig-
nificantly (p &lt; 0.05) less relevant than novices, who
found approximately 38.12% of QUABs to be rel-
evant to the original question submitted by a user.
In contrast, the two linguists found 44.8% of the
QUABs to be relevant. This number may be arti-
ficially high: since the linguists did not engage in
actual Q/A dialogues for each of the scenarios they
were annotating, they may not have been appropri-
ately prepared to make a relevance assessment.
In the second set of experiments, we used the UIM
in Figure 4 to train CRF-based relevance classifiers.
We obtained training data for UIM1 (“copy-and-
paste”-based), UIM2 (“click”-based), and UIM3
(“hybrid”) from 16 different dialogue histories col-
lected from 8 different novice users. During these
dialogues, users were asked to perform research as
they normally would; no special instructions were
given to users to provide additional relevance feed-
back to the system. After the dialogues were com-
pleted, QUABs that were copied from or clicked
were annotated as “relevant” examples (according
to each UIM); the remaining QUABs were anno-
tated as “irrelevant”. Once features (as described
in Table 3) were extracted and the classifiers were
trained, they were evaluated on a set of 1000 QUABs
(500 “relevant”, 500 “irrelevant”) selected at ran-
dom from the annotations performed in the first ex-
periment. Table 4 presents results from these two
classifiers.

Our results suggest that feedback gathered from a
user’s ”normal” interactions with FERRET could be
used to provide valuable input to a relevance classi-
fier for QUABs When “copy-and-paste” events were
used to train the classifier, the system detected in-
stances of irrelevant QUABs with over 80% F. When
the much more frequent “clicking” events were used
to train the classifier, irrelevant QUABs were de-
tected at over 90%F for both UIM2 and UIM3. In
each of these three cases, however, detection of rel-

evant QUABs lagged behind significantly: relevant
QUABs were detected at 42% F in UIM1 at nearly
33% F under UIM2 and at 39% under UIM3.
We feel that these results suggest that the detec-
tion of relevant QUABs (or the filtering of irrelevant
QUABs) may be feasible, even without requiring
users to provide additional forms of explicit feed-
back to the system. While we acknowledge that
training models on these types of events may not al-
ways provide reliable sources of training data – es-
pecially as users copy or click on QUAB passages
that may not be relevant to their interests in the re-
search scenario, we believe the initial performance
of these suggests that accurate forms of relevance
feedback can be gathered without the use of mixed-
initiative clarification dialogues.

In this paper, we have presented a methodology that
combines feedback that was gathered from users in
conjunction with a CRF-based classifier in order to
enhance the quality of suggestions returned to users
of interactive Q/A systems. We have shown that
the irrelevant QUAB suggestions can be identified at
over 90% when systems combine information from
a user’s interaction with semantic and pragmatic fea-
tures derived from the structure and coherence of an
interactive Q/A dialogue.

NQ6 − Do European Union Countries view job outsourcing to countries like India as a problem? NQ3 − What industries have been most active in outsourcing jobs to India? they are looking for. In past experiments with users of interactive Q/A systems (Hickl et al., 2004), we have found that a user’s access to sources of domain-specific knowledge significantly affects the types of questions that a user is likely to submit to a Q/A system. Users participate in information-seeking dialogues with Q/A systems in order to learn “new” things – that is, to acquire information that they do not currently possess. Users initiate a set of speech acts which allow them to maximize the amount of new information they obtain from the system while simultaneously minimizing the amount of redundant (or previouslyacquired) information they encounter.

In the three models from Figure 4, we allowed users to perform research as they normally would. Instead of requiring users to provide explicit forms of feedback, features were derived from the set of hyper-links that users selected and the text passages that users copied to the system clipboard. Following (Kristjansson et al., 2004) we analyzed the performance of each of these three models using a new metric derived from the number of relevant QUABs that were predicted to be returned for each model. We calculated this metric – which we refer to as the Expected Number of Irrelevant QUABs – using the formula: 1 0 p0(n) = E kp0(k) (1) k=1 1 0 p1(n) = (1 − p0(0)) + E kp1(k) (2) k=1 29 where pm(n) is equal to the probability of finding n irrelevant QUABs in a set of 10 suggestions returned to the user given m rounds of interaction. p0(n) (equation 1) is equal to the probability that all QUABs are relevant initially, while p1(</context>

We trained our CRF model in the following way. If we assume that Λ is a set of feature weights (A0, ... , Ak), then we expect that we can use maximum likelihood to estimate values for Λ given a set of training data pairs (x, y). Training is accomplished by maximizing the loglikelihood of each labeled data point as in the following equation: N wΛ = log(pΛ(xi|yi)) (4) i=1 Again, following (Kristjansson et al., 2004), we used the CRF Viterbi algorithm to find the most likely sequence of data points assigned to each label category using the formula: pΛ(y|x) (5) Motivated by the types of discourse relations that appear to exist between states in an interactive Q/A dialogue, we introduced a large number of features to estimate relevance for each QUAB suggestion.

Typically, the quality of interactive Q/A dialogues has been measured in three ways: (1) efficiency, defined as the number of questions that the user must pose to find particular information, (2) effectiveness, defined by the relevance of the answer returned, and (3) user satisfaction (Scholtz and Morse, 2003). In our experiments with an interactive Q/A system, (known as FERRET), we found that performance in each of these areas improves as users are provided with suggestions that are relevant to their domain of interest. In FERRET, suggestions are made to users in the form of predictive questionanswer pairs (known as QUABs) which are either generated automatically from the set of documents returned for a query (using techniques first described in (Harabagiu et al., 2005a)), or are selected from a large database of questions-answer pairs created offline (prior to a dialogue) by human annotators.
