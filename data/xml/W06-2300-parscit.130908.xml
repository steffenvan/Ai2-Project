<bodyText confidence="0.996373905660377">
Robustness is a fuzzy notion, which accordingly is difficult to define. This difficulty mainly
arises from the fact that robustness touches upon the highly subjective and application-
specific notion of the norm and the deviation thereof. Thus, robustness is inherently about the
unexpected, about all the things that can and will go wrong, which have not been taken care of
and which usually cannot be fully anticipated.
On the other hand, robustness is one of the most prominent characteristics of intelligent
human behaviour which facilitates flexible and sensible responses to a wide variety of
unpredictable situations. A closer look at the phenomenon reveals a multitude of different
aspects. Thus merely speaking about robustness requires to identify precisely against which
particular kind of deviation robust behaviour is desired, a question which is highly dependent
on the application and the task at hand.
The contributions to this workshop deal with issues of robustness in quite different areas of
Natural Language Processing, ranging from anaphora resolution on the one hand to three
different sentence analysis tasks on the other.
Delmonte et al. compare their system for anaphora resolution against three other systems from
the literature and show that it outperforms the other approaches significantly. They attribute
this success to the use of a robust parser, which is able to determine surface and deep
syntactic relationships robustly.
Semantically annotated structures are in the focus of Musillo and Merlo&apos;s paper. They
modified a statistical parsing model to also assign semantic role labels as annotated in the
Prop bank. The solution differs from other approaches in that it integrates both labeling tasks
into a single processing step. The results show that despite a 20-fold increase in non-terminals
a fairly high f-measure of 82\% was obtained. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of as
little as 6\% compared to the baseline system, which only considers purely syntactic
categories. Musillo and Merlo interpret this as evidence for the robustness of the underlying
stochastic model (Simple Synchrony Network), which does not require making specific
assumptions about parameter independence.
Philippe Blache applies Property Grammar, a constraint-based formalism for phrase structure
descriptions, to shallow parsing of French sentences. Robustness in this case is achieved by
relaxing constraints if necessary.
Finally, Foth and Menzel investigate the relationship between coverage and accuracy when
parsing unrestricted German text. Their results confirm that even for a grammar which is able
to determine the optimal structure according to some given criterion, there is a reciprocal
correspondence: reducing the coverage by removing rare phenomena from the grammar
slightly increased the accuracy of the parser. They claim that this finding provides support to
the hypothesis that robustness, which in this case in introduced by means of weighted
constraints, might be a more desirable property than coverage as long as really rare
phenomena are considered.
With this selection the workshop unites samples of different techniques for achieving
robustness for a range of different processing task. This, however, leaves completely
i
untouched the problem of measuring robustness properties as such. If robustness is defined as
a smooth degradation in the performance of a system when faced with unexpected input,
common evaluation procedures where test and training data are obtained from the same
source, do not contribute very much to a deeper understanding of what robustness really
means and how it can be achieved best.
Talking about robustness as the ability to deal with deviation from the norm naturally includes
issues like scalability and portability. It therefore remains a challenge for future research to
develop proposals for standardized scenarios in which such properties can be evaluated across
a wide variety of languages and processing tasks. In this sense this workshop is a small
contribution of an ongoing effort towards a common research goal, which step by step might
become less elusive: How to make natural language processing systems more stable, more
dependable, more useful, ...in short, more human like.
