Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9973928">
In this paper we explore the possibilities
that conversational agent technology offers
for the improvement of the quality of hu-
man-machine interaction in a concrete area
of application: the multimodal biometric
authentication system. Our approach looks
at the user perception effects related to the
system interface rather than to the perform-
ance of the biometric technology itself. For
this purpose we have created a multibio-
metric user test environment with two dif-
ferent interfaces or interaction metaphors:
one with an embodied conversational agent
and the other with on-screen text messages
only. We present the results of an explora-
tory experiment that reveals interesting ef-
fects, related to the presence of a conversa-
tional agent, on the user&apos;s perception of pa-
rameters such as privacy, ease of use, inva-
siveness or system security.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.993996488372093">
The term biometrics, in Information Technology,
refers to an array of techniques to identify people
based on one or more unique behavioural or
physiological characteristics. The techniques them-
selves have improved considerably over the past
few decades, in terms of performance
and reliability, with reported error rates at levels
that indicate a reasonable level of technological
maturity (Wayman et al., 2005). But in order to be
truly useful the technology has to be acceptable to
people in each of its areas of application. It is
widely recognised (BioSec, 2004) that to achieve
this goal a user-centred understanding much deeper
than that which we have today is needed, and one
which encompasses the important problem of in-
teraction with the interface. These, of course, are
basic goals of the more general field of Human-
Computer Interaction, added to which are more
specific issues regarding security (Sasse, 2004).
As regards application interface technology,
ever more realistic animated characters or embod-
ied conversational agents (ECAs) are being gradu-
ally introduced in the hope that they will enhance
the users&apos; experience and enrich the interaction.
Some applications of ECAs promise to bring us
closer to achieving universal usability. For in-
stance, they can be used to communicate with
hearing impaired people through sign language
(Huenerfauth, 2005) or lip-reading (Beskow et al.,
2004). Furthermore, language and the appearance,
style, gesture repertoire and attitude of the charac-
ter can be tuned to each application&apos;s context, to
user preferences, and more importantly to take into
account cultural particularities.
The effects of animated characters on users and
on the dynamics of user-system interaction are still
unclear, as is the question of how to use them in
order to maximize the benefits desired. However,
the literature does report significant improvements
in users&apos; perception of the system and their interac-
tion with it when the interface includes an ani-
mated character (Moundridou and Virvou, 2001;
Mori et al., 2003; Van Mulken et al., 199 8).

In what way and to what extent are the percep-
tions of users affected by the presence of an ani-
mated character in the system interface? And how
does this affect users&apos; opinion and acceptance of a
biometric authentication system? We designed an
experiment to learn a bit more about these impor-
tant usability questions. Expanding on previous
studies of factors that impact on the usability of a
biometric authentication system, the present paper
reports the differences we have found in the sub-
jective perceptions of users interacting with our
biometric authentication system through interfaces
offering two different forms of assistance: informa-
tion and assistance in the form of text shown on-
screen, and given by a talking animated character.
In the following section we review a variety of
social and user perception parameters identified in
the literature as being potentially affected by an
ECA. In section 3 we describe our user test frame-
work and we show our results in section 4.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999871285714286">
According to Nass et al. (1994) human—machine
interaction is fundamentally social. This has clear
implications for user interface design. The user&apos;s
view of how the system works doesn&apos;t always cor-
respond to the actual way the technology works,
but, rather, it depends on the user&apos;s preconceptions,
on the interaction process itself and on mental
models that are influenced by the system interface.
Introducing an ECA in the interface can have a
visual impact on the user that can affect her per-
ception of the system as a whole. Ruttkay et al.
(2002) compile a number of user parameters (such
as trust, ease of use, effectiveness, and personal
taste) that have been shown in the literature to be
affected by the presence of an ECA.
Basically, there are two lines of work related to
the effects of ECAs on the users&apos; perception of a
system. On one hand, the so called &amp;quot;persona ef-
fect,&amp;quot; associated with the presence of the ECA, and
on the other, effects connected with the character-
istics or qualities a specific ECA might have.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993693">
2.1 The persona effect
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959595744681">
People seem to like and enjoy using systems with
ECAs more than without them, they tend to find
systems easier to use and tasks easier to accom-
plish, and they also feel more motivated and find
learning easier (both learning to use the system and
learning about a particular subject in the case of
teaching applications), even though their perform-
ance is in fact roughly the same as that of users
interacting without the ECA: Some authors specu-
late that objective performance improvements be-
yond user perceptions will be achieved in the long-
run. For instance, Moundridou and Virvou (2001)
believe that the increased motivation of students
using a tutor application with an animated charac-
ter may enhance their learning capacity in the long-
term.
Animated characters can even help contain user
stress and frustration caused by difficulties during
interaction with the system (Mori et al., 2003), and
as a result they may improve the efficiency of the
interaction over that of a text-only system (Hone et
al., 2003). An interesting point is that many of
these psychological effects are observed as a re-
sponse to the mere presence of the animated char-
acter, without it providing any obvious cues or ex-
pression to help the user: people&apos;s perceptions
have also been found to be affected by an ECA&apos;s
behaviour. The phenomenon has been called `Per-
sona Effect&apos; (Lester et al., 1997). Later research
(Van Mulken et al., 199 8) has shown that the mere
presence of an ECA can make tasks seem easier
and more enjoyable to the user. Furthermore, an
ECA showing greater empathic emotion towards
the user improves the latter&apos;s overall impression of
the system and perception of ease of use (Brave et
al., 2005; Mori et al., 2003).
The presence of a human-like character can also
have potential dangers such as the system anthro-
pomorphisation effect that may lead to users hav-
ing unrealistic expectations that are frustrated by
actual interaction, as Walker et al. (1994) points
out, concluding that a human face in an interface
can help attract the user&apos;s attention and increase
her level of motivation. At the same time, how-
ever, it can create high expectations about the in-
telligence of the system, which can lead to frustra-
tion if they are then not met.

2.2 ECA feature-related effects
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967428571429">
Some authors have studied how the attitude dis-
played by the ECA, for instance regarding its pro-
activity and reactivity (Xiao et. al, 2004), may in-
duce in the user certain responses such as a sense
of ease of use, system usefulness, frustration or
sluggishness in task execution. Indeed, it has been
shown that an affective and empathic attitude on
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970333333333">
the part of the ECA can have a very positive effect
on the user&apos;s perception of the interaction, lower-
ing the level of frustration (Hone et al., 2003; Mori
et al., 2003) and improving the user&apos;s opinion of
the system (Brave et. al 2005).
Another line of research deals with the gestures
and nonverbal behaviour of the ECA. A good ges-
tural repertoire may promote in the user a percep-
tion of naturalness of interaction with the system
and system socialness (see, e.g., Cassell and Bick-
more, 2000).
The physical appearance of the ECA has also
been seen to have an influence on the user. For
instance, Leenheer (2006) has studied the effect of
the colour of the clothing on the ECA, and Hone
(2006) shows that a female character reduces user
frustration levels better than a male one. Hone also
points out that the actual efficiency of the interac-
tion may depend on the ECAs characteristics.
Dehn and Van Mulken (2000) suggest that the
great variability of results in the literature may be
due not only to the different features of the ECAs
across the studies, but also to the different areas of
application in which the ECAs were used. In this
paper we present a study of the influence of an
ECA in a specific application domain: biometric
authentication. First we identify the user percep-
tion parameters that we have considered may be
affected by the ECA. Then we describe our ex-
ploratory test to examine the persona effect. We
have left the observation of the effects of the
physical, attitudinal and gestural features of the
ECA for future experiments.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983111111111">
We created a multibiometric authentication test
platform with two user interfaces, one with an
ECA guiding the user through the steps of the re-
quired tasks, the other with the same information
provided only through text displayed on the screen.
We asked the users to carry out two general tasks:
a) to try to access the system acting as impostors,
and b) to enrol using their own biometric traits and
then authenticate their real identity.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999452">

<bodyText confidence="0.999942307692308">
The test platform architecture simulates a scenario
in which a user has to securely access restricted
information stored on a remote server across an IP
network (Internet or Intranet). In order to access
such information the user&apos;s identity must be au-
thenticated on the basis of two biometric traits
(hence our characterisation of the system as multi-
biometric). The user may choose the two modes
she wishes to authenticate her identity with from
among the following four: fingerprint, signature,
voice and iris pattern.
The specific technologies used for each biomet-
ric mode were:

We have created a web interface (using Java App-
let technology) with five flaps; one to access the
general instructions of use, and one for each of the
four biometric modes (in left to right order: finger-
print, signature, voice and iris). Below is a biomet-
ric trait visualisation area and a text message bar
through which (in addition to the ECA) the system
guides the user throughout the interaction.
In addition, we divided the test users into two
groups to which we presented two different inter-
action &amp;quot;metaphors&amp;quot;:

and integrated into our application using the
technology provided by Haptek (Haptek,

3.3 Description of the tests
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996428896551724">
We designed the tests following the recommenda-
tions issued by the International Biometric Group
(IBG, 2006). We worked with a sample of 20 us-
ers, half of which interacted with the ECA meta-
phor and the other half with the TEXT metaphor.
The users carried out the following tasks distrib-
uted in two separate sessions (on different days):
• On the first day an experimenter trained
each participant in the use of each biometric
mode. The training is specific for each mode
and results in the creation of a biometric
trait pattern for each user. After creating the
user models the impostor tests were carried
out. We allowed the users to consult the
biometric traits (i.e., fingerprint, signature,
voice sample and picture of the iris) of four
people (2 females and 2 males), and we
asked them to choose one of them in each of
five impersonation attempts. In order to ac-
cess the system (in this case as impostors)
users had to successfully mimic any two
biometric traits of the same person. The sys-
tem returned the result of the attempt (suc-
cess or failure) at the end of the verification
process. After taking all of the 5 attempts
the users were directed to a web question-
naire to rate the ease of use, sense of secu-
rity and preference of each of the biometric
modes, and to give an overall score for the
system.
• The second day the users were asked to au-
thenticate their own identity. The task was
to successfully access the system three times
in a maximum of 6 attempts. Just as in the
impostor attempts, users had to enter two of
their biometric traits in succession, after
which they were informed of the system&apos;s
decision to accept or reject them. In case of
failure in either of the two chosen modes,
the system didn&apos;t inform the users of which
mode failed. At the end of this second ses-
sion the users completed another web ques-
tionnaire to give us their evaluation of sys-
tem privacy and an overall score of merit for
the system, and for each biometric mode
they rated pleasantness, ease of use and
preference. In addition, those users who in-
teracted with the ECA metaphor were asked
to rate the usefulness and pleasantness of the
ECA.
In addition to the questionnaire information we
collected user-system interaction efficiency data
such as number of failures, verification times and
so on. However, in this paper we focus primarily
on the users&apos; impressions. To summarise, the pa-
rameters we have analysed are Preference, Secu-
rity, Ease-of-use, Pleasantness and Privacy, all
measured on 7-point Likert scales.

We carried out a series of two sample t-tests on the
two groups of users (ECA Metaphor and TEXT
Metaphor) and examined the influence of the ECA
on the subjective parameters of the interaction. For
each of the tests we propose a null hypothesis, Ho,
and an alternative hypothesis, H1. We have chosen
the 5% (p=0.05) significance level to reject the null
hypothesis. (The questionnaire values were nor-
malised to values between —3 and 3 for statistical
processing.)

Our general working hypothesis is that interaction
with the ECA interface will be more pleasant for
the user, which will result in a higher opinion of
the system. We specify this in a series of hypothe-
ses for each of the perception parameters we intro-
duced in the previous section:

H1: ECA Metaphor users rate the ease-of-use of
the biometric modes significantly higher than
TEXT Metaphor users.
The average ease-of-use score for the ECA
Metaphor is: µECA = 1,30; and for the TEXT Meta-
phor: gTEXT = 0.65. The two sample t-test showed
that the difference was statistically significant
(t(74)=1.94; p=0.02 8). Therefore we may accept
the alternative hypothesis that the ECA increases
the user&apos;s perception of ease-of-use of biometric

The average pleasantness score for the ECA

in this case the alternative hypothesis that users&apos;
perception of privacy is lower with the ECA Meta-
phor than with the TEXT Metaphor. This result
might lend support to Zajonc&apos;s (1965) suggestion
that the presence of a character may enhance

why the user might feel uneasy letting the agent

The objective parameter categories compared
were speed (verification times and reaction times)
and efficiency (number of verification failures,
false matches and false rejections). We found no

The fact that our system is multibiometric —in
that it requires simultaneous verification of two

the complexity of the verification process (Ubuek,

of the TEXT Metaphor users.
The average score for the perceived need for the
enhanced security provided by multibiometrics is,
for the ECA Metaphor: µECA= 2. 8; and for the
TEXT Metaphor: µTEXT=2.1. The two sample t-test
showed that the difference was statistically signifi-

confirm the alternative hypothesis.
We found no statistically significant differences
between the two metaphors regarding the users&apos;

5 Conclusions and future lines of re-
search
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942551724138">
Some of the most serious obstacles to widespread
use that biometic technology is facing are related
to user interaction and acceptance. We believe the
results presented in this paper open interesting new
lines of research. We found that the presence of an
ECA (persona effect) makes users experience in-
teraction as easier and more pleasant. Regarding
sense of security, our results are in line with other
studies on ECAs. The increased pleasantness of
use of the biometric modes could help overcome
users&apos; reluctance to accept biometric systems. On
the other hand, the presence of the ECA could have
a negative affect by enhancing the users&apos; percep-
tion of encroachment on their privacy.
We believe it may be possible to increase the
level of users&apos; perceived privacy and user trust by
adopting strategies such as allowing the user to
personalise the appearance and even the behaviour
of the avatar, as Xiao et al. (2007) suggest. Giving
the ECA greater and more natural communication
skills (e.g., small talk, specific gestures, etc.) and a
more empathic attitude (in line with ideas in the
area of affective computing) could have further
positive effects.
We may mention the inclusion of ECAs on mul-
tibiometric systems as another interesting specific
line of research, given the enhancement in the us-
ers&apos; perception of the security of such systems
compared to the same without ECA.

<abstract confidence="0.998385">In this paper we explore the possibilities that conversational agent technology offers for the improvement of the quality of human-machine interaction in a concrete area of application: the multimodal biometric authentication system. Our approach looks at the user perception effects related to the system interface rather than to the performance of the biometric technology itself. For this purpose we have created a multibiometric user test environment with two different interfaces or interaction metaphors: one with an embodied conversational agent and the other with on-screen text messages only. We present the results of an exploratory experiment that reveals interesting effects, related to the presence of a conversational agent, on the user&apos;s perception of parameters such as privacy, ease of use, invasiveness or system security.</abstract>

The phenomenon has been called `Persona Effect&apos; (Lester et al., 1997). Later research (Van Mulken et al., 199 8) has shown that the mere presence of an ECA can make tasks seem easier and more enjoyable to the user. Furthermore, an ECA showing greater empathic emotion towards the user improves the latter&apos;s overall impression of the system and perception of ease of use (Brave et al., 2005; Mori et al., 2003). The presence of a human-like character can also have potential dangers such as the system anthropomorphisation effect that may lead to users having unrealistic expectations that are frustrated by actual interaction, as Walker et al. (1994) points out, concluding that a human face in an interface can help attract the user&apos;s attention and increase her level of motivation. At the same time, however, it can create high expectations about the intelligence of the system, which can lead to frustration if they are then not met. 2.2 ECA feature-related effects Some authors have st</context>

Indeed, it has been shown that an affective and empathic attitude on 34 the part of the ECA can have a very positive effect on the user&apos;s perception of the interaction, lowering the level of frustration (Hone et al., 2003; Mori et al., 2003) and improving the user&apos;s opinion of the system (Brave et. al 2005). Another line of research deals with the gestures and nonverbal behaviour of the ECA. A good gestural repertoire may promote in the user a perception of naturalness of interaction with the system and system socialness (see, e.g., Cassell and Bickmore, 2000). The physical appearance of the ECA has also been seen to have an influence on the user. For instance, Leenheer (2006) has studied the effect of the colour of the clothing on the ECA, and Hone (2006) shows that a female character reduces user frustration levels better than a male one. Hone also points out that the actual efficiency of the interaction may depend on the ECAs characteristics. Dehn and Van Mulken (2000) suggest that the great variability of results in the literature may be due not only to the different features of the ECAs across the studies, but also to the different areas of ap</context>

The ECA gives no information regarding the details of each particular biometric mode. The ECA has been created and integrated into our application using the technology provided by Haptek (Haptek, 2007). The ECA uses free Spanish Text-ToSpeech (TTS) software (Lernout and Haus35 pie, 2007) to speak to the user. Figure 1 shows the interface with the ECA. • TEXT Metaphor: The user is only guided through text messages. Note: In the ECA metaphor the text message bar remains active, serving as subtitles to what the ECA says.

For instance, Moundridou and Virvou (2001) believe that the increased motivation of students using a tutor application with an animated character may enhance their learning capacity in the longterm. Animated characters can even help contain user stress and frustration caused by difficulties during interaction with the system (Mori et al., 2003), and as a result they may improve the efficiency of the interaction over that of a text-only system (Hone et al., 2003). An interesting point is that many of these psychological effects are observed as a response to the mere presence of the animated character, without it providing any obvious cues or expression to help the user: people&apos;s perceptions have also been found to be affected by an ECA&apos;s behaviour.

Indeed, it has been shown that an affective and empathic attitude on 34 the part of the ECA can have a very positive effect on the user&apos;s perception of the interaction, lowering the level of frustration (Hone et al., 2003; Mori et al., 2003) and improving the user&apos;s opinion of the system (Brave et. al 2005).

Another line of research deals with the gestures and nonverbal behaviour of the ECA. A good gestural repertoire may promote in the user a perception of naturalness of interaction with the system and system socialness (see, e.g., Cassell and Bickmore, 2000). The physical appearance of the ECA has also been seen to have an influence on the user. For instance, Leenheer (2006) has studied the effect of the colour of the clothing on the ECA, and Hone (2006) shows that a female character reduces user frustration levels better than a male one. Hone also points out that the actual efficiency of the interaction may depend on the ECAs characteristics. Dehn and Van Mulken (2000) suggest that the great variability of results in the literature may be due not only to the different features of the ECAs across the studies, but also to the different areas of application in which the ECAs were used. In this paper we present a study of the influence of an ECA in a specific applic</context>

An interesting point is that many of these psychological effects are observed as a response to the mere presence of the animated character, without it providing any obvious cues or expression to help the user: people&apos;s perceptions have also been found to be affected by an ECA&apos;s behaviour. The phenomenon has been called `Persona Effect&apos; (Lester et al., 1997). Later research (Van Mulken et al., 199 8) has shown that the mere presence of an ECA can make tasks seem easier and more enjoyable to the user. Furthermore, an ECA showing greater empathic emotion towards the user improves the latter&apos;s overall impression of the system and perception of ease of use (Brave et al., 2005; Mori et al., 2003). The presence of a human-like character can also have potential dangers such as the system anthropomorphisation effect that may lead to users having unrealistic expectations that are frustrated by actual interaction, as Walker et al.

The effects of animated characters on users and on the dynamics of user-system interaction are still unclear, as is the question of how to use them in order to maximize the benefits desired. However, the literature does report significant improvements in users&apos; perception of the system and their interaction with it when the interface includes an animated character (Moundridou and Virvou, 2001; Mori et al., 2003; Van Mulken et al., 199 8). 33 Proceedings of the Workshop on Embodied Language Processing, pages 33–40, Prague, Czech Republic, June 28, 2007. c�2007 Association for Computational Linguistics In what way and to what extent are the perceptions of users affected by the presence of an animated character in the system interface?

For instance, Moundridou and Virvou (2001) believe that the increased motivation of students using a tutor application with an animated character may enhance their learning capacity in the longterm.

The techniques themselves have improved considerably over the past few decades, in terms of performance and reliability, with reported error rates at levels that indicate a reasonable level of technological maturity (Wayman et al., 2005).

Regarding sense of security, our results are in line with other studies on ECAs. The increased pleasantness of use of the biometric modes could help overcome users&apos; reluctance to accept biometric systems. On the other hand, the presence of the ECA could have a negative affect by enhancing the users&apos; perception of encroachment on their privacy. We believe it may be possible to increase the level of users&apos; perceived privacy and user trust by adopting strategies such as allowing the user to personalise the appearance and even the behaviour of the avatar, as Xiao et al. (2007) suggest. Giving the ECA greater and more natural communication skills (e.g., small talk, specific gestures, etc.) and a more empathic attitude (in line with ideas in the area of affective computing) could have further positive effects. We may mention the inclusion of ECAs on multibiometric systems as another interesting specific line of research, given the enhancement in the users&apos; perception of the security of such systems compared to the same without ECA. 6 Acknowledgements This study has been possible thanks to the support grant received from the TEC2006-13170-C02-02 project of the Spanish</context>
