PREFACE
</note>
<bodyText confidence="0.986052371428571">
Computational Terminology is becoming an increasingly important aspect in areas such as text
mining, information retrieval, information extraction, summarisation, document management
systems, question-answering systems, ontology building, etc. In text mining, the acquisition
of new knowledge is best captured through terms as they denote new concepts. Terminolog-
ical information is paramount for knowledge mining from texts for scientific discovery and
competitive intelligence. Currently, scientific needs especially in fast growing domains, such
as biomedicine, and the overwhelming amount of textual data published daily, demand that
terminology is acquired and managed systematically and automatically.
The aim of this third CompuTerm workshop is to bring together Natural Language Processing
researchers to discuss recent advances in computational terminology and its impact in many
NLP applications. Topics such as term extraction, constructing and updating domain specific
dictionaries and thesauri, and systematic terminology management are addressed as they are
a necessary component of any NLP system dealing with domain-specific literature.
The topics addressed in this workshop are wide ranging: from term extraction in various lan-
guages using different techniques (verb co-occurrence, information theoretic approaches, etc),
extracting translation pairs from bilingual corpora based on terminology, to semantic oriented
approaches and theoretical aspects of terminology. Terminology structuring is also becom-
ing an important research topic as the detection of semantic relationships between terms finds
applications such as the population and update of existing knowledge bases, definition of do-
main specific templates in Information Extraction, disambiguation of terms, etc. The discovery
of synonym terms or term clusters is equally beneficial to many applications in information
retrieval, thesaurus generation, information extraction, question-answering ,etc. The integra-
tion of different terminological resources is also increasingly important as one has to address
term variation between controlled vocabularies, thesauri and textual data. Terminology has
to deal with the dynamic nature of terms, their variability, their acquisition from heteroge-
neous sources, their integration, standardisation and representation. Research and competition
tracks on the evaluation of terminological tools still lag behind in terminology in comparison to
other NLP areas. With the exception of the NTCIR-1 TMREC, dedicated competition tracks like
MUC, TREC, for the evaluation of terminological management systems, term extraction tools,
are still missing. Recently, evaluation in specialised areas e.g. named entity recognition in
Biomedicine (BioCreative) proved very successful in identifying key problems in terminology
such as term variation and ambiguity.
We would like to thank the authors for submitting their research and the members of the Pro-
gramme Committee for their reviews and useful suggestions to the authors.
