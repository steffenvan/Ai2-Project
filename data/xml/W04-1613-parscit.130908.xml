Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999974238095238">
Urdu is spoken by more than 100 million
people across a score countries and is the
national language of Pakistan (http://www.
ethnologue.com). There is a great need for
developing a text-to-speech system for Urdu
because this population has low literacy rate
and therefore speech interface would greatly
assist in providing them access to information.
One of the significant parts of a text-to-speech
system is a natural language processor which
takes textual input and converts it into an
annotated phonetic string. To enable this, it is
necessary to develop models which map
textual input onto phonetic content. These
models may be very complex for various
languages having unpredictable behaviour
(e.g. English), but Urdu shows a relatively
regular behaviour and thus Urdu pronunciation
may be modelled from Urdu text by defining
fairly regular rules. These rules have been
identified and explained in this paper.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999445722222222">
Text-to-speech synthesis is logically divided into
two stages. The first stage takes raw text input,
processes it and converts it into precise phonetic
string to be spoken, appropriately annotated with
prosodic markers (e.g. stress and intonation). The
second stage takes this phonetic representation of
speech and generates the appropriate digital signal
using a particular synthesis technique. These
stages may be referred to as Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and Speech Synthesis (SS)
respectively (e.g. Dutoit 1997, p.14).
For SS, formant based techniques (e.g. Klatt
1980) or diphone based techniques (e.g. Dutoit
1997) are normally employed and are generally
script independent (as they are only dependent on
temporal and spectral acoustic properties of the
language and take input in script-neutral form, e.g.
in IPA). However, NLP is very dependent on
cultural and linguistic specific usage of script.
NLP may also be divided into further parts. The
first component is dedicated to pre-processing,
‘cleaning’ and normalizing input text. Once the
input text is normalized, the second component
does phonological processing to generate a more
precise phonetic string to be spoken. One of the
first tasks in the Phonological Processing
Component is to convert the input text into a
phonemic string using Letter-to-Sound (LTS)
rules. This string is then eventually converted to
precise phonetic transcription after application of
sound change rules and other annotations, as
explained later. This paper overviews Urdu
writing system, phonemic inventory, NLP for TTS
and gives details of the LTS rules for Urdu (also
see Rafique et at. (2001) and Hussain (1997:
Appendix A), for introductory work).

2 Urdu Writing System and Phonemic
Inventory
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938666666667">
Urdu is written in Arabic script in Nastaleeq
style using an extended Arabic character set.
Nastaleeq is a cursive, context-sensitive and highly
complex writing system (Hussain 2003). The
character set includes basic and secondary letters,
aerab (or diacritical marks), punctuation marks and
special symbols (Hussain and Afzal 2001, Afzal
and Hussain 2001). Urdu is normally written with
only the letters. However, the letters represent just
the consonantal content of the string and in some
cases (under-specified) vocalic content. The
vocalic content can be (optionally) completely
specified by using the aerab with the letters. Aerab
are normally not written and are assumed to be
known by the native speaker, thus making it very
hard for a foreigner to read. Certain aerab are also
used to specify additional consonants. Urdu letters
and aerab are given in Table 1 below.

Combination of these characters realizes a rich
inventory of 44 consonants, 8 long oral vowels, 7
long nasal vowels, 3 short vowels and numerous
diphthongs (e.g. Saleem et al. 2002, Hussain 1997;
set of Urdu diphthongs is still under analysis).
This phonemic inventory is given in Table 2.
The italicized phonemes, whose existence is still
not determined, are not considered any further (see
Saleem et al. 2002 for further discussion).
Mapping of this phonetic inventory to the
characters given in Table 1 is discussed later.

3 NLP for Urdu TTS

<bodyText confidence="0.9883426">
As discussed earlier, to enable text-to-speech
system for any language, a Natural Language
Processing component is required. The NLP
system may have differing requirement for
different languages. However, it always takes raw
text input and always outputs precise phonetic
transcription for a language. The system can be
divided into two parts, Text-Normalization
Component and Phonological Processing
Component. These components may be further

The Text Normalization component takes a
character string as input and converts it into a
string of letters. Within it, the Tokenizer uses the
punctuation marks and space between words to
mark token boundaries which are then stamped as
words, punctuation, date, time and other relevant
categories by the Semantic Tagger. The String
Generator takes any non-letter based input (e.g. a
number or a date containing digits) and converts it
into a letter string.
After the input is converted into a string
comprising only of letters, the Phonological
Processing Component generates the
corresponding phonetic transcription. This is done
through a series of processes. The first process is
to use Letter-to-Sound Converter (detailed below)
to convert the normalized text input to a phonemic
string. This process may also be referred to as
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. This is
followed by Syllabifier, which marks syllable
boundaries. The intermediate output is then
forwarded to a module which applies Urdu sound
change rules to generate the corresponding
phonetic string. Following these modules, Stress
Marker and Intonation Marker modules add stress
and intonation to the string being processed. Re-
syllabification is also performed after sound
change rules are applied, in case phones are
epenthesized or deleted and syllable boundaries
require re-adjustment. Urdu shows a reasonably
regular behavior and most of these tasks can be
achieved through rule-based systems (e.g. see
Hussain 1997 for stress assignment algorithm).
This paper focuses on Letter-to-Sound rules for
Urdu, the first in the series of modules in
Phonological Processing Component.

4 Urdu Letter to Sound Rules
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99961975">
Urdu shows a very regular mapping from
graphemes to phonemes. However, to explain the
behavior, the letters need to be further classified
into the following categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.938087833333333">
a. Consonantal characters
b. Dual (consonantal and vocalic) behavior
characters
c. Vowel modifier character
d. Consonant modifier character
e. Composite (consonantal and vocalic) character
Similarly, the aerab set can also be divided into
the following categories:
f. Basic vowel specifier
g. Extended vowel specifier
h. Consonantal gemination specifier
i. Dual (vocalic and consonantal) insertor
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.961431142857143">
Finally, there is a third category which may take
shape of an letter and aerab:
j. Vowel-aerab placeholder
The Consonantal characters in (a) above always
represent a consonant of Urdu. In Urdu, there is
always a single consonant corresponding to a
single character of this category, unlike some other
languages e.g. English maps “ph” string to
phoneme /f/. Most of the Urdu consonantal
characters fall into this category. These characters
and corresponding consonantal phonemes are
given in Table 3 below. A simple mapping rule
would generate the phoneme corresponding to
these characters.

Three characters of Urdu show dual behavior,
i.e. in certain contexts they transform into
consonants, but in certain other contexts, they
transform into vowels. These characters are Alef
(ا), vao (و), and Yay (ى or ے). Alef acts
exceptionally in this category and therefore it is
discussed separately in (j) below. Vao changes to
/v/ and Yay changes to the approximant /j/ when
they occur in consonantal positions (in onset or
coda of a syllable). However, when they occur as
nucleus of a syllable, they form long vowels. As
an example, Yay occurs as a consonant when it
occurs in the onset of single syllable word ر/ZŠ
(/jar/, “friend”) but is a vowel when it occurs word
َ
medially in LãŠZş (/bwl/, “ox”). These characters
represent category (b) listed above.
There is only one character in category (c), the
letter Noon Ghunna (ں), which does not add any
additional sound to the string but only nasalizes the
preceding vowel. This letter follows and combines
with the category (b) characters (when occurring as
vowels) to form the nasal long vowels, e.g. /ðş
(/d3Q/, “go”) vs. ں/ðş ( /d3Q/, “life”). Catergory
(d) is the letter Do-Chashmey Hay (ھ), which
combines with all the stops and affricates to form
aspirated (breathy or voiceless) consonants but
does not add an additional phoneme. It may also
combine with nasal stops and approximants to
form their aspirated versions, though these sounds
are not clearly established phonetically. As an
example, adding this character adds aspiration to
the phoneme /p/: LZŢ ( /pl/, “moment”) vs.
LņŢ\
(/phl/, “fruit”). Finally, there is also a single
character in category (e), the Alef Madda (آ). This
character is a stylistic way of writing two Alefs
and thus represents an Alef in consonantal position
(see (j) below) and an Alef in vocalic position,
َ ٓ
forming /a/ vowel, e.g. با (/b/, “now”) vs. با
(/Qb/, “water”).
There are three Basic vowel aerab used in Urdu
called Zabar (Arabic Fatha), Zer (Arabic Kasra)
and Pesh (Arabic Damma). In addition, absence of
these aerab also define certain vowels and thus this
absence is referred to as Null aerab. They combine
with characters to form vowels according to the
following principles:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999907">
(i) Short vowels, when they occur with category
(a) and (b) consonants not followed by
category (b) letters.
(ii) Long vowels, when they occur with category
(a) and (b) consonants followed and
combined by category (b) characters.
(iii) Long nasal vowels, when they combine with
category (a) and (b) consonants followed by
category (b) characters followed by category
(c) Noon Ghunna.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9457545">
Different combination of these aerab with
category (b) characters generate the various
vowels, as indicated in Table 4 (all vowels shown
in combination with ب (phoneme /b/) as a
consonant character is required as a placeholder for
the aerab).

Existence of the remaining vocalic phoneme /e/
is controversial in Urdu as there is no way of
expressing it using the Urdu writing system and
because it is schwa conditioned by the following
/h/ phoneme and only occurs in this context.
However, it may exist phonetically e.g. in the word
&lt;Ƒ (/eher/, “city”) (see discussion in Qureshi,
1992; also see some supporting acoustic evidence
in Fatima et. al, 2003, e.g. duration of /e/ is 136 ms
compared with 235 ms for /m/).
The next category (g) consists of Khari Zabar.
This represents the vowel Alef and, whenever
occurs on top of a Vao or Yay, replaces these
sounds with the Alef vowel sound /a/ as in words
ٰ
ةPƻز (/zkt/,&amp;quot;zakat&amp;quot;) and ٰTĶ ا (/ol/, special&amp;quot;).
Sporadically Khari Zer and Ulta Pesh are referred
to in Urdu as well but they generally do not occur
on Urdu words. These are not considered here.
The gemination mark of category (h) is called
Shad in Urdu and occurs on consonantal characters
(of categories (a, b) except Alef). Shad geminates
the consonant on which it occurs, which is
normally word medially and inter-vocalically. As
a result of gemination, the duplicate consonant acts
as coda of previous syllable and onset of following
syllable. For example, ا9Ư ( /go.d/, &amp;quot;a poor
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.552742">
person&amp;quot;) vs. ّ
ا9Ư ( /god.d/, &amp;quot;mattress&amp;quot;).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.984919291666667">
The category (i) aerab, called Do-Zabar only
occurs on Alef (in vocalic position) and converts
the long vowel /a/ to short schwa followed by
ً
consonant /n/, e.g. in word ارPƺ (/fron/,
&amp;quot;immediately&amp;quot;). Do-Zer and Do-Pesh are similarly
referred to in Urdu but are not generatively used
and are mostly in foreign words especially of
Arabic and are not considered further here. If
considered, they would present a similar analysis.
Finally, (j) is a very interesting category as it
represents allo-graphs Alef and Hamza (former a
character and latter (arguably) an aerab and
character3). Both of them are default markers and
occur in complimentary distribution, Alef always
word initially and Hamza always otherwise. As
discussed earlier, aerab in Urdu always need a
Kursi (“seat&amp;quot;). If a short vowel occurs word
initially without a consonant (i.e. in a syllable
which has no onset), there is no placeholder for
aerab. A default place holder is necessary and Alef
is used. Word medially, if there is an onset-less
syllable, Urdu faces the same problem. In these
cases, Hamza (instead of Alef) is used as a
placeholder for aerab. There are two further
possible sub-cases. In one, the preceding syllable
is open and ends with a vowel. This case is very
frequent and Hamza is introduced inter.-vocalically
(e.g. ہ 9Îِ /õ /fa.ideh/, “advantage”). In the second
less productive sub-case, the preceding syllable is
closed by a coda consonant. In this case, Hamza is
(optionally) used with Alef (e.g. both forms are
َٔ
correct: تا&lt;ðş / ا&lt;ð
ت ş /dr.ot/, “courage”).
Hindi which employs a different mechanism by
defining different shapes for vowels word-initially
and word-medially (Matras). The Matras are
anchored onto the consonants, e.g. in Aanað
vaalaa , “about to come” vowel /a/ is written as
Aa word initially, but is written as a word
medially).
These rules have been implemented in an on-
going project (see Footnote 1 above) and are
successfully generating the desired phonemic
output. This phonemic output is passed through
sound change rule module to generate the desired
phonetic form.

The second stage takes this phonetic representation of speech and generates the appropriate digital signal using a particular synthesis technique.

For SS, formant based techniques (e.g. Klatt 1980) or diphone based techniques (e.g. Dutoit 1997) are normally employed and are generally script independent (as they are only dependent on temporal and spectral acoustic properties of the language and take input in script-neutral form, e.g. in IPA). However, NLP is very dependent on cultural and linguistic specific usage of script. NLP may also be divided into further parts.

Nastaleeq is a cursive, context-sensitive and highly complex writing system (Hussain 2003). The character set includes basic and secondary letters, aerab (or diacritical marks), punctuation marks and special symbols (Hussain and Afzal 2001, Afzal and Hussain 2001). Urdu is normally written with only the letters. However, the letters represent just the consonantal content of the string and in some cases (under-specified) vocalic content. The vocalic content can be (optionally) completely specified by using the aerab with the letters. Aerab are normally not written and are assumed to be known by the native speaker, thus making it very hard for a foreigner to read. Certain aerab are a</context>

The intermediate output is then forwarded to a module which applies Urdu sound change rules to generate the corresponding phonetic string. Following these modules, Stress Marker and Intonation Marker modules add stress and intonation to the string being processed. Resyllabification is also performed after sound change rules are applied, in case phones are epenthesized or deleted and syllable boundaries require re-adjustment. Urdu shows a reasonably regular behavior and most of these tasks can be achieved through rule-based systems (e.g. see Hussain 1997 for stress assignment algorithm). This paper focuses on Letter-to-Sound rules for Urdu, the first in the series of modules in Phonological Processing Component. 4 Urdu Letter to Sound Rules Urdu shows a very regular mapping from graphemes to phonemes. However, to explain the behavior, the letters need to be further classified into the following categories: a. Consonantal characters b. Dual (consonantal and vocalic) behavior characters c.

The first stage takes raw text input, processes it and converts it into precise phonetic string to be spoken, appropriately annotated with prosodic markers (e.g. stress and intonation). The second stage takes this phonetic representation of speech and generates the appropriate digital signal using a particular synthesis technique. These stages may be referred to as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Synthesis (SS) respectively (e.g. Dutoit 1997, p.14).
