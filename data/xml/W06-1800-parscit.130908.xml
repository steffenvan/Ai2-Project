Preface
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791571428572">
Recent foundational, methodological and technological developments in advanced language
processing resources and techniques, knowledge representation, advanced reasoning forms
not necessarily based on unification, applied pragmatics, and recent progress in HLT make it
possible to foresee the elaboration of much more accurate, cooperative and robust systems
dedicated to NLP in general and to answering questions in particular. The development of
more robust evaluation techniques make it also possible to identify results, weaknesses and
future directions.
The goal of this workshop is to enhance cooperation between participants with an AI
background and the NLP community. After the 2005 edition, associated with IJCAI in
Edinburgh, the 2006 version of this workshop is organized around major questions of interest
to a number of NLP, AI, HLT and pragmatics people. Besides Question-Answering, which is
a hot topic in this perspective, the workshop addresses areas of NLP that require knowledge
and reasoning to perform better.
The following topics and the main points addressed during the workshop:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7956512">
• Reasoning aspects: dedicated inference schemas (in semantics, in pragmatics and in
interpretation phases), intelligent information processing, resolving redundancies or
inconsistencies, e.g. via fusion in NLG, search criteria expansion models (e.g.
relaxation techniques) in QA, inference in summarization, and reasoning under
uncertainty or with incomplete knowledge, e.g. in dialogue.
• Knowledge representation and integration: levels of knowledge involved in NLP (e.g.
ontologies, domain knowledge), and their relations to language, knowledge extraction
models and techniques, and coherence and integration.
• Flexible and interactive systems possibly including a user model,
• Language processing: question processing, language generation (e.g. lexical choice,

planning), use of language resources to develop reasoning schemas (e.g. lexical
semantics relations), reasoning to resolve ambiguities or references, explanation
production (showing sources and inferences, reporting data incompleteness, etc.),
argumentation, and intelligent language tutoring systems.
