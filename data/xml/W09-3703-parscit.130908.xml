Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.969398785714286">
The lack of large-scale corpora annotated with semantic information has
been a serious bottleneck for computational semantics, slowing down not
only the development of more advanced statistical methods, but also our
empirical understanding of the phenomena. The creation of the Ontonotes
corpus will finally bring computational semantics to the point where com-
putational syntax was in 1993 - but in the meantime, we have come to
appreciate the limitations of that methodology both theoretically and as
a way of gathering judgments. In this talk, I will discuss an ongoing ef-
fort to use the ’Games with a Purpose’ methodology to create a large-scale
anaphorically annotated corpus in which multiple judgments are maintained
about the interpretation of each anaphoric expression - and in particular,
the Phrase Detectives game:
