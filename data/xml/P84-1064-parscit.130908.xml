ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999039275862069">
Informally, a disposition is a proposition which is prepon-
derantly, but no necessarily always, true. For example, birds
can fly is a disposition, as are the propositions Swedes are
blond and Spaniards are dark.
An idea which underlies the theory described in this
paper is that a disposition may be viewed as a proposition
with implicit fuzzy quantifiers which are approximations to all
and always, e.g., almost all, almost always, most, frequently,
etc. For example, birds can fly may be interpreted as the
result of supressing the fuzzy quantifier most in the proposi-
tion most birds can fly. Similarly, young men like young women
may be read as most young men like mostly young women. The
process of transforming a disposition into a proposition is
referred to as explicit ation or restoration.
Explicitation sets the stage for representing the meaning
of a proposition through the use of test-score semantics
(Zadeh, 1978, 1982). In this approach to semantics, the mean-
ing of a proposition, p, is represented as a procedure which
tests, scores and aggregates the elastic constraints which are
induced by p.
The paper closes with a description of an approach to
reasoning with dispositions which is based on the concept of a
fuzzy syllogism. Syllogistic reasoning with dispositions has an
important bearing on commonsense reasoning as well as on
the management of uncertainty in expert systems. As a sim-
ple application of the techniques described in this paper, we
formulate a definition of typicality -- a concept which plays an
important role in human cognition and is of relevance to
default reasoning.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.982290055555556">
Informally, a disposition is a proposition which is prepon-
derantly, but not necessarily always, true. Simple examples of
dispositions are: Smoking is addictive, exercise is good for your
health, long sentences are more difficult to parse than short sen-
tences, overeating causes obesity, Trudi is always right, etc.
Dispositions play a central role in human reasoning, since
much of human knowledge and, especially, commonsense
knowledge, may be viewed as a collection of dispositions.
The concept of a disposition gives rise to a number of
related concepts among which is the concept of a diapoaitional
predicate. Familiar examples of unary predicates of this type
are: Healthy, honest, optimist, safe, etc., with binary disposi-
tional predicates exemplified by: taller than in Swede, are taller
than Frenchmen, like in Italians are like Spaniards, like in
young men like young women, and smokes in Ron smokes
cigarette,. Another related concept is that of a dispositional
command (or imperative) which is exemplified by proceed with
caution, avoid overexertion, keep under refrigeration, be frank,
etc.

The basic idea underlying the approach described in this
paper is that a disposition may be viewed as a proposition
with suppressed, or, more generally, implicit fuzzy quantifiers
such as moat&apos;&apos; almost all, almost always, usually, rarely, much of
the time, etc&apos;. To illustrate, the disposition overating causes
obesity may be viewed as the result of suppression of the fuzzy
quantifier most in the proposition most of those who overeat
are obese. Similarly, the disposition young men like young
women may be interpreted as most young men like mostly
young women. It should be stressed, however, that restoration
(or explicitation)-- viewed as the inverse of suppression — is an
interpretation-dependent process in the sense that, in general,
a disposition may be interpreted in different ways depending
on the manner in which the fuzzy quantifiers are restored and
defined.
The implicit presence of fuzzy quantifiers stands in the
way of representing the meaning of dispositional concepts
through the use of conventional methods based on truth-
conditional, possible-world or model-theoretic semantics
(Cresswell, 1973; McCawley, 1981; Miller and Johnson-Laird,
1974).---1n the computational approach which is described in
this paper, a fuzzy quantifier is manipulated as a fuzzy
number. This idea serves two purposes. First, it provides a
basis for representing the meaning of dispositions; and second,
it opens a way of reasoning with dispositions through the use
of a collection of syllogisms. This aspect of the concept of a
disposition is of relevance to default reasoning and non-
monotonic logic (McCarthy, 1980; McDermott and Doyle,
1980; McDermott, 1982; Reiter, 1983).
To illustrate the manner in which fuzzy quantifiers may
be manipulated as fuzzy numbers, assume that, after restora-
tion, two dispositions di and d2 may be expressed as proposi-
tions of the form
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99426">
Pi 41 (21 A 8 are B&apos; (1.1)
P2 &apos;1= Q2 B5 are C&apos;s, (1.2)

<bodyText confidence="0.9980245">
in which Qi and Q2 are fuzzy quantifiers, and A, B and C are
fuzzy predicates. For example,

<equation confidence="0.938425">
A
Pt — most students are undergraduates (1.3)
a
P2 = most undergraduates are young .
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.685776111111111">
By treating pi and p2 as the major and minor premises in
a syllogism, the following chaining syllogism may be esta-
blished if B C A (Zadeh, 1983):
I. In the literature of linguistics, logic and philosophy of languages, fuz-
zy quantifiers are usually referred to as vague or generalized quantifiers
(Barwise and Cooper, 1981; Peterson, 1979). In the approach described
in this paper, a fuzzy quantifier is interpreted as a fuzzy number which
provides an approximate characterization of absolute or relative cardi-
nality.

2. Meaning Representation and Test-Score Semantics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980364761904762">
To represent the meaning of a disposition, d, vie employ
a two-stage process. First, the suppressed fuzzy quantifiers in
d are restored, resulting in a fuzzily quantified proposition p.
Then, the meaning of p is represented -- through the use of
test-score semantics (Zadeh, 1978, 1982) — as a procedure
which acts on a collection of relations in an explanatory data-
base and returns a test score which represents the degree of
compatibility of p with the database. In effect, this implies
that p may be viewed as a collection of elastic constraints
which are tested, scored and aggregated by the meaning-
representation procedure. In test-score semantics, these elastic
constraints play a role which is analogous to that truth-
conditions in truth-conditional semantics (Cresswell, 1973).
As a simple illustration, consider the familiar example
d snow is white
which we interpret as a disposition whose intended meaning is
the proposition
p usually snow is white .
To represent the meaning of p, we assume that the explana-
tory database, EDF (Zadeh, 1982), consists of the following
relations whose meaning is presumed to be known
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.330767">
EDF WHITE [Sample;p] + USUALLYIProportion;p] ,
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999140090909091">
in which + should be read as and. The ith row in WHITE is
a tuple (S„r,), i = 1,...,m, in which S, is the ith sample of
snow, and r, is is the degree to which the color of S, matches
white. Thus, r, may be interpreted as the test score for the
constraint on the color of S, induced by the elastic constraint
WH/TE. Similarly, the relation USUALLY may be inter-
preted as an elastic constraint on the variable Proportion, with
p representing the test score associated with a numerical value
of Proportion.
The steps in the procedure which represents the meaning
of p may be described as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.952474">
1. Find the proportion of samples whose color is white:
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.81511">
r1-1- • • • + r„,
—

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.87137825">
More generally, to represent the meaning of a disposition
it is necessary to define the cardinality of a fuzzy set.
Specifically, if A is a subset of a finite universe of discourse
U =-- (ui,...,u„), then the sigma-count of A is defined as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.988065">
E Count(A ) = , pit( u, ) , (2.1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919833333333">
in which pA(u,), i == 1,...,n, is the grade of membership of u,
in A (Zadeh, 1983a), and it is understood that the sum may be
rounded, if need be, to the nearest integer. Furthermore, one
may stipulate that the terms whose grade of membership falls
below a specified threshold be excluded from the summation.
The purpose of such an exclusion is to avoid a situation in
which a large number of terms with low grades of membership
become count-equivalent to a small number of terms with high
membership.
The relative sigma-count, denoted by ECount(BIA ), may
be interpreted as the proportion of elements of B in A. More
explicitly,
</bodyText>

ECount(B I A) — ECount(A fl B) (2.2)

To represent the meaning of p, we shall employ an expla-
natory database whose constituent relations are:
EDF A POPULATION[Name; Overeat; Obese]
+ MOST[Proportion;p1 .
The relation POPULATION is a list of names of individuals,
with the variables Overeat and Obese representing, respec-
tively, the degrees to which Name overeats and is obese. In
MOST, p is the degree to which a numerical value of Propor-
tion fits the intended meaning of MOST.

3. The Scope of a Fuzzy Quantifier
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973726675">
In dealing with the conventional quantifiers all and some
in first-order logic, the scope of a quantifier plays an essential
role in defining its meaning. In the case of a fuzzy quantifier
which is characterized by a relative sigma-count, what matters
is the identity of the sets which enter into the relative count.
Thus, if the sigma-count is of the form ECount(BIA ), which
should be read as the proportion of B&apos; a in A &apos; s, then B and
A will be referred to as the n-set (with n standing for numera-
tor) and b-set (with b standing for base), respectively. The
ordered pair (n-set, b-set), then, may be viewed as a generali-
zation of the concept of the scope of a quantifier. Note, how-
ever, that, in this sense, the scope of a fuzzy quantifier is a
semantic rather than syntactic concept.
As a simple illustration, consider the proposition
p 1 most students are undergraduates. In this case, the n-
set of most is undergraduates, the b-set is students, and the
scope of most is the pair (undergraduates, students).
2. It should be understood that (2.5) is just one of many possible in-
terpretations of (2.4), with no implicat;on that is constitutes a prescrip-
tive interpretation of causality. See Suppes (1970).
As an additional illustration of the interaction between
scope and meaning, consider the disposition
d I young men like young women . (3.1)
Among the possible interpretations of this disposition, we
shall focus our attention on the following (the symbol rd
denotes a restoration of a disposition):
rd, I most young men like most young women
rd2 I most young men like mostly young women .
To place in evidence the difference between rd, and rd2,
it is expedient to express them in the form
rd, = most young men P1
rd2 == most young men P2 ,
where P1 and P2 are the fuzzy predicates
P, A likes most young women
and
P2 1 likes mostly young women ,
with the understanding that, for grammatical correctness, likes
in P1 and P2 should be replaced by like when P1 and P2 act
as constituents of rd, and rd2. In more explicit terms,
P, and P2 may be expressed as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9872425">
P1 A Pi[Name;pj (3.2)
P2-4 P2IName;P]
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998675">
in which Name is the name of a male person and p is the
degree to which the person in question satisfies the predicate.
(Equivalently, p is the grade of membership of the person in
the fuzzy set which represents the denotation or, equivalently,
the extension of the predicate.)
To represent the meaning of P1 and P2 through the use
of test-score semantics, we assume that the explanatory data-
base consists of the following relations (Zadeh, 19836):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.851719">
EDF A POPULATION[Name; Age; Sex] +

<bodyText confidence="0.9978848">
In LIKE, p is the degree to which Narnel likes Name2 ;
and in YOUNG, p is the degree to which a person whose age is

ing test procedure.

Concepts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95330394117647">
The approach described in the preceding sections can be
applied not only to the representation of the meaning of dispo-
sitions and dispositional predicates, but, more generally, to
various types of semantic entities as well as dispositional con-
cepts.
As an illustration of its application to the representation
of the meaning of dispositional commands, consider
de A stay away from bald men , (4.1)
whose explicit representation will be assumed to be the com-
mand
e A stay away from most bald men . (4.2)
The meaning of c is defined by its compliance criterion (Zadeh,
1982) or, equivalently, its propositional content (Searle, 1979),
which may be expressed as
cc A staying away from most bald men .
To represent the meaning of cc through the use of test-
score semantics, we shall employ the explanatory database

kept during the period of interest -- in which Name is the

Action describes whether the man in question was stayed away

The test procedure which defines the meaning of dc may
be described as follows:

The concept of dispositionality applies not only to seman-
tic entities such as propositions, predicates, commands, etc.,
but, more generally, to concepts and their definitions. As an
illustration, we shall consider the concept of typicality -- a
concept which plays a basic role in human reasoning, especially
in default reasoning IReiter, 1983), concept formation (Smith
and Media, 1981), and pattern recognition (Zadeh, 1977).
Let U be a universe of discourse and let A be a fuzzy set
in A (e.g., U cars and A station wagons). The
definition of a typical element of A may be expressed in verbal
terms as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.794047333333333">
t is a typical element of A if and only if (4.5)
(a) t has a high grade of membership in A, and
(b) most elements of A are similar to t.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907764705882">
It should be remarked that this definition should be viewed as
a dispositional definition, that is, as a definition which may
fail, in some cases, to reflect our intuitive perception of the
meaning of typicality.
To put the verbal definition expressed by (4.5) into a
more precise form, we can employ test-score semantics to
represent the meaning of (a) and (b). Specifically, let S be a
similarity relation defined on U which associates with each ele-
ment u in U the degree to which u is similar to t . Further-
more, let S(t) be the similarity clasa of t, i.e., the fuzzy set of
elements of U which are similar to t. What this means is that
the grade of membership of u in 5(t) is equal to ps(t,u), the
degree to which u is similar to t (Zadeh, 1971).
Let HIGH denote the fuzzy subset of the unit interval
which is the extension of the fuzzy predicate high. Then, the
verbal definition (4.5) may be expressed more precisely in the
form:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.919514">
t is a typical element of A if and only if (4.6)
3. For consistency with the definition of A, S must be such that if u
and te have a high degree of similarity, then their grades of member-
ship in A should be close in magnitude.
(a) ILA(t) is HIGH
(b) ECount(S(t)1 A)is MOST.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.943034">
The fuzzy predicate high may be characterized by its
membership function pHiGH or, equivalently, as the fuzzy rela-
ton HIGH [Grade; pl, in which Grade is a number in the inter-
val [0,1] and A is the degree to which the value of Grade fits
the intended meaning of high.
An important implication of this definition is that typi-
cality is a matter of degree. Thus, it follows at once from (4.6)
that the degree, r, to which t is typical or, equivalently, the
grade of membership of t in the fuzzy set of typical elements
of A, is given by
r= ,HIGH[Grade =-- tj A (4.7)
MOST [Proportion = ECount(S(t)1 A] .
In terms of the membership functions of HIGH, MOST,S
and A, (4.7) may be written as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.961446">
= fts PS(t,u) A PA(u)
rPA(t) A PMOST , (4.8)
Eu Ps(u)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987177217391304">
where piaci!, pmosT, ps and pA are the membership functions
of HIGH, MOST, S and A, respectively, and the summation
E„ extends over the elements of U.
It is of interest to observe that if pA(t) = 1 and
(4.9)
that is, the grade of membership of u in A is equal to the
degree of similarity of u to t, then the degree of typicality of t
is unity. This is reminiscent of definitions of prototypicality
(Rosch, 1978) in which the grade of membership of an object
in a category is assumed to be inversely related to its &amp;quot;dis-
tance&amp;quot; from the prototype.
In a definition of prototypicality which we gave in Zadeh
(1982), a prototype is interpreted as a so-called -summary.
In relation to the definition of typicality expressed by (4.5), we
may say tbat a prototype is a a -summary of typical elements
of A . In this sense, a prototype is not, in general, an element
of U whereas a typical element of A is, by definition, an ele-
ment of U. As a simple illustration of this difference, assume
that U is a collection of movies, and A is the fuzzy set of
Western movies. A prototype of A is a summary of the sum-
maries (i.e., plots) of Western movies, and thus is not a movie.
A typical Western movie, on the other hand, is a movie and
thus is an element of U.

5. Fuzzy Syllogisms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999335">
A concept which plays an essential role in reasoning with
dispositions is that of a fuzzy syllogism (Zadeh, I983c). As a
general inference schema, a fuzzy syllogism may be expressed
in the form
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.646725666666667">

where Q1 and Q2 are given fuzzy quantifiers, Q3 is fuzzy
quantifier which is to be determined, and A, B, C, D, E and F
are interrelated fuzzy predicates.
In what follows, we shall present a brief discussion of two
basic types of fuzzy syllogisms. A more detailed description of
these and other fuzzy syllogisms may be found in Zadeh
(1983c, 1984).
The intersection/product syllogism may be viewed as an
instance of (5.1) in which

and Qg = Q1 0 Q2, i.e., Q3 is the product of Qi and Q2 in
fuzzy arithmetic. Thus, we have as the statement of the syllo-
gism:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.315887666666667">

Q2(A and BY are C&apos;

<figureCaption confidence="0.294548">
In particular, if B is contained in A, i.e., pB &lt; PA, where PA
and pB are the membership functions of A and B, respec-
tively, then A and B =-- B, and (5.2) becomes

(2, A &apos; s are B&apos;s (5.3)
Q2B&apos;s are C&apos;s
(Qi 0 Q2) A&apos; 8 are (B and C)1
Since B and C implies C, it follows at once from (5.3)
that
Q, A &apos; a are B&apos; (5.4)
Q2 B&apos;s are C&apos;s
&gt; (Q1 0 Q2) A&apos;s are C&apos;s ,
which is the chaining syllogism expressed by (1.4). Further-
more, if the quantifiers Qi and Q2 are monotonic, i.e.,
&gt; Qi =-- Qi and &gt; Q2 = Q2, then (5.4) becomes the product
syllogism
Q, A&apos;s are B&apos; (5.5)
Q2B1 s are C&apos;s
(Qi 0 Q2) Ate are C&apos;s
In the case of the consequent conjunction syllogism, we
have
C A
E a A
F B and D .
In this case, the statement of syllogism is:
Qi A is are B&apos;. (5.6)
Q2A&apos;s are C&apos;s

where 9 , 9 0 and 9 are the operations of addition, subtrac-

<construct confidence="0.283689">

<bodyText confidence="0.9249015">
Upon restoration, these dispositions become the propositions
A
pi = most students are young
)92 most students are single
Then, applying the consequent conjunction syllogism to pi and
P2&apos; we can infer that
Q students are single and young
where
2 mostel &lt; Q &lt; most . (5.8)
Thus, from the dispositions in question we can infer the dispo-
sition
d students are single and young
on the understanding that the implicit fuzzy quantifier in d is
expressed by (5.8).
8. Negation of Dispositions
In dealing with dispositions, it is natural to raise the
question: What happens when a disposition is acted upon with
an operator, T, where T might be the operation of negation,
active-to-passive transformation, etc. More generally, the
same question may be asked when T is an operator which is
defined on pairs or n-tuples of dispositions.
As an illustration, we shall focus our attention on the
operation of negation. More specifically, the question which
we shall consider briefly is the following: Given a disposition,
d, what can be said about the negaton of d, not (1? For exam-
ple, what can be said about not (birds can fly) or not (young
men like young women).
For simplicity, assume that, after restoration, d may be
expressed in the form
rd Q A&apos;s are B&apos;s . (6.1)
Then,
not d = not (Q A &apos; 8 are B&apos;s) . (6.2)
Now, using the semantic equivalence established in Zadeh
(1978), we may write
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.278843">
not (Q A&apos;sare B&apos;s) = (not Q) A&apos;sare B&apos; , (6.3)
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.877490545454545">
where not Q is the complement of the fuzzy quantifier Q in
the sense that the membership function of not Q is given by
pnoi 9(u) =-- 1-p,(u),0 &lt; u &lt; 1 . (6.4)
Furthermore, the following inference rule can readily be
established (Zadeh, 1983a):
&gt; (ant Q) A&apos; a are not B&apos;
Q A&apos;s are B&apos;s (6.5)
where ant Q denotes the antonym of Q, defined by
pant,(u)= pc,(1-u) , 0 &lt; u &lt; 1 , (6.8)
On combining (6.3) and (6.5), we are led to the following
result:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.904182111111111">
not(Q A are B&apos; 8) = (6.7)
&gt; (ant (not Q)) A &apos;a are not B&apos;s
which reduces to
not(Q A &apos; e are B&apos; s)= (8.8)
(ant (not Q)) A &apos;a are not B&apos;s
if Q is monotonic (e.g., Q most).
As an illustration, if d birds can fly and Q most,
then (8.8) yields
not (birds can fly) (ant (not most)) birds cannot fly . (8.9)
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.990405">
It should be observed that if Q is an approximation to
all, then ant(not Q) is an approximation to some. For the
right-hand member of (8.9) to be a disposition, most must be
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993931">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999845">
an approximation to at least a half. In this case ant (not most)
will be an approximation to most, and consequently the right-
hand member of (6.9) may be expressed -- upon the suppres-
sion of most -- as the disposition birds cannot fly.

It should be stressed, however, that restoration (or explicitation)-- viewed as the inverse of suppression — is an interpretation-dependent process in the sense that, in general, a disposition may be interpreted in different ways depending on the manner in which the fuzzy quantifiers are restored and defined. The implicit presence of fuzzy quantifiers stands in the way of representing the meaning of dispositional concepts through the use of conventional methods based on truthconditional, possible-world or model-theoretic semantics (Cresswell, 1973; McCawley, 1981; Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1974).---1n the computational approach which is described in this paper, a fuzzy quantifier is manipulated as a fuzzy number. This idea serves two purposes. First, it provides a basis for representing the meaning of dispositions; and second, it opens a way of reasoning with dispositions through the use of a collection of syllogisms. This aspect of the concept of a disposition is of relevance to default reasoning and nonmonotonic logic (McCarthy, 1980; McDermott and Doyle, 1980; McDermott, 1982; Reiter, 1983). To illustrate the manner in which fuzzy q</context>

Then, the meaning of p is represented -- through the use of test-score semantics (Zadeh, 1978, 1982) — as a procedure which acts on a collection of relations in an explanatory database and returns a test score which represents the degree of compatibility of p with the database. In effect, this implies that p may be viewed as a collection of elastic constraints which are tested, scored and aggregated by the meaningrepresentation procedure. In test-score semantics, these elastic constraints play a role which is analogous to that truthconditions in truth-conditional semantics (Cresswell, 1973). As a simple illustration, consider the familiar example d snow is white which we interpret as a disposition whose intended meaning is the proposition p usually snow is white . To represent the meaning of p, we assume that the explanatory database, EDF (Zadeh, 1982), consists of the following relations whose meaning is presumed to be known EDF WHITE [Sample;p] + USUALLYIProportion;p] , in which + should be read as and. The ith row in WHITE is a tuple (S„r,), i = 1,...,m, in which S, is the ith sample of snow, and r, is is the degree to which the color of S, matches white. Thus, r, may be inte</context>

This aspect of the concept of a disposition is of relevance to default reasoning and nonmonotonic logic (McCarthy, 1980; McDermott and Doyle, 1980; McDermott, 1982; Reiter, 1983).

The concept of dispositionality applies not only to semantic entities such as propositions, predicates, commands, etc., but, more generally, to concepts and their definitions. As an illustration, we shall consider the concept of typicality -- a concept which plays a basic role in human reasoning, especially in default reasoning IReiter, 1983), concept formation (Smith and Media, 1981), and pattern recognition (Zadeh, 1977). Let U be a universe of discourse and let A be a fuzzy set in A (e.g., U cars and A station wagons). The definition of a typical element of A may be expressed in verbal terms as follows: t is a typical element of A if and only if (4.5) (a) t has a high grade of membership in A, and (b) most elements of A are similar to t. It should be remarked that this definition should be viewed as a dispositional definition, that is, as a definition which may fail, in some cases, to reflect our intuitive perception of the meaning of typicality.

Similarly, young men like young women may be read as most young men like mostly young women. The process of transforming a disposition into a proposition is referred to as explicit ation or restoration. Explicitation sets the stage for representing the meaning of a proposition through the use of test-score semantics (Zadeh, 1978, 1982). In this approach to semantics, the meaning of a proposition, p, is represented as a procedure which tests, scores and aggregates the elastic constraints which are induced by p. The paper closes with a description of an approach to reasoning with dispositions which is based on the concept of a fuzzy syllogism. Syllogistic reasoning with dispositions has an important bearing on commonsense reasoning as well as on the management of uncertainty in expert systems. As a simple application of the techniques described in this paper, we formulate a definition of typicality -- a concept which p</context>

First, the suppressed fuzzy quantifiers in d are restored, resulting in a fuzzily quantified proposition p. Then, the meaning of p is represented -- through the use of test-score semantics (Zadeh, 1978, 1982) — as a procedure which acts on a collection of relations in an explanatory database and returns a test score which represents the degree of compatibility of p with the database. In effect, this implies that p may be viewed as a collection of elastic constraints which are tested, scored and aggregated by the meaningrepresentation procedure. In test-score semantics, these elastic constraints play a role which is analogous to that truthconditions in truth-conditional semantics (Cresswell, 1973).

For example, what can be said about not (birds can fly) or not (young men like young women). For simplicity, assume that, after restoration, d may be expressed in the form rd Q A&apos;s are B&apos;s . (6.1) Then, not d = not (Q A &apos; 8 are B&apos;s) . (6.2) Now, using the semantic equivalence established in Zadeh (1978), we may write not (Q A&apos;sare B&apos;s) = (not Q) A&apos;sare B&apos; , (6.3) where not Q is the complement of the fuzzy quantifier Q in the sense that the membership function of not Q is given by pnoi 9(u) =-- 1-p,(u),0 &lt; u &lt; 1 .

In the literature of linguistics, logic and philosophy of languages, fuzzy quantifiers are usually referred to as vague or generalized quantifiers (Barwise and Cooper, 1981; Peterson, 1979).

The steps in the procedure which represents the meaning of p may be described as follows: 1. Find the proportion of samples whose color is white: r1-1- • • • + r„, — /1. More generally, to represent the meaning of a disposition it is necessary to define the cardinality of a fuzzy set. Specifically, if A is a subset of a finite universe of discourse U =-- (ui,...,u„), then the sigma-count of A is defined as E Count(A ) = , pit( u, ) , (2.1) in which pA(u,), i == 1,...,n, is the grade of membership of u, in A (Zadeh, 1983a), and it is understood that the sum may be rounded, if need be, to the nearest integer. Furthermore, one may stipulate that the terms whose grade of membership falls below a specified threshold be excluded from the summation. The purpose of such an exclusion is to avoid a situation in which a large number of terms with low grades of membership become count-equivalent to a small number of terms with high membership. The relative sigma-count, denoted by ECount(BIA ), may be interpreted as the proportion of elements of B in A. More explicitly, ECount(B I A) — ECount(A fl B) (2.2) ECount(A) wher</context>

(Equivalently, p is the grade of membership of the person in the fuzzy set which represents the denotation or, equivalently, the extension of the predicate.) To represent the meaning of P1 and P2 through the use of test-score semantics, we assume that the explanatory database consists of the following relations (Zadeh, 19836): EDF A POPULATION[Name; Age; Sex] + LIKE[Namel;Name2; p1 + YOUNG [Age; pl + MOST[Proportion; p].

To illustrate the manner in which fuzzy quantifiers may be manipulated as fuzzy numbers, assume that, after restoration, two dispositions di and d2 may be expressed as propositions of the form Pi 41 (21 A 8 are B&apos; (1.1) P2 &apos;1= Q2 B5 are C&apos;s, (1.2) in which Qi and Q2 are fuzzy quantifiers, and A, B and C are fuzzy predicates. For example, A Pt — most students are undergraduates (1.3) a P2 = most undergraduates are young . By treating pi and p2 as the major and minor premises in a syllogism, the following chaining syllogism may be established if B C A (Zadeh, 1983): I. In the literature of linguistics, logic and philosophy of languages, fuzzy quantifiers are usually referred to as vague or generalized quantifiers (Barwise and Cooper, 1981; Peterson, 1979). In the approach described in this paper, a fuzzy quantifier is interpreted as a fuzzy number which provides an approximate characterization of absolute or relative cardinality. 312 Q1 A are B&apos;s(1.4) Q2 B&apos; are C&apos;s &gt;(Qi 0 Q2) A&apos; s are C&apos;s in which (21 0 Q2 represents the product of the fuzzy numbers Q1 and Q2 (Figure 1).

The steps in the procedure which represents the meaning of p may be described as follows: 1. Find the proportion of samples whose color is white: r1-1- • • • + r„, — /1. More generally, to represent the meaning of a disposition it is necessary to define the cardinality of a fuzzy set. Specifically, if A is a subset of a finite universe of discourse U =-- (ui,...,u„), then the sigma-count of A is defined as E Count(A ) = , pit( u, ) , (2.1) in which pA(u,), i == 1,...,n, is the grade of membership of u, in A (Zadeh, 1983a), and it is understood that the sum may be rounded, if need be, to the nearest integer. Furthermore, one may stipulate that the terms whose grade of membership falls below a specified threshold be excluded from the summation. The purpose of such an exclusion is to avoid a situation in which a large number of terms with low grades of membership become count-equivalent to a small number of terms with high membership. The relative sigma-count, denoted by ECount(BIA ), may be interpreted as the proportion of elements of B in A. More explicitly, ECount(B I A) — ECount(A fl B) (2.2) ECount(A) wher</context>

In more explicit terms, P, and P2 may be expressed as P1 A Pi[Name;pj (3.2) P2-4 P2IName;P] in which Name is the name of a male person and p is the degree to which the person in question satisfies the predicate. (Equivalently, p is the grade of membership of the person in the fuzzy set which represents the denotation or, equivalently, the extension of the predicate.) To represent the meaning of P1 and P2 through the use of test-score semantics, we assume that the explanatory database consists of the following relations (Zadeh, 19836): EDF A POPULATION[Name; Age; Sex] + LIKE[Namel;Name2; p1 + YOUNG [Age; pl + MOST[Proportion; p]. In LIKE, p is the degree to which Narnel likes Name2 ; and in YOUNG, p is the degree to which a person whose age is Age is young.
