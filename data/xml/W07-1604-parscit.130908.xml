Abstract

This paper presents ongoing work on the de-
tection of preposition errors of non-native
speakers of English. Since prepositions
account for a substantial proportion of all
grammatical errors by ESL (English as a
Second Language) learners, developing an
NLP application that can reliably detect
these types of errors will provide an invalu-
able learning resource to ESL students. To
address this problem, we use a maximum
entropy classifier combined with rule-based
filters to detect preposition errors in a corpus
of student essays. Although our work is pre-
liminary, we achieve a precision of 0.8 with
a recall of 0.3.

The National Clearinghouse for English Language
Acquisition (2002) estimates that 9.6% of the stu-
dents in the US public school population speak a
language other than English and have limited En-
glish proficiency. Clearly, there is a substantial and
increasing need for tools for instruction in English
as a Second Language (ESL).
In particular, preposition usage is one of the most
difficult aspects of English grammar for non-native
speakers to master. Preposition errors account for
a significant proportion of all ESL grammar errors.
They represented the largest category, about 29%,
of all the errors by 53 intermediate to advanced ESL
students (Bitchener et al., 2005), and 18% of all er-
rors reported in an intensive analysis of one Japanese

writer (Murata and Ishara, 2004). Preposition errors
are not only prominent among error types, they are
also quite frequent in ESL writing. Dalgish (1985)
analyzed the essays of 350 ESL college students
representing 15 different native languages and re-
ported that preposition errors were present in 18%
of sentences in a sample of text produced by writ-
ers from first languages as diverse as Korean, Greek,
and Spanish.
The goal of the research described here is to pro-
vide software for detecting common grammar and
usage errors in the English writing of non-native En-
glish speakers. Our work targets errors involving
prepositions, specifically those of incorrect preposi-
tion selection, such as arrive to the town, and those
of extraneous prepositions, as in most ofpeople.
We present an approach that combines machine
learning with rule-based filters to detect preposition
errors in a corpus of ESL essays. Even though this
is work in progress, we achieve precision of 0.8 with
a recall of 0.3. The paper is structured as follows: in
the next section, we describe the difficulty in learn-
ing English preposition usage; in Section 3, we dis-
cuss related work; in Sections 4-7 we discuss our
methodology and evaluation.

2 Problem of Preposition Usage
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998315">
Why are prepositions so difficult to master? Perhaps
it is because they perform so many complex roles. In
English, prepositions appear in adjuncts, they mark
the arguments of predicates, and they combine with
other parts of speech to express new meanings.
The choice of preposition in an adjunct is largely
constrained by its object (in the summer, on Friday,

at noon) and the intended meaning (at the beach,
on the beach, near the beach, by the beach). Since
adjuncts are optional and tend to be flexible in their
position in a sentence, the task facing the learner is
quite complex.
Prepositions are also used to mark the arguments
of a predicate. Usually, the predicate is expressed
by a verb, but sometimes it takes the form of an ad-
jective (He was fond of beer), a noun (They have
a thirst for knowledge), or a nominalization (The
child’s removal from the classroom). The choice of
the preposition as an argument marker depends on
the type of argument it marks, the word that fills the
argument role, the particular word used as the pred-
icate, and whether the predicate is a nominalization.
Even with these constraints, there are still variations
in the ways in which arguments can be expressed.
Levin (1993) catalogs verb alternations such as They
loaded hay on the wagon vs. They loaded the wagon
with hay, which show that, depending on the verb,
an argument may sometimes be marked by a prepo-
sition and sometimes not.
English has hundreds of phrasal verbs, consist-
ing of a verb and a particle (some of which are
also prepositions). To complicate matters, phrasal
verbs are often used with prepositions (i.e., give up
on someone; give in to their demands). Phrasal
verbs are particularly difficult for non-native speak-
ers to master because of their non-compositionality
of meaning, which forces the learner to commit them
to rote memory.

If mastering English prepositions is a daunting task
for the second language learner, it is even more
so for a computer. To our knowledge, only three
other groups have attempted to automatically de-
tect errors in preposition usage. Eeg-Olofsson et al.
(2003) used 31 handcrafted matching rules to detect
extraneous, omitted, and incorrect prepositions in
Swedish text written by native speakers of English,
Arabic, and Japanese. The rules, which were based
on the kinds of errors that were found in a training
set of text produced by non-native Swedish writers,
targeted spelling errors involving prepositions and
some particularly problematic Swedish verbs. In a
test of the system, 11 of 40 preposition errors were
correctly detected.
Izumi et al. (2003) and (2004) used error-
annotated transcripts of Japanese speakers in an
interview-based test of spoken English to train a
maximum entropy classifier (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) to
recognize 13 different types of grammatical and lex-
ical errors, including errors involving prepositions.
The classifier relied on lexical and syntactic features.
Overall performance for the 13 error types reached
25.1% precision with 7.1% recall on an independent
test set of sentences from the same source, but the
researchers do not separately report the results for
preposition error detection. The approach taken by
Izumi and colleagues is most similar to the one we
have used, which is described in the next section.
More recently, (Lee and Seneff, 2006) used a
language model and stochastic grammar to replace
prepositions removed from a dialogue corpus. Even
though they reported a precision of 0.88 and recall
of 0.78, their evaluation was on a very restricted do-
main with only a limited number of prepositions,
nouns and verbs.

4 The Selection Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965391304348">
A preposition error can be a case of incorrect prepo-
sition selection (They arrived to the town), use of a
preposition in a context where it is prohibited (They
came to inside), or failure to use a preposition in a
context where it is obligatory (e.g., He is fond this
book). To detect the first type of error, incorrect
selection, we have employed a maximum entropy
(ME) model to estimate the probability of each of
34 prepositions, based on the features in their lo-
cal contexts. The ME Principle says that the best
model will satisfy the constraints found in the train-
ing, and for those situations not covered in the train-
ing, the best model will assume a distribution of
maximum entropy. This approach has been shown
to perform well in combining heterogeneous forms
of evidence, as in word sense disambiguation (Rat-
naparkhi, 1998). It also has the desirable property of
handling interactions among features without having
to rely on the assumption of feature independence,
as in a Naive Bayesian model.
Our ME model was trained on 7 million “events”
consisting of an outcome (the preposition that ap-
peared in the training text) and its associated con-

text (the set of feature-value pairs that accompa-
nied it). These 7 million prepositions and their con-
texts were extracted from the MetaMetrics corpus of
1100 and 1200 Lexile text (11th and 12th grade) and
newspaper text from the San Jose Mercury News.
The sentences were then POS-tagged (Ratnaparkhi,
1998) and then chunked into noun phrases and verb
phrases by a heuristic chunker.
The maximum entropy model was trained with
25 contextual features. Some of the features repre-
sented the words and tags found at specific locations
adjacent to the preposition; others represented the
head words and tags of phrases that preceded or fol-
lowed the preposition. Table 1 shows a subset of the
feature list.
Some features had only a few values while oth-
ers had many. PHR pre is the “preceding phrase”
feature that indicates whether the preposition was
preceded by a noun phrase (NP) or a verb phrase
(VP). In the example in Table 2, the preposition
into is preceded by an NP. In a sentence that be-
gins After the crowd was whipped up into a frenzy
of anticipation, the preposition into is preceded by
a VP. There were only two feature#value pairs for
this feature: PHR pre#NP and PHR pre#VP. Other
features had hundreds or even thousands of differ-
ent values because they represented the occurrence
of specific words that preceded or followed a prepo-
sition. Any feature#value pairs which occurred with
very low frequency in the training (less than 10 times
in the 7 million contexts) were eliminated to avoid
the need for smoothing their probabilities. Lemma
forms of words were used as feature values to fur-
ther reduce the total number and to allow the model
to generalize across inflectional variants. Even after
incorporating these reductions, the number of val-
ues was still very large. As Table 1 indicates, TGR,
the word sequence including the preposition and the
two words to its right, had 54,906 different values.
Summing across all features, the model contained a
total of about 388,000 feature#value pairs. Table 2
shows an example of where some of the features are
derived from.

5 Evaluation on Grammatical Text
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982195121951">
The model was tested on 18,157 preposition con-
texts extracted from 12 files randomly selected from
a portion of 1100 Lexile text (11th grade) that had
not been used for training. For each context, the
model predicted the probability of each preposi-
tion given the contextual representation. The high-
est probability preposition was then compared to
the preposition that had actually been used by the
writer. Because the test corpus consisted of pub-
lished, edited text, we assumed that this material
contained few, if any, errors. In this and subsequent
tests, the model was used to classify each context as
one of 34 classes (prepositions).
Results of the comparison between the classifier
and the test set showed that the overall proportion
of agreement between the text and the classifier was
0.69. The value of kappa was 0.64. When we ex-
amined the errors, we discovered that, frequently,
the classifier’s most probable preposition (the one
it assigned) differed from the second most probable
by just a few percentage points. This corresponded
to a situation in which two or more prepositions
were likely to be found in a given context. Con-
sider the context They thanked him for his consider-
ation this matter, where either of or in could fill
the blank. Because the classifier was forced to make
a choice in this and other close cases, it incurred a
high probability of making an error. To avoid this
situation, we re-ran the test allowing the classifier
to skip any preposition if its top ranked and sec-
ond ranked choices differed by less than a specified
amount. In other words, we permitted it to respond
only when it was confident of its decision. When
the difference between the first and second ranked
choices was 0.60 or greater, 50% of the cases re-
ceived no decision, but for the remaining half of the
test cases, the proportion of agreement was 0.90 and
kappa was 0.88. This suggests that a considerable
improvement in performance can be achieved by us-
ing a more conservative approach based on a higher
confidence level for the classifier.

quence of the mismatch between the training cor-
pus (edited, grammatical text) and the testing corpus
(ESL essays with errors of various kinds). When the
model was used to classify prepositions in the ESL
essays, it became obvious, almost immediately, that
a number of new performance issues would have to
be addressed.
The student essays contained many misspelled
words. Because misspellings were not in the train-
ing, the model was unable to use the features associ-
ated with them (e.g., FHword#frinzy) in its decision
making. The tagger was also affected by spelling
errors, so to avoid these problems, the classifier
was allowed to skip any context that contained mis-
spelled words in positions adjacent to the preposi-
tion or in its adjacent phrasal heads. A second prob-
lem resulted from punctuation errors in the student
writing. This usually took the form of missing com-
mas, as in I disagree because from my point of view
there is no evidence. In the training corpus, commas
generally separated parenthetical expressions, such
as from my point of view, from the rest of the sen-
tence. Without the comma, the model selected of
as the most probable preposition following because,
instead of from. A set of heuristics was used to lo-
cate common sites of comma errors and skip these
contexts.
There were two other common sources of clas-
sification error: antonyms and benefactives. The
model very often confused prepositions with op-
posite meanings (like with/without and from/to), so
when the highest probability preposition was an
antonym of the one produced by the writer, we
blocked the classifier from marking the usage as an
error. Benefactive phrases of the form for + per-
son/organization (for everyone, for my school) were
also difficult for the model to learn, most likely be-
cause, as adjuncts, they are free to appear in many
different places in a sentence and the preposition is
not constrained by its object, resulting in their fre-
quency being divided among many different con-
texts. When a benefactive appeared in an argument
position, the model’s most probable preposition was
generally not the preposition for. In the sentence
They described a part for a kid, the preposition of
has a higher probability. The classifier was pre-
vented from marking for + person/organization as
a usage error in such contexts.
To summarize, the classifier consisted of the ME
model plus a program that blocked its application

in cases of misspelling, likely punctuation errors,
antonymous prepositions, and benefactives. An-
other difference between the training corpus and the
testing corpus was that the latter contained grammat-
ical errors. In the sentence, This was my first experi-
ence about choose friends, there is a verb error im-
mediately following the preposition. Arguably, the
preposition is also wrong since the sequence about
choose is ill-formed. When the classifier marked the
preposition as incorrect in an ungrammatical con-
text, it was credited with correctly detecting a prepo-
sition error.
Next, the classifier was tested on the set of 2,000
preposition contexts, with the confidence threshold
set at 0.9. Each preposition in these essays was
judged for correctness of usage by one or two human
raters. The judged rate of occurrence of preposition
errors was 0.109 for Rater 1 and 0.098 for Rater 2,
i.e., about 1 out of every 10 prepositions was judged
to be incorrect. The overall proportion of agreement
between Rater1 and Rater 2 was 0.926, and kappa
was 0.599.
Table 3 (second column) shows the results for the
Classifier vs. Rater 1, using Rater 1 as the gold stan-
dard. Note that this is not a blind test of the clas-
sifier inasmuch as the classifier’s confidence thresh-
old was adjusted to maximize performance on this
set. The overall proportion of agreement was 0.942,
but kappa was only 0.365 due to the high level of
agreement expected by chance, as the Classifier used
the response category of “correct” more than 97%
of the time. We found similar results when com-
paring the judgements of the Classifier to Rater 2:
agreement was high and kappa was low. In addition,
for both raters, precision was much higher than re-
call. As noted earlier, the table does not include the
cases that the classifier skipped due to misspelling,
antonymous prepositions, and benefactives.
Both precision and recall are low in these com-
parisons to the human raters. We are particularly
concerned about precision because the feedback that
students receive from an automated writing analy-
sis system should, above all, avoid false positives,
i.e., marking correct usage as incorrect. We tried to
improve precision by adding to the system a naive
Bayesian classifier that uses the same features found
in Table 1. As expected, its performance is not as
good as the ME model (e.g., precision = 0.57 and
recall = 0.29 compared to Rater 1 as the gold stan-
dard), but when the Bayesian classifier was given a
veto over the decision of the ME classifier, overall
precision did increase substantially (to 0.88), though
with a reduction in recall (to 0.16). To address the
problem of low recall, we have targeted another type
of ESL preposition error: extraneous prepositions.

<bodyText confidence="0.999166566666667">
Our strategy of training the ME classifier on gram-
matical, edited text precluded detection of extrane-
ous prepositions as these did not appear in the train-
ing corpus. Of the 500-600 errors in the ESL test set,
142 were errors of this type. To identify extraneous
preposition errors we devised two rule-based filters
which were based on analysis of the development
set. Both used POS tags and chunking information.
Plural Quantifier Constructions This filter ad-
dresses the second most common extraneous prepo-
sition error where the writer has added a preposi-
tion in the middle of a plural quantifier construction,
for example: some ofpeople. This filter works by
checking if the target word is preceded by a quanti-
fier (such as “some”, “few”, or “three”), and if the
head noun of the quantifier phrase is plural. Then, if
there is no determiner in the phrase, the target word
is deemed an extraneous preposition error.
Repeated Prepositions These are cases such as
people can find friends with with the same interests
where a preposition occurs twice in a row. Repeated
prepositions were easily screened by checking if the
same lexical item and POS tag were used for both
words.
These filters address two types of extraneous
preposition errors, but there are many other types
(for example, subcategorization errors, or errors
with prepositions inserted incorrectly in the begin-
ning of a sentence initial phrase). Even though these
filters cover just one quarter of the 142 extraneous

8 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999684933333333">
We have presented a combined machine learning
and rule-based approach that detects preposition er-
rors in ESL essays with precision of 0.80 or higher
(0.796 with the ME classifier and Extraneous Prepo-
sition filters; and 0.88 with the combined ME and
Bayesian classifiers). Our work is novel in that we
are the first to report specific performance results for
a preposition error detector trained and evaluated on
general corpora.
While the training for the ME classifier was done
on a separate corpus, and it was this classifier that
contributed the most to the high precision, it should
be noted that some of the filters were tuned on the
evaluation corpus. Currently, we are in the course
of annotating additional ESL essays for preposition
errors in order to obtain a larger-sized test set.
While most NLP systems are a balancing act be-
tween precision and recall, the domain of designing
grammatical error detection systems is distinguished
in its emphasis on high precision over high recall.
Essentially, a false positive, i.e., an instance of an er-
ror detection system informing a student that a usage
is incorrect when in fact it is indeed correct, must be
reduced at the expense of a few genuine errors slip-
ping through the system undetected. Given this, we
chose to set the threshold for the system so that it en-
sures high precision which in turn resulted in a recall
figure (0.3) that leaves us much room for improve-
ment. Our plans for future system development in-
clude:
1. Using more training data. Even a cursory ex-
amination of the training corpus reveals that there
are many gaps in the data. Seven million seems
like a large number of examples, but the selection
of prepositions is highly dependent on the presence
of other specific words in the context. Many fairly
common combinations of Verb+Preposition+Noun
or Noun+Preposition+Noun are simply not attested,
even in a sizable corpus. Consistent with this, there
is a strong correlation between the relative frequency
of a preposition and the classifier’s ability to predict
its occurrence in edited text. That is, prediction is
better for prepositions that have many examples in
the training set and worse for those with fewer ex-
amples. This suggests the need for much more data.

2. Combining classifiers. Our plan is to use the

semantics of the frames in which many English
words appear.

<abstract confidence="0.9978455625">This paper presents ongoing work on the detection of preposition errors of non-native speakers of English. Since prepositions account for a substantial proportion of all grammatical errors by ESL (English as a Second Language) learners, developing an NLP application that can reliably detect these types of errors will provide an invaluable learning resource to ESL students. To address this problem, we use a maximum entropy classifier combined with rule-based filters to detect preposition errors in a corpus of student essays. Although our work is preliminary, we achieve a precision of 0.8 with a recall of 0.3.</abstract>

Eeg-Olofsson et al. (2003) used 31 handcrafted matching rules to detect extraneous, omitted, and incorrect prepositions in Swedish text written by native speakers of English, Arabic, and Japanese. The rules, which were based on the kinds of errors that were found in a training set of text produced by non-native Swedish writers, targeted spelling errors involving prepositions and some particularly problematic Swedish verbs. In a test of the system, 11 of 40 preposition errors were correctly detected. Izumi et al. (2003) and (2004) used errorannotated transcripts of Japanese speakers in an interview-based test of spoken English to train a maximum entropy classifier (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) to recognize 13 different types of grammatical and lexical errors, including errors involving prepositions. The classifier relied on lexical and syntactic features. Overall performance for the 13 error types reached 25.1% precision with 7.1% recall on an independent test set of sentences from the same source, but the researchers do not separately report the results for preposition error detection.

Usually, the predicate is expressed by a verb, but sometimes it takes the form of an adjective (He was fond of beer), a noun (They have a thirst for knowledge), or a nominalization (The child’s removal from the classroom). The choice of the preposition as an argument marker depends on the type of argument it marks, the word that fills the argument role, the particular word used as the predicate, and whether the predicate is a nominalization. Even with these constraints, there are still variations in the ways in which arguments can be expressed. Levin (1993) catalogs verb alternations such as They loaded hay on the wagon vs. They loaded the wagon with hay, which show that, depending on the verb, an argument may sometimes be marked by a preposition and sometimes not. English has hundreds of phrasal verbs, consisting of a verb and a particle (some of which are also prepositions). To complicate matters, phrasal verbs are often used with prepositions (i.e., give up on someone; give in to their demands). Phrasal verbs are particularly difficult for non-native speakers to master because of their non-compositionality of meaning, which forces the learner</context>

To detect the first type of error, incorrect selection, we have employed a maximum entropy (ME) model to estimate the probability of each of 34 prepositions, based on the features in their local contexts. The ME Principle says that the best model will satisfy the constraints found in the training, and for those situations not covered in the training, the best model will assume a distribution of maximum entropy. This approach has been shown to perform well in combining heterogeneous forms of evidence, as in word sense disambiguation (Ratnaparkhi, 1998). It also has the desirable property of handling interactions among features without having to rely on the assumption of feature independence, as in a Naive Bayesian model. Our ME model was trained on 7 million “events” consisting of an outcome (the preposition that appeared in the training text) and its associated con26 text (the set of feature-value pairs that accompanied it). These 7 million prepositions and their contexts were extracted from the MetaMetrics corpus of 1100 and 1200 Lexile text (11th and 12th grade) and newspaper text from the San Jose Mercury News.
