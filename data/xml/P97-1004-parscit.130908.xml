Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999955125">
A system for the automatic production of
controlled index terms is presented using
linguistically-motivated techniques. This
includes a finite-state part of speech tagger,
a derivational morphological processor for
analysis and generation, and a unification-
based shallow-level parser using transfor-
mational rules over syntactic patterns. The
contribution of this research is the success-
ful combination of parsing over a seed term
list coupled with derivational morphology
to achieve greater coverage of multi-word
terms for indexing and retrieval. Final re-
sults are evaluated for precision and recall,
and implications for indexing and retrieval
are discussed.

Terms are known to be excellent descriptors of the
informational content of textual documents (Sriniva-
san, 1996), but they are subject to numerous linguis-
tic variations. Terms cannot be retrieved properly
with coarse text simplification techniques (e.g. stem-
ming); their identification requires precise and effi-
cient NLP techniques. We have developed a domain
independent system for automatic term recognition
from unrestricted text. The system presented in this
paper takes as input a list of controlled terms and
a corpus; it detects and marks occurrences of term

variants within the corpus. The system takes as in-
put a precompiled (automatically or manually) term
list, and transforms it dynamically into a more com-
plete term list by adding automatically generated
variants. This method extends the limits of term
extraction as currently practiced in the IR commu-
nity: it takes into account multiple morphological
and syntactic ways linguistic concepts are expressed
within language. Our approach is a unique hybrid
in allowing the use of manually produced precom-
piled data as input, combined with fully automatic
computational methods for generating term expan-
sions. Our results indicate that we can expand term
variations at least 30% within a scientific corpus.

2 Background and Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999015">
NLP techniques have been applied to extraction
of information from corpora for tasks such as free
indexing (extraction of descriptors from corpora),
(Metzler and Haas, 1989; Schwarz, 1990; Sheridan
and Smeaton, 1992; Strzalkowski, 1996), term ac-
quisition (Smadja and McKeown, 1991; Bourigault,
1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Daille, 1996), or ex-
traction of linguistic information e.g. support verbs
(Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995), and event structure
of verbs (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992).
Although useful, these approaches suffer from two
weaknesses which we address. First is the issue of
filtering term lists; this has been dealt with by cons-
traints on processing and by post-processing over-
generated lists. Second is the problem of difficulties
in identifying related terms across parts of speech.
We address these limitations through the use of con-
trolled indexing, that is, indexing with reference to
previously available authoritative terms lists, such as
(NLM, 1995). Our approach is fully automatic, but
permits effective combination of available resources
(such as thesauri) with language processing techno-
logy, i.e., morphology, part-of-speech tagging, and
syntactic analysis.

Automatic controlled indexing is a more difficult
task than it may seem at first glance:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990562">
• controlled indexing on single-words must
account for polysemy and word disambiguation
(Krovetz and Croft, 1992; Klavans, 1995).
• controlled indexing on multi-word terms must
consider the numerous forms of term va-
riations (Dunham, Pacak, and Pratt, 1978;
Sparck Jones and Tait, 1984; Jacquemin, 1996).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999517085106383">
We focus here on the multi-word task. Our
system exploits a morphological processor and a
transformation-based parser for the extraction of
multi-word controlled indexes.
The action of the system is twofold. First, a cor-
pus is enriched by tagging each word unambiguously,
and then expanded by linking each word with all its
possible derivatives. For example, for English, the
word genes is tagged as a plural noun and morpho-
logically connected to genic, genetic, genome, ge-
notoxic, genetically, etc. Second, the term list is
dynamically expanded through syntactic transfor-
mations which allow the retrieval of term variants.
For example, genic expressions, genes were expres-
sed, expression of this gene, etc. are extracted as
variants of gene expression.
This system relies on a full-fledged unification for-
malism and thus is well adapted to a fine-grained
identification of terms related in syntactically and
morphologically complex ways. The same system
has been effectively applied both to English and
French, although this paper focuses on French (see
(Jacquemin, 1994) for the case of syntactic variants
in English). All evaluation experiments were perfor-
med on two corpora: a training corpus [ECI] (ECI,
1989 and 1990) used for the tuning of the metagram-
mar and a test corpus [AGR] (AGR, 1995) used for
evaluation. [ECI] is a subset of the European Corpus
Initiative data composed of 1.3 million words of the
French newspaper &amp;quot;Le Monde&amp;quot;; [AGR] is a set of
abstracts of scientific papers in the agricultural do-
main from /N/ST/CNRS (1.1 million words). A list
of terms is associated with each corpus: the terms
corresponding to [ECI] were automatically extrac-
ted by LEXTER (Bourigault, 1993) and the terms
corresponding to [AGR} were extracted from the
AGROVOC term list owned by INIST/CNRS.
The following section describes methods for grou-
ping multi-word term variants; Section 4 presents
a linguistically-motivated method for lexical analy-
sis (inflectional analysis, part of speech tagging, and
derivational analysis); Section 5 explains term ex-
pansion methods: constructions with a local parse
through syntactic transformations preserving depen-
dency relations; Section 6 illustrates the empirical
tuning of linguistic rules; Section 7 presents an eva-
luation of the results in terms of precision and recall.

Description of the Problem
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997335333333333">
Linguistic variation is a major concern in the studies
on automatic indexing. Variations can be classified
into three major categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997996375">
• Syntactic (Type 1): the content words of
the original term are found in the variant but
the syntactic structure of the term is modified,
e.g. technique for performing volumetric mea-
surements is a Type 1 variant of measurement
technique.
• Morpho-syntactic (Type 2): the content
words of the original term or one of their deri-
vatives are found in the variant. The syntactic
structure of the term is also modified, e.g. ele-
ctrophoresed on a neutral polyacrylamide gel is
a Type 2 variant of gel electrophoresis.
• Semantic (Type 3): synonyms are found in
the variant; the structure may be modified, e.g.
kidney function is a Type 3 variant of renal fun-
ction.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99980456">
This paper deals with Type 1 and Type 2 variations.
The two main approaches to multi-word term con-
flation in IR are text simplification and structural
similarity. Text simplification refers to traditional
IR algorithms such as (1) deletion of stop words,
(2) normalization of single words through stemming,
and (3) phrase construction through dictionary mat-
ching. (See (Lewis, Croft, and Bhandaru, 1989;
Smeaton, 1992) on the exploitation of NLP tech-
niques in IR.) These methods are generally limited.
The morphological complexity of the language seems
to be a decisive argument for performing rich stem-
ming (Popovi6 and Willett, 1992). Since we focus
on French, a language with a rich declensional infle-
ctional and derivational morphology—we have cho-
sen the richest and most precise morphological ana-
lysis. This is a key component in the recognition
of Type 2 variants. For structural similarity, co-
arse dependency-based NLP methods do not account
for fine structural relations involved in Type 1 va-
riants. For instance, properties of flour should be
linked to flour properties, properties of wheat flour
but not to properties of flour starch (examples are
from (Schwarz, 1990)). The last occurrence must be
rejected because starch is the argument of the head

noun properties, whereas flour is the argument of
the head noun properties in the original term. Wi-
thout careful structural disambiguation over internal
phrase structure, these important syntactic distinc-
tions would be incorrectly overlooked.

and Morphology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976090024390244">
First, inflectional morphology is performed in or-
der to get the different analyses of word forms. Infle-
ctional morphology is implemented with finite-state
transducers on the model used for Spanish (Tzouker-
mann and Liberman, 1990). The theoretical prin-
ciples underlying this approach are based on gene-
rative morphology (Aronoff, 1976; Selkirk, 1982).
The system consists of precomputing stems, extrac-
ted from a large dictionary of French (Boyer, 1993)
enhanced with newspaper corpora, a total of over
85,000 entries.
Second, a finite-state part of speech tagger
(Tzoukermann, Radev, and Gale, 1995; Tzouker-
mann and Radev, 1996) performs the morpho-
syntactic disambiguation of words. The tagger takes
the output of inflectional morphological analysis and
through a combination of linguistic and statistical
techniques, outputs a unique part of speech for each
word in context. Reducing the ambiguity of part of
speech tags eliminates ambiguity in local parsing.
Furthermore, part of speech ambiguity resolution
permits construction of correct derivational links.
Third, derivational morphology (Tzoukermann
and Jacquemin, 1997) is achieved to generate mor-
phological variants of the disambiguated words. De-
rivational generation is performed on the lemmas
produced by the inflectional analysis and the part of
speech information. Productive stripping and con-
catenation rules are applied on lemmas.
The derived forms are expressed as tokens with
feature structuresl. For instance, the following set
of constraints express that the noun modernisateur is
morphologically related to the word modernisation2
The &lt;ON&gt; metarule removes the -ion suffix, and
the &lt;EUR&gt; rule adds the nominal suffix -eur.
&apos;In the remainder of the paper, N is Noun, A
Adjective, C Coordinating conjunction, D Determiner,
P Preposition, Av Adverb, Pu Punctuation, NP Noun
Phrase, and AP Adjective Phrase.

The morphological analysis performed in this
study is detailed in (Tzoukermann, Klavans, and
Jacquemin, 1997). It is more complete and linguis-
tically more accurate than simple stemming for the
following reasons:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977742214285714">
• Allomorphy is accounted for by listing the set
of its possible allomorphs for each word. Al-
lomorphies are obtained through multiple verb
stems, e.g. fabriqu-, fabric- (fabricate) or addi-
tional allomorphic rules.
• Concatenation of several suffixes is accounted
for by rule ordering mechanisms. Furthermore,
we have devised a method for guessing possible
suffix combinations from a lexicon and a corpus.
This empirical method reported in (Jacquemin,
1997) ensures that suffixes which are related wi-
thin specific domains are considered.
• Derivational morphology is built with the pers-
pective of overgeneration. The nature of the se-

mantic links between a word and its derivational
forms is not checked and all allomorphic alter-
nants are generated. Selection of the correct
links occurs during subsequent term expansion
process with collocational filtering. Although
etable (cowshed) is incorrectly related to itablir
(to establish), it is very improbable to find a
context where etablir co-occurs with one of the
three words found in the three multi-word terms
containing etable: nettoyeur (cleaner), alimen-
tation (feeding), and litiere (litter): Since we
focus on multi-word term variants, overgenera-
tion does not present a problem in our system.

mar of syntactic transformations for term variants.
To discover the families of term variants, we first
consider a notion of collocation which is less restri-
ctive than variation. Then, we refine this notion in
order to filter out genuine variants and to reject spu-
rious ones. A Type 1 collocation of a binary term
is a text window containing its content words wi
and w2, without consideration of the syntactic stru-
cture. With such a definition, any Type 1 variant is
a Type 1 collocation. Similarly, a notion of Type 2
collocation is defined based on the co-occurence of
w1 and w2 including their derivational relatives.
A ±5-word window is considered as sufficient for
detecting collocations in English (Martin, Al, and
Van Sterkenburg, 1983). We chose a window-size
twice as large because French is a Romance language
with longer syntactic structures due to the absence
of compounding, and because we want to be sure
to observe structures spanning over large textual se-
quences. For example, the term perte au stockage
(storage loss) is encountered in the [AGR] corpus as:
pertes occasionnees par les ins ectes au sorgho stocke
(literally: loss of stored sorghum due to the insects).
A linguistic classification of the collocations which
are correct variants brings up the following families
of variations3.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987547904761905">
• Type 1 variations are classified according to
their syntactic stucture.
1. Coordination: a coordination the combi-
nation of two terms with a common head
word or a common argument. Thus, fruits
et agrumes tropicaux (literally: tropical ci-
trus fruits or fruits) is a coordination va-
riant of the term fruits tropicaux (tropical
fruits).
2. Substitution/Modification: a substitu-
tion is the replacement of a content word
by a term; a modification is the insertion
of a modifier without reference to another
term. For example, activite thermodyna-
migue de l&apos;eau (thermodynamic activity of
water) is a substitution variant of activite
de l&apos;eau (activity of water) if activite ther-
modynamique (thermodynamic activity) is
a term; otherwise, it is a modification.

French, most terms have a compound noun

transformation of a term with a compound
structure into a noun phrase structure such
as consommation de l&apos;oxygene (consump-
tion of the oxygen). Compounding is the
reciprocal transformation.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97513605">
• Type 2 variations are classified according to
the nature of the morphological derivation. Of-
ten semantic shifts are involved as well (Viegas,
Gonzalez, and Longwell, 1996).
1. Noun-Noun variations: relations such
as result/agent (fixation de l&apos;azote (ni-
trogen fixation)/fixateurs d&apos;azote (nitrogen
fixater)) or container/content (reservoir
d&apos;eau (water reservoir)/reserve en eau (wa-
ter reserve)) are found in this family.
2. Noun-Verb variations: these variations
often involve semantic shifts such as pro-
cess/result fixation de l&apos;azotel fixer l&apos;azote
(to fix nitrogen).
3. Noun-Adjective variations: the two
ways to modify a noun, a prepositional
phrase or an adjectival phrase, are gene-
rally semantically equivalent, e.g. variation
du c/imat (climate variation) is a synonym
of variation climatique (climatic variation).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9869451">
A method for term variant extraction based on
morphology and simple co-occurrences would be
very imprecise. A manual observation of collocations
shows that only 55% of the Type 1 collocations are
correct Type 1 variants and that only 52% of the
Type 2 collocations are correct Type 2 variants. It
is therefore necessary to conceive a filtering method
for rejecting fortuitous co-occurrences. The follo-
wing section proposes a filtering system based on
syntactic patterns.

6.1 Syntactic Transformations for Type 1
and Type 2 variants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982625">
The concept of a grammar of syntactic transforma-
tions is motivated by well-known observations on the
behavior of collocations in context (e.g. (Harris et
al., 1989).) Initial rules based on surface syntax are
refined through incremental experimental tuning.
We have devised a grammar of French to serve as a
basis for the creation of metarules for term variants.
For example, the noun phrase expansion rule is4:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.516887">
NP D7 AP* N (AP PP)* (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.7648085">
&apos;We use UNIX regular expression symbols for rules
and transformations.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993333">
27
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.925846">
From this rule a set of expansions can be generated:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9962925">
NP = D? (Av? A)* N (Av? A (2)
P D? (Av? A)* N (Av? A)*)*
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999834">
In order to balance completeness and accuracy, ex-
pansions are limited. After the initial expansion is
created for a range of structures, empirical tuning is
applied to create a set of maximum coverage meta-
rules.
We briefly illustrate this process for coordina-
tion. For this example, we restrict transformations
to terms with N P N structures which represent a full
33% of the binary terms. Examples of metarules of
Type 1 and Type 2 variations are given in Table 1.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.8928785">
6.2 Development of a Coordination
Transformation for NP N Terms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993855">
The coordination types are first calculated by combi-
ning the pattern Ni P2 N3 with possible expansions
of a noun phrase with a simple paradigmatic struc-
ture A? N (A I P A? N A?)5:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9997825">
Coord(Ni P2 N3) = NI ((C A? N A? P) (3)
(A C P) I (P D? A? N A? C P?)) N3
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953076923077">
The first parenthesis (C A? N A? P) represents a
coordinated head noun, the second (A C P) and
third (P D? A? N A? C P?) represent respectively
an adjective phrase and a prepositional phrase coor-
dinated with the prepositional phrase of the original
term.
Variants were extracted on the [ECI] corpus
through this transformation; the following observa-
tions and changes have been made.
First, coordination accepts a substitution which
replaces the noun N3 with a noun phrase D? A? N3.
For example, the variant temperature et humidite
initia/e de l&apos; air (temperature and initial humidity of
the air) is a coordination where a determiner pre-
cedes the last noun (air).
Secondly, the observations of coordination va-
riants also suggest that the coordinating conjunction
can be preceded by an optional comma and followed
by an optional adverb, e.g. la production, et sur-
tout la diffusion des semences (the production, and
particularly the distribution of the seeds).
Thirdly, variants such as de Phumidite et de la
vitesse de Pair (literally: of humidity and of the
speed of the air) indicate that the conjunction can be
followed by an optional preposition and an optional
determiner.

The three preceding changes are made on the ex-

given in the first line of Table 1 (changes are under-
lined).
Our empirical selection of valid metarules is gui-
ded by linguistic considerations and corpus observa-
tions. This mode of grammar conception has led us
to the following decisions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99152675">
• reject linguistic phenomena which could not be
accounted for by regular expressions such as
sentential complements of nouns;
• reject noisy and inaccurate variations such as
long distance dependencies (specifically within
a verb phrase);
• focus on productive and safe variations which
are felicitously represented in our framework.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995396375">
Accounting for variants which are not considered in
our framework would require the conception of a no-
vel framework, probably in cooperation with a dee-
per analyzer. It is unlikely that our transformatio-
nal approach with regular expressions could do much
better than the results presented here. Table 2 shows
some variants of AGROVOC terms extracted from

The precision and recall of the extraction of term va-
riants are given in Table 4 where precision is the ra-
tio of correct variants among the variants extracted
and the recall is the ratio of variants retrieved among
the collocates. Results were obtained through a ma-
nual inspection of 1,579 Type 1 variants, 823 Type 2
variants, 3,509 Type 1 collocates, and 2,104 Type 2
collocates extracted from the [AGR) corpus and the
AGROVOC term list.
These results indicate a very high level of accu-
racy: 89.4% of the variants extracted by the system
are correct ones. Errors generally correspond to a se-
mantic discrepancy between a word and its morpho-
logically derived form. For example, elevee pour un
sol (literally: high for a soil) is not a correct variant
of elevage hors sol (off-soil breeding) because elevee
and elevage are morphologically related to two dif-
ferent senses of the verb eleven elevee derives from
the meaning to raise whereas elevage derives from to
breed. Recall is weaker than precision because only
75.2% of the possible variants are retrieved.

Both indexings have been manually checked. Simple
indexing is almost error-free but does not cover term
variants. On the contrary, rich indexing is slightly
less accurate but recall is much higher. Both me-
thods are compared by calculating the effectiveness
measure (Van Rijsbergen, 1975):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.826197">
Ea = 1 with 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 (4)
a 1 + (1 — a) (*)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.986313263157895">
P and R are precision and recall and a is a para-
meter which is close to 1 if precision is preferred to
recall. The value of Ea varies from 0 to 1; Ea is
close to 0 when all the relevant conflations are made
and when no incorrect one is made.
The effectiveness of rich indexing is more than
three times better than effectiveness of simple in-
dexing. Retrieved variants increase the number
of indexing items by 28.8% (17.3% Type 1 va-
riants and 11.5% Type 2 variants). Thus, term va-
riant extraction is a significant expansion factor for
identifying morphologically and syntactically related
multi-word terms in a document without introducing
undesirable noise.
As for performance, the parser is fast enough for
processing large amounts of textual data due to the
presence of several optimization devices. On a Pen-
tium133 with Linux, the parser processes 18,100
words/min from an initial list of 4,300 terms.

In using a list of controlled terms coupled with a
syntactic analyzer, the method is more precise than
traditional text simplification methods. Iterative ex-
perimental tuning has resulted in wide-coverage lin-
guistic description incorporating the most frequent
linguistic phenomena.
Evaluations indicate that, by accounting for term
variation using corpus tagging, morphological deri-
vation, and transformation-based rules, 28.8% more
can be identified than with a traditional indexer
which cannot account for variation. Applications to
be explored in future research involve the incorpo-
ration of the system as part of the indexing module
of an IR system, to be able to accurately measure
improvements in system coverage as well as areas of
possible degradation. We also plan to explore analy-
sis of semantic variants through a predicative repre-
sentation of term semantics. Our results so far indi-
cate that using computational linguistic techniques
for carefully controlled term expansion will permit
at least a three-fold expansion for coverage over tra-
ditional indexing, which should improve retrieval re-
sults accordingly.

<abstract confidence="0.994382113207547">A system for the automatic production of controlled index terms is presented using linguistically-motivated techniques. This includes a finite-state part of speech tagger, a derivational morphological processor for analysis and generation, and a unificationbased shallow-level parser using transformational rules over syntactic patterns. The contribution of this research is the successful combination of parsing over a seed term list coupled with derivational morphology to achieve greater coverage of multi-word terms for indexing and retrieval. Final results are evaluated for precision and recall, and implications for indexing and retrieval are discussed. 1 Motivation Terms are known to be excellent descriptors of the informational content of textual documents (Srinivasan, 1996), but they are subject to numerous linguistic variations. Terms cannot be retrieved properly with coarse text simplification techniques (e.g. stemming); their identification requires precise and efficient NLP techniques. We have developed a domain independent system for automatic term recognition from unrestricted text. The system presented in this paper takes as input a list of controlled terms and a corpus; it detects and marks occurrences of term like to thank the NLP Group of Columbia University, Bell Laboratories - Lucent Technologies, and the Institut Universitaire de Technologie de Nantes for their support of the exchange visitor program for the first author.

The system takes as input a precompiled (automatically or manually) term list, and transforms it dynamically into a more complete term list by adding automatically generated variants. This method extends the limits of term as currently practiced in the community: it takes into account multiple morphological and syntactic ways linguistic concepts are expressed within language. Our approach is a unique hybrid in allowing the use of manually produced precompiled data as input, combined with fully automatic computational methods for generating term expansions. Our results indicate that we can expand term variations at least 30% within a scientific corpus.</abstract>

Our results indicate that we can expand term variations at least 30% within a scientific corpus. 2 Background and Introduction NLP techniques have been applied to extraction of information from corpora for tasks such as free indexing (extraction of descriptors from corpora), (Metzler and Haas, 1989; Schwarz, 1990; Sheridan and Smeaton, 1992; Strzalkowski, 1996), term acquisition (Smadja and McKeown, 1991; Bourigault, 1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Daille, 1996), or extraction of linguistic information e.g. support verbs (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995), and event structure of verbs (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992). Although useful, these approaches suffer from two weaknesses which we address. First is the issue of filtering term lists; this has been dealt with by constraints on processing and by post-processing overgenerated lists. Second is the problem of difficulties in identifying related terms across parts of speech. We address these limitations through the use of controlled indexing, that is, indexing with reference to previously available authorita</context>

Our approach is fully automatic, but permits effective combination of available resources (such as thesauri) with language processing technology, i.e., morphology, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis. 24 Automatic controlled indexing is a more difficult task than it may seem at first glance: • controlled indexing on single-words must account for polysemy and word disambiguation (Krovetz and Croft, 1992; Klavans, 1995). • controlled indexing on multi-word terms must consider the numerous forms of term variations (Dunham, Pacak, and Pratt, 1978; Sparck Jones and Tait, 1984; Jacquemin, 1996). We focus here on the multi-word task. Our system exploits a morphological processor and a transformation-based parser for the extraction of multi-word controlled indexes. The action of the system is twofold. First, a corpus is enriched by tagging each word unambiguously, and then expanded by linking each word with all its possible derivatives. For example, for English, the word genes is tagged as a plural noun and morphologically connected to genic, genetic, genome, genotoxic, genetically, etc. Second, the term list is dynamically expanded throu</context>

For example, genic expressions, genes were expressed, expression of this gene, etc. are extracted as variants of gene expression. This system relies on a full-fledged unification formalism and thus is well adapted to a fine-grained identification of terms related in syntactically and morphologically complex ways. The same system has been effectively applied both to English and French, although this paper focuses on French (see (Jacquemin, 1994) for the case of syntactic variants in English). All evaluation experiments were performed on two corpora: a training corpus [ECI] (ECI, 1989 and 1990) used for the tuning of the metagrammar and a test corpus [AGR] (AGR, 1995) used for evaluation.

A manual observation of collocations shows that only 55% of the Type 1 collocations are correct Type 1 variants and that only 52% of the Type 2 collocations are correct Type 2 variants. It is therefore necessary to conceive a filtering method for rejecting fortuitous co-occurrences. The following section proposes a filtering system based on syntactic patterns. 6 Empirical Rule Tuning 6.1 Syntactic Transformations for Type 1 and Type 2 variants The concept of a grammar of syntactic transformations is motivated by well-known observations on the behavior of collocations in context (e.g. (Harris et al., 1989).) Initial rules based on surface syntax are refined through incremental experimental tuning. We have devised a grammar of French to serve as a basis for the creation of metarules for term variants. For example, the noun phrase expansion rule is4: NP D7 AP* N (AP PP)* (1) &apos;We use UNIX regular expression symbols for rules and transformations. 27 From this rule a set of expansions can be generated: NP = D? (Av? A)* N (Av? A (2) P D? (Av? A)* N (Av? A)*)* In order to balance completeness and accuracy, expansions are limited. After the initial expansion is created for a range of structures, empiri</context>

For example, genic expressions, genes were expressed, expression of this gene, etc. are extracted as variants of gene expression. This system relies on a full-fledged unification formalism and thus is well adapted to a fine-grained identification of terms related in syntactically and morphologically complex ways. The same system has been effectively applied both to English and French, although this paper focuses on French (see (Jacquemin, 1994) for the case of syntactic variants in English). All evaluation experiments were performed on two corpora: a training corpus [ECI] (ECI, 1989 and 1990) used for the tuning of the metagrammar and a test corpus [AGR] (AGR, 1995) used for evaluation. [ECI] is a subset of the European Corpus Initiative data composed of 1.3 million words of the French newspaper &amp;quot;Le Monde&amp;quot;; [AGR] is a set of abstracts of scientific papers in the agricultural domain from /N/ST/CNRS (1.1 million words).

Our approach is fully automatic, but permits effective combination of available resources (such as thesauri) with language processing technology, i.e., morphology, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis. 24 Automatic controlled indexing is a more difficult task than it may seem at first glance: • controlled indexing on single-words must account for polysemy and word disambiguation (Krovetz and Croft, 1992; Klavans, 1995). • controlled indexing on multi-word terms must consider the numerous forms of term variations (Dunham, Pacak, and Pratt, 1978; Sparck Jones and Tait, 1984; Jacquemin, 1996). We focus here on the multi-word task. Our system exploits a morphological processor and a transformation-based parser for the extraction of multi-word controlled indexes. The action of the system is twofold. First, a corpus is enriched by tagging each word unambiguously, and then expanded by linking each word with all its possible derivatives. For example, for English, the word genes is tagged as a plural noun and morphologically connected to genic, genetic, genome, genotoxic, genetically, etc. Second, the term list is dynamically expanded through syntactic transformations which allow the re</context>

Second, a finite-state part of speech tagger (Tzoukermann, Radev, and Gale, 1995; Tzoukermann and Radev, 1996) performs the morphosyntactic disambiguation of words. The tagger takes the output of inflectional morphological analysis and through a combination of linguistic and statistical techniques, outputs a unique part of speech for each word in context. Reducing the ambiguity of part of speech tags eliminates ambiguity in local parsing. Furthermore, part of speech ambiguity resolution permits construction of correct derivational links. Third, derivational morphology (Tzoukermann and Jacquemin, 1997) is achieved to generate morphological variants of the disambiguated words. Derivational generation is performed on the lemmas produced by the inflectional analysis and the part of speech information. Productive stripping and concatenation rules are applied on lemmas. The derived forms are expressed as tokens with feature structuresl. For instance, the following set of constraints express that the noun modernisateur is morphologically related to the word modernisation2 The &lt;ON&gt; metarule removes the -ion suffix, and the &lt;EUR&gt; rule adds the nominal suffix -eur. &apos;In the remainder of the paper, N </context>

It is more complete and linguistically more accurate than simple stemming for the following reasons: • Allomorphy is accounted for by listing the set of its possible allomorphs for each word. Allomorphies are obtained through multiple verb stems, e.g. fabriqu-, fabric- (fabricate) or additional allomorphic rules. • Concatenation of several suffixes is accounted for by rule ordering mechanisms. Furthermore, we have devised a method for guessing possible suffix combinations from a lexicon and a corpus. This empirical method reported in (Jacquemin, 1997) ensures that suffixes which are related within specific domains are considered. • Derivational morphology is built with the perspective of overgeneration. The nature of the semantic links between a word and its derivational forms is not checked and all allomorphic alternants are generated. Selection of the correct links occurs during subsequent term expansion process with collocational filtering. Although etable (cowshed) is incorrectly related to itablir (to establish), it is very improbable to find a context where etablir co-occurs with one of the three words found in the three multi-word t</context>

Since we focus on French, a language with a rich declensional inflectional and derivational morphology—we have chosen the richest and most precise morphological analysis. This is a key component in the recognition of Type 2 variants. For structural similarity, coarse dependency-based NLP methods do not account for fine structural relations involved in Type 1 variants. For instance, properties of flour should be linked to flour properties, properties of wheat flour but not to properties of flour starch (examples are from (Schwarz, 1990)). The last occurrence must be rejected because starch is the argument of the head 25 noun properties, whereas flour is the argument of the head noun properties in the original term.

This paper deals with Type 1 and Type 2 variations. The two main approaches to multi-word term conflation in IR are text simplification and structural similarity. Text simplification refers to traditional IR algorithms such as (1) deletion of stop words, (2) normalization of single words through stemming, and (3) phrase construction through dictionary matching. (See (Lewis, Croft, and Bhandaru, 1989; Smeaton, 1992) on the exploitation of NLP techniques in IR.) These methods are generally limited. The morphological complexity of the language seems to be a decisive argument for performing rich stemming (Popovi6 and Willett, 1992). Since we focus on French, a language with a rich declensional inflectional and derivational morphology—we have chosen the richest and most precise morphological analysis. This is a key component in the recognition of Type 2 variants. For structural similarity, coarse dependency-based NLP methods do not account for fine structural relations involved in Type 1 variants.

The contribution of this research is the successful combination of parsing over a seed term list coupled with derivational morphology to achieve greater coverage of multi-word terms for indexing and retrieval. Final results are evaluated for precision and recall, and implications for indexing and retrieval are discussed. 1 Motivation Terms are known to be excellent descriptors of the informational content of textual documents (Srinivasan, 1996), but they are subject to numerous linguistic variations. Terms cannot be retrieved properly with coarse text simplification techniques (e.g. stemming); their identification requires precise and efficient NLP techniques. We have developed a domain independent system for automatic term recognition from unrestricted text. The system presented in this paper takes as input a list of controlled terms and a corpus; it detects and marks occurrences of term We would like to thank the NLP Group of Columbia University, Bell Laboratories - Lucent Technologies, and the Institut Universitaire de Technologi</context>

Second, a finite-state part of speech tagger (Tzoukermann, Radev, and Gale, 1995; Tzoukermann and Radev, 1996) performs the morphosyntactic disambiguation of words. The tagger takes the output of inflectional morphological analysis and through a combination of linguistic and statistical techniques, outputs a unique part of speech for each word in context. Reducing the ambiguity of part of speech tags eliminates ambiguity in local parsing. Furthermore, part of speech ambiguity resolution permits construction of correct derivational links. Third, derivational morphology (Tzoukermann and Jacquemin, 1997) is achieved to generate morphological variants of the disambiguated words. Derivational generation is performed on the lemmas produced by the inflectional analysis and the part of speech information. Productive stripping and concatenation rules are applied on lemmas. The derived forms are expressed as tokens with feature structuresl. For instance, the following set of constraints express that the noun modernisateur is morphologically related to the word modernisation2 The &lt;ON&gt; metarule removes the -ion suffix, and the &lt;EUR&gt; rule adds the nominal suffix -eur. &apos;In the remainder of the paper, N </context>

It is more complete and linguistically more accurate than simple stemming for the following reasons: • Allomorphy is accounted for by listing the set of its possible allomorphs for each word. Allomorphies are obtained through multiple verb stems, e.g. fabriqu-, fabric- (fabricate) or additional allomorphic rules. • Concatenation of several suffixes is accounted for by rule ordering mechanisms. Furthermore, we have devised a method for guessing possible suffix combinations from a lexicon and a corpus.
