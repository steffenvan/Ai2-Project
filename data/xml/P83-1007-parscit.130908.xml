1. Overview

<bodyText confidence="0.956058078947369">
Linguistic theories typically assign various linguistic
phenomena to one of the categories, syntactic, semantic,
or pragmatic, as if the phenomena in each category were
relatively independent of those in the others. However,
various phenomena in discourse do not seem to yield
comfortably to any account that is strictly a syntactic or
semantic or pragmatic one. This paper focuses on
particular phenomena of this sort—the use of various
referring expressions such as definite noun phrases and
pronouns—and examines their interaction with
mechanisms used to maintain discourse coherence.
Even a casual survey of the literature on definite
descriptions and referring expressions reveals not only
defects in the individual accounts provided by theorists
(from several different disciplines), but also deep
confusions about the roles that syntactic, semantic, and
pragmatic factors play in accounting for these
phenomena. The research we have undertaken is an
attempt to sort out some of these confusions and to create
the basis for a theoretical framework that can account for
a variety of discourse phenomena in which all three
factors of language use interact. The major premise on
which our research depends is that the concepts necessary
for an adequate understanding of the phenomena in
question are not exclusively either syntactic or semantic
or pragmatic.
The next section of this paper defines two levels of
discourse coherence and describes their roles in accounting
for the use of singular definite noun phrases. To illustrate
the integration of factors in explaining the uses of
referring expressions, their use on one of these levels, i.e.,
the local one, is discussed in Sections 3 and 4. This
account requires introducing the notion of the centers of a
sentence in a discourse, a notion that cannot be defined in
terms of factors that are exclusively syntactic or semantic
or pragmatic. In Section 5, the interactions of the two
levels with these factors and their effects on the uses of
referring expressions in discourse are discussed.

2. The Effects of Different Levels of Discourse
Coherence
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999370028571428">
A discourse comprises utterances that combine into
subconstituents of the discourse, namely, units of
discourse that are typically larger than a single sentence,
but smaller than the complete discourse. However, the
constituent structure is not determined solely by the
linear sequence of utterances. It is common for two
contiguous utterances to be members of different
subconstituents of the discourse (as with breaks between
phrases in the syntactic analysis of a sentence); likewise, it
is common for two utterances that are not contiguous to
be members of the same subconstituent.
An individual subconstituent of a discourse exhibits both
internal coherence and coherence with the other
subconstituents. That is, discourses have been shown to
have two levels of coherence. Global coherence refers to
the ways in which the larger segments of discourse relate
to one another. It depends on such things as the function
of a discourse, its subject matter, and rhetorical schema
(Grosz, 1977, 1981; Reichman, 19811. Local coherence
refers to the ways in which individual sentences bind
together to form larger discourse segments. It depends on
such things as the syntactic structure of an utterance,
ellipsis, and the use of pronominal referring expressions
1Sidner, 19811.
The two levels of discourse coherence correspond to two
levels of focusing—global focusing and centering.
Participants are said to be globally focused on a set of
entities relevant to the overall discourse. These entities
may either have been explicitly introduced into the
discourse or be sufficiently closely related to such entities
to be considered implicitly in focus [Grosz, 19811. In
contrast. centering refers to a more local focusing process,
one relates to identifying the single entity that an
individual utterance most centrally concerns (Sidner,
1979; Joshi and Weinstein, 19811.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99844">

<bodyText confidence="0.996783076923077">
The two levels of focusing/coherence have different
effects on the processing of pronominal and
nonpronominal definite noun phrases. Global coherence
and focusing are major factors in the generation and
interpretation of nonpronominal definite referring
expressions.- Local coherence and centering have greater
effect on the processing of pronominal expressions. In
Section 5 we shall describe the rules governing the use of
these kinds of expressions and shall explain why
additional processing by the hearer (needed for drawing
additional inferences) is involved when pronominal
expressions are used to refer to globally focused entities or
nonpronominal expressions are used to refer to centered
entities.
Many approaches to language interpretation have
ignored these differences, depending instead on powerful
inference mechanisms to identify the referents of referring
expressions. Although such approaches may suffice,
especially for well-formed texts, they are insufficient in
general. In particular, such approaches will not work for
generation. Here the relationships among focusing,
coherence, and referring expressions are essential and
must be explicitly provided for. Theories—and systems
based on them--will generate unacceptable uses of
referring expressions if they do not take these
relationships into account.3

3. Centering and Anaphora
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999748782608696">
In our theory, the centers of a sentence in a discourse
serve to integrate that sentence into the discourse. Each
sentence, S, has a single backward-looking center, Cb(S),
and a set of forward-looking centers, Cf(S). Cb(S) serves
to link S to the preceding discourse, while Cf(S) provides
a set of entities to which the succeeding discourse may be
linked. To avoid confusion, the phrase &apos;the center&apos; will
he used to refer only to Cb(S).
To clarify the notion of center, we will consider a
number of discourses illustrating the various factors that
are combined in its definition (abstractly) and in its
identification in a discourse. In Section 5 we define center
more precisely, show how it relates to Sidner&apos;s [19811
immediate focus and potential foci, and discuss how the
linkages established by the centers of a sentence help to
determine the degree of intelligibility of a discourse. We
begin by showing that the center cannot be defined in
syntactic terms alone. The interaction of semantics and
centering is more complex and is discussed in Section 4.
The following examples, drawn from Reinhart [19821,
illustrate the point that the notion of center is not
syntactically definable,4 i.e., the syntax of a sentence S
does not determine which of its NPs realizes Cb(S). (The

<bodyText confidence="0.959897909090909">
Although (lb) and (2b) are identical, Cb(lb) is Max and
Cb(2b) is Rosa. This can be seen in part by noticing that
&apos;He saw Rosa&apos; seems more natural than (Ib) and *Max
saw her&apos; than (2b) (a fact consistent with the centering
rule introduced in Section 5.) The subject NP is the
center in one context, the object NP in the other.
Even when the NP used to realize Cb(S) can be
syntactically determined, the Cb(S) itself is not yet fully
determined, for Cb(S) is typically not a linguistic entity
(i.e., it is not a particular linguistic expression). Rosa, not
&apos;Rosa&apos; is the Cb(2b). Consider. the discourse:

Here, Cb(3c) is Rosa, but clearly would not be in other

most simply by considering the discourse that would
result if &amp;quot;How is Joan?&apos; replaced (3a). In the discourse

4. Centering and Realization
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999858466666667">
The interactions of semantic and pragmatic factors with
centering and their effects on referring expressions are
more complex than the preceding discussion suggests. In
the examples given above, the NPs that realize Cb(S) also
denote it, but this is not always the case: we used the
term &apos;realize&apos; in the above discussion advisedly. In this
section, we consider two kinds of examples in which the
center of a sentence is not simply the denotation of some
noun phrase occurring in the sentence. First, we will
examine several examples in which the choice of and
interaction among different kinds of interpretations of
definite noun phrases are affected by the local discourse
context (i.e., centering). Second, the role of pragmatic
factors in some problematic cases of referential uses of
definite descriptions [Donnellan 19661 is discussed.

4.1. Realization and Value-Free and Value-Loaded
Interpretations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999716">
The distinction between realization and semantic
denotation is necessary to treat the interaction between
value-free and value-loaded interpretations [Barwise and
Perry, 19821 of definite descriptions, as they occur in
extended discourse. Consider, for example, the following
sequence:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994392">
145
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.948887131578947">
(4a) The vice president of the United States
is also president of the Senate.
(4b) Historically, he is the president&apos;s key
man in negotiations with Congress.
(4b&apos;) As Ambassador to China, he handled
aany tricky negotiations, so he is
well prepared for this job.
Cb(4b) and Cb(4b&apos;) are each realized by the anaphoric
element &apos;he.&apos; But (4b) expresses the same thing as
&apos;Historically, the vice president of the United States is
the president&apos;s key man in negotiations with Congress&apos;
(in which it is clear that no single individual vice
president is being referred to) whereas (4b1 expresses the
same thing as, &apos;As ambassador to China, the [person who
is now] vice president of the United States handled many
tricky negotiations,...&apos; This can be accounted for by
observing that &apos;the vice president of the United States&apos;
contributes both its value-free interpretation and its
value-loading at the world type to Cf(4a). Cb(4b) is then
the value-free interpretation and Cb(4b&apos;) is the value-
loading, i.e., George Bush.
In this example, both value-free and value-loaded
interpretations are shown to stern from the same full
definite noun phrase. It is also possible for the movement
of the center from a value-free interpretation (for Cb(S))
to a value-loaded interpretation (for Cb of the next
sentence)--or vice versa—to be accomplished solely with
pronouns. That is, although (4b)-(4b1 is (at least for
some readers) not a natural dialogue, similar sequences
are possible.
There appear to be strong constraints on the kinds of
transitions that are allowed. In particular, if a given
sentence forces either the value-free or value-loaded
interpretation, then only that interpretation becomes
possible in a subsequent sentence. However, if some
sentence in a given context merely prefers one
interpretation while allowing the other, then either one is
possible in a subsequent sentence.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.919716">
For example, the sequence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.949535212121212">
(6a) The vice president of the United States
is also president of the Senate.
(5b) He&apos;s the president&apos;s key aan in negotiations
vith Congress.
in which &apos;he&apos; may be interpreted as either value-free
(IT) or value-loaded (VL), may be followed by either of
the following two sentences:
(Sc) As ambassador to China, he
handled zany tricky negotiations. (VL)
(Sc&apos;) He is required to be at least 36 years old. (VF)
However, if we change (5b) to force the value-loaded
interpretation, as in (5b&amp;quot;), then only (5c) is possible.
(Sb&apos;) Right now he is the president&apos;s
key man in negotiations with Congress.
Similarly, if (5b) is changed to force the value-free
interpretation, as in (4b), then only (5c&apos;) is possible.
If an intermediate sentence allows both interpretations
but prefers one in a given context, then either is possible
in the third sentence. A use with preference for a value-
loaded interpretation followed by a use indicating the
value-free interpretation is illustrated in the sequence:
John thinks that the telephone is a toy.
He plays with it every day. (11 preferred; VT. ok)
He doesn&apos;t realize that it is an invention
that changed the world. (VF)
The preference for a value-free interpretation that is
followed by a value-loaded one is easiest to see in a
dialogue situation;
sl. The vice president of the United States
is also president of the Senate.
s2: I thought he played some
important role in the House. (VF preferred; VL ok)
SI: He did, but that was before he was VP. (W.)

4.2. Realization and Referential Use
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993733555555555">
From these examples, it might appear that the concepts
of value-free and value-loaded interpretation are identical
to DonneIlan&apos;s 119661 attributive and referential uses of
noun phrases. However, there is an important difference
between these two distinctions. The importance to our
theory is that the referential use of definite noun phrases
introduces the need to take pragmatic factors (in
particular speaker intention) into account, not just
semantic factors.
Donnellan [1966] describes the referential and
attributive uses of definite descriptions in the following
way:
&apos;A speaker who uses a definite description
attributively in an assertion states something
about whoever or whatever is the so-and-so. A
speaker who uses a definite description
referentially in an assertion, on the other hand,
uses the description to enable his audience to
pick out whom or what he is talking about and
states something about that person or thing. In
the first case the definite description might be
said to occur essentially, for the speaker wishes
to assert something about whatever or whoever
fits that description; but in the referential use
the definite description is merely one tool for
doing a certain job--calling attention to a person
or thing--and in general any other device for
doing the same job, another description or a
name, would do as well. In the attributive use,
the attribute of being the so-and-so is all
important, while it is not in the referential use.&apos;
The distinction Donnellan suggests can be formulated in
terms of the different propositions a sentence S containing
a definite description D may be used to express on
different occasions of use. When D is used referentially, it
contributes its denotation to the proposition expressed by
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996959">
46
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.954943096774194">
S; when it is used attributively, it contributes to the
proposition expressed by S a semantic interpretation
related to the descriptive content of D. The identity of
this semantic interpretation is not something about which
Donnellan is explicit. Distinct formal treatments of the
semantics of definite descriptions in natural language
would construe the appropriate interpretation differently.
In semantic treatments based on possible worlds, the
appropriate interpretation would be a (partial) function
from possible worlds to objects; in the situation semantics
expounded by Barwise and Perry, the appropriate
interpretation is a (partial) function from resource
situations5 to objects.
As just described, the referential-attributive distinction
appears to be exactly the distinction that Barwise and
Perry formulate in terms of the value-loaded and value-
free interpretations of definite noun phrases. But this
gloss omits an essential aspect of the referential-
attributive distinction as elaborated by Donnellan. In
DonneIlan&apos;s view, a speaker may use a description
referentially to refer to an object distinct from the
semantic denotation of the description, and, moreover, to
refer to an object even when the description has no
semantic denotation.
In one sense, this phenomenon arises within the
framework of Barwise and Perry&apos;s treatment of
descriptions. If we understand the semantic denotation of
a description to be the unique object that satisfies the
content of the description, if there is one, then Barwise
and Perry would allow that there are referential uses of a
description D that contribute objects other than the
semantic denotation of D to the propositions expressed by
uses of sentences in which D occurs. But this is only
because Barwise and Perry allow that a description may
be evaluated at a resource situation other than the
complete situation in order to arrive at its denotation on
a given occasion of use. Still, the denotation of the
description relative to a given resource situation is the
unique object in the situation that satisfies the description
relative to that situation.
The referential uses of descriptions that Donnellan gives
examples of do not seem to arise by evaluation of
descriptions at alternative resource situations, but rather
through the *referential intentions&apos; of the speaker in his
use of the description. This aspect of referential use is a
pragmatic rather than a semantic phenomenon and is best
analyzed in terms of the distinction between semantic
reference and speaker&apos;s reference elaborated in Kripke
[10771.
Consider the following discourses drawn from Kripke
[10771:
5Roughly, &apos;any situation on which the speaker can focus
attention is a potential candidate for a resource situation with
respect to which the speaker may value load his uses of definite
descriptions. Such resource situations must contain a unique object
which satisfies the description.
(6a) Her husband is kind to her.
(61)) NO. he isn&apos;t. The can you&apos;re
referring to isn&apos;t her husband.
(7a) Her husband is kind to her.
(7b) He is kind to her but he isn&apos;t her husband.
With (6a) and (7a), Kripke has in mind a case like the
one discussed in Donnellan [19661, in which a speaker uses
a description to refer to something other than the
semantic referent of that description, i.e., the unique thing
that satisfies the description (if there is one). Kripke
analyzes this case as an instance of the general
phenomenon of a clash of intentions in language use. In
the case at hand, the speaker has a general intention to
use the description to refer to its semantic referent; his
specific intention, distinct from his general semantic
intention, is to use it to refer to a particular individual.
He incorrectly believes that these two intentions coincide
and this gives rise to a use of the referring expression &apos;her
husband&amp;quot; in which the speaker&apos;s reference and the
semantic reference are distinct.•6 (The speaker&apos;s referent
is presumably the woman&apos;s lover).
From our point of view, the importance of the case
resides in its showing that Cf(S) may include more than
one entity, that is realized by a single NP in S. In this
case, &apos;her husband&apos; contributes both the husband and
the lover to Cf(6a) and Cf(7a). This can be seen by
observing that both discourses seem equally appropriate
and that the backward-looking centers of (6b) and (7b)
are the husband and the lover, respectively, realized by
their anaphoric elements. Hence, the forward-looking
centers of a sentence may be related not semantically but
pragmatically to the NPs that realize them.
Hence, the importance of the referential/attributive
distinction from our point of view is that it leads to cases
in which the centers of a sentence may be pragmatically
rather than semantically related to the noun phrases that
realize them.

5. Center Movement and Center Realization--
Constraints
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897333333334">
En the foregoing sections we have discussed a number of
examples to illustrate two essential points. First, the noun
phrase that realizes the backward-looking center of an
utterance in a discourse cannot be determined from the
syntax of the utterance alone. Second, the relation N
realizes c between noun phrases N and centers c is
neither solely a semantic nor solely a pragmatic relation.
This discussion has proceeded at a rather intuitive level,
without explicit elaboration of the framework we regard
as appropriate for dealing with centering and its role in
explaining discourse phenomena. Before going on to
describe constraints on the realization relation that
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.665635166666667">
6There are, of course, several alternative explanations; e.g., the
speaker may believe that the description is more likely than an
accurate one to be interpreted correctly by the hearer. Ferreting out
exactly what the case is in a given situation requires accounts of
mutual belief and the like. A discussion of these issues is beyond the
scope of this paper.

<bodyText confidence="0.974215416666667">
explain certain phenomena in discourse, we should be
somewhat more explicit about the notions of center and
realization.
We have said that each utterance S in a discourse has
associated with it a backward-looking center, Cb(S), and
a set of forward-looking centers, Cf(S). What manner of
objects are these centers? They are the sort of objects
that can serve as the semantic interpretations of singular
noun phrases.7 That is, either they are objects in the
world (e.g., planets, people, numbers) or they are
functions from possible worlds (situations, etc.) to objects
in the world that can be used to interpret definite
descriptions. That is, whatever serves to interpret a
definite noun phrase can be a center.
For the sake of concreteness in many of the examples in
the preceding discussion, we have relied on the situation
semantics of Barwise and Perry. The theory we are
developing does not depend on this particular semantical
treatment of definite noun phrases, but it does require
several of the distinctions that treatment provides. In
particular, our theory requires a semantical treatment
that accommodates the distinction between
interpretations of definite noun phrases that contribute
their content to the propositions expressed by sentences in
which they occur and interpretations that contribute only
their denotation—in other words, the distinction between
value-free and value-loaded interpretations. As noted, a
distinction of this sort can be effected within the
framework of &apos;possible-worlds&apos; approaches to the
semantics of natural language. In addition, we see the
need for interpretations of definite noun phrases to be
dependent on their discourse context. Once again, this is a
feature of interpretations that is accommodated in the
relational approach to semantics advocated by Barwise
and Perry, but it might be accommodated within other
approaches as wel1.8
Given that Cb(S), the center of sentence S in a
discourse, is the interpretation of a definite noun phrase,
how does it become related to S? In a typical example, S
will contain a full definite noun phrase or pronoun that
realizes the center. The realization relation is neither
semantic nor pragmatic. For example, N realizes c may
hold in cases where N is a definite description and e is its
denotation, its value-free interpretation, or an object
related to it by a &apos;speaker&apos;s reference.&apos; More
importantly, when N is a pronoun, the principles that
govern which c are such that N realizes c derive from
neither semantics nor pragmatics exclusively. They are
principles that must be elicited from the study of
discourse itself. A tentative formulation of some such
principles is given below.
Though it is typical that, when c is a center of S, S
contains an N such that N realizes c, it is by no means
necessary. In particular, for sentences containing noun
In 3 hiller treatment of our theory we will consider centers that
are realized by constituents in other syntactic categories.

properties of situation semantics with Montague semantics.
phrases that express functional relations (e.g., &apos;the door,&apos;
&apos;the owner&apos;) whose arguments are not exhibited
explicitly (e.g., a house is the current center, but so far
neither its door nor its owner has been mentioned),9 it is
sometimes the case that such an argument can be the
backward-looking center of the sentence. We are
currently studying such cases and expect to integrate that
study into our theory of discourse phenomena.
The basic rule that constrains the realization of the
backward-looking center of an utterance is a constraint on
the speaker, namely:
If the Cb of the current utterance is the same as the
Cb of the previous utterance, a pronoun should be used.
There are two things to note about this rule. First, it
does not preclude using pronouns for other entities as long
as one is used for the center. Second, it is not a hard
rule, but rather a principle, like a Gricean maxim, that
can be violated. However, such violations lead at best to
conditions in which the hearer is forced to draw
additional inferences.
As a simple example, consider the following sequence,
assuming at the outset that John is the center of the
discourse:
(8a) He called up Mike yesterday. (he=John)
(8b) He vas annoyed by John&apos;s call.
(8b) is unacceptable, unless it is possible to consider the
introduction of a second person named &apos;John.&apos; However,
intervening sentences that provide for a shift in center
from John to Mike (e.g., &apos;He was studying for his driver&apos;s
test&apos;) suffice to make (8b) completely acceptable.
Sidner&apos;s discourse focus corresponds roughly to Cb(S),
while her potential foci correspond approximately to
Cf(S). However, she also introduces an actor focus to
handle multiple pronouns in a single utterance. The basic
centering rule not only allows us to handle the same
examples more simply, but also appears to avoid one of
the complications in Sidner&apos;s account. Example D4 from
Sidner [1981) illustrates this problem:
(9-1)I haven&apos;t seen Jeff for several days.
(9-2)Carl thinks he&apos;s studying for his exams.
(9-3)But I think he went to the Cape with Linda.
On Sidner&apos;s account, Carl is the actor focus after (9-2)
and Jeff is the discourse focus (Cb(9-2)). Because the actor
focus is preferred as the referrent of pronominal
expressions, Carl is the leading candidate for the entity
referred to by he in (9-3). It is difficult to rule this case
out without invoking fairly special rules. On our account,
Jeff is Cb(9-2) and there is no problem. The addition of
actor focus was made to handle multiple pronouns--for
example, if (9-3) were replaced by

other than Cb(S) to be pronominalized as long as Cb(S)

Two aspects of centering affect the kinds of inferences a
hearer must draw in interpreting a definite description.
First, the shifting of center from one entity to another
requires recognition of this change. Most often such
changes are affected by the use of full definite noun
phrases, but in some instances a pronoun may be used.
For example, Grosz [19771 presents several examples of
pronouns being used to refer to objects mentioned many
utterances back. Second, the hearer must process
(interpret) the particular linguistic expression that realizes
the center.
Most previous attempts to account for the interaction of
different kinds of referring expressions with centering and
focusing (or &apos;topic&apos;) have conflated these two. For
example, Joshi and Weinstein [19811 present a preliminary
report on their research regarding the connection between
the computational complexity of the inferences required
to process a discourse and the coherence of that discourse
as assessed by measures that invoke the centering
phenomenon. However, several of the examples combine
changes of expression and shifts in centering.
Violations of the basic centering rule require the hearer
to draw two different kinds of inferences. The kind
required depends on whether a full definite noun phrase is
used to express the center or whether a pronoun is used
for a noncentered entity. We will consider each case
separately.
Several different functions may be served by the use of
a full definite noun phrase to realize the currently
centered entity. For instance, the full noun phrase may
include some new and unshared information about the
entity. In such cases, additional inferences arise from the
need to determine that the center has not shifted and that
the properties expressed hold for the centered entity. For
example, in the following sequences

<bodyText confidence="0.997590705882353">
the full definite noun phrases that are in boldface do
more than merely refer.
When the current center is not pronominalized (it may
not be present in the sentence), the use of a pronoun to
express an entity other than the current center, is
strongly constrained. The particular cases that have been
identified involve instances in which attention is being
shifted back to a previously centered entity (e.g., Grosz,
1977; Reichman, 1978) or to one element of a set that is
currently centered. In such cases, additional inferences

are required to determine that the pronoun does not refer
to the current center, as well as to identify the context
back to which attention is shifting. These shifts, though
indicated by linguistic expressions typically used for
centering (pronouns), correspond to a shift in global focus.

The main purpose of the paper was to sort out the
confusion about the roles of syntactic, semantic, and
pragmatic factors in the interpretation and generation of
definite noun phrases in discourse. Specific mechanisms
that account for the interactions among these factors were
presented. Discourses were shown to be coherent at two
different levels, i.e., with referring expressions used to
identify entities that are centered locally and those
focused upon more globally. The differences between
references at the global and local levels were discussed,
and the interaction of the syntactic role of a given noun
phrase and its semantic interpretation with centering was
described.

<abstract confidence="0.999707692307692">1. Overview theories typically various linguistic to one of the categories, semantic, if the phenomena in each category were relatively independent of those in the others. However, various phenomena in discourse do not seem to yield to any account that strictly a syntactic or semantic or pragmatic one. This paper focuses on particular phenomena of this sort—the use of various referring expressions such as definite noun phrases and pronouns—and examines their interaction with mechanisms used to maintain discourse coherence. Even a casual survey of the literature on definite descriptions and referring expressions reveals not only the individual provided by theorists (from several different disciplines), but also deep confusions about the roles that syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic factors play in accounting for these phenomena. The research we have undertaken is an to out some of these confusions and to create the basis for a theoretical framework that can account for variety of discourse phenomena which all three of language use interact. The major premise which our research depends is that the concepts necessary for an adequate understanding of the phenomena in question are not exclusively either syntactic or semantic or pragmatic. The next section of this paper defines two levels of coherence and describes roles in accounting use of singular definite noun phrases. To illustrate the integration of factors in explaining the uses of referring expressions, their use on one of these levels, i.e., the local one, is discussed in Sections 3 and 4. This account requires introducing the notion of the centers of a sentence in a discourse, a notion that cannot be defined in terms of factors that are exclusively syntactic or semantic or pragmatic. In Section 5, the interactions of the two levels with these factors and their effects on the uses of referring expressions in discourse are discussed.</abstract>

<abstract confidence="0.997433236607144">discourse utterances that combine into of the discourse, namely, units discourse that are typically larger than a single sentence, but smaller than the complete discourse. However, the constituent structure is not determined solely by the linear sequence of utterances. It is common for two contiguous utterances to be members of different subconstituents of the discourse (as with breaks between phrases in the syntactic analysis of a sentence); likewise, it is common for two utterances that are not contiguous to be members of the same subconstituent. An individual subconstituent of a discourse exhibits both internal coherence and coherence with the other subconstituents. That is, discourses have been shown to of coherence. coherence to the ways in which the larger segments of discourse relate to one another. It depends on such things as the function of a discourse, its subject matter, and rhetorical schema 1977, 1981; Reichman, 19811. coherence refers to the ways in which individual sentences bind together to form larger discourse segments. It depends on such things as the syntactic structure of an utterance, and the use of referring expressions 1Sidner, 19811. The two levels of discourse coherence correspond to two of focusing—global centering. Participants are said to be globally focused on a set of entities relevant to the overall discourse. These entities may either have been explicitly introduced into the discourse or be sufficiently closely related to such entities to be considered implicitly in focus [Grosz, 19811. In contrast. centering refers to a more local focusing process, one relates to identifying the single entity that an individual utterance most centrally concerns (Sidner, 1979; Joshi and Weinstein, 19811. 44 The two levels of focusing/coherence have different effects on the processing of pronominal and nonpronominal definite noun phrases. Global coherence and focusing are major factors in the generation and interpretation of nonpronominal definite referring expressions.- Local coherence and centering have greater effect on the processing of pronominal expressions. In Section 5 we shall describe the rules governing the use of these kinds of expressions and shall explain why additional processing by the hearer (needed for drawing additional inferences) is involved when pronominal expressions are used to refer to globally focused entities or nonpronominal expressions are used to refer to centered entities. Many approaches to language interpretation have ignored these differences, depending instead on powerful inference mechanisms to identify the referents of referring expressions. Although such approaches may suffice, especially for well-formed texts, they are insufficient in general. In particular, such approaches will not work for generation. Here the relationships among focusing, coherence, and referring expressions are essential and must be explicitly provided for. Theories—and systems based on them--will generate unacceptable uses of referring expressions if they do not take these into 3. Centering and Anaphora theory, the centers of a sentence in a discourse serve to integrate that sentence into the discourse. Each S, has a single center, a set of centers, Cb(S) serves to link S to the preceding discourse, while Cf(S) provides a set of entities to which the succeeding discourse may be linked. To avoid confusion, the phrase &apos;the center&apos; will he used to refer only to Cb(S). To clarify the notion of center, we will consider a number of discourses illustrating the various factors that combined in (abstractly) and in its identification in a discourse. In Section 5 we define center more precisely, show how it relates to Sidner&apos;s [19811 immediate focus and potential foci, and discuss how the linkages established by the centers of a sentence help to determine the degree of intelligibility of a discourse. We begin by showing that the center cannot be defined in syntactic terms alone. The interaction of semantics and centering is more complex and is discussed in Section 4. The following examples, drawn from Reinhart [19821, illustrate the point that the notion of center is not i.e., the syntax of a sentence S not determine which of its NPs (The differ in other respects also. Reichman [19811 and Grosz 110811 discuss some of these. attempts to incorporate focusing mechanisms in generation systems are described in [Appelt, 1981 and McKeown, 19821. can obviously affect the interpretation; for of this paper, it may be regarded as part of a for the use of this terminology discussed (la) Who did Max see yesterday? (lb) Max saw Rosa. (2a) Did anyone see Rosa yesterday? (2b) Max saw Rosa. (lb) and (2b) are identical, Cb(lb) Max and Cb(2b) is Rosa. This can be seen in part by noticing that saw Rosa&apos; seems more natural than (Ib) *Max saw her&apos; than (2b) (a fact consistent with the centering rule introduced in Section 5.) The subject NP is the center in one context, the object NP in the other. when the NP used to realize Cb(S) syntactically determined, the Cb(S) itself is not yet fully determined, for Cb(S) is typically not a linguistic entity (i.e., it is not a particular linguistic expression). Rosa, not &apos;Rosa&apos; is the Cb(2b). Consider. the discourse: (3a) How is Rosa? (3b) Did anyone see her yesterday? saw her. Here, Cb(3c) is Rosa, but clearly would not be in other contexts where the expression &apos;her&apos; still realized the backward-looking center of &apos;Max saw her.&apos; This is seen most simply by considering the discourse that would result if &amp;quot;How is Joan?&apos; replaced (3a). In the discourse that resulted, Joan, not Rosa, would be the center of (3c). 4. Centering and Realization The interactions of semantic and pragmatic factors with centering and their effects on referring expressions are more complex than the preceding discussion suggests. In the examples given above, the NPs that realize Cb(S) also denote it, but this is not always the case: we used the term &apos;realize&apos; in the above discussion advisedly. In this section, we consider two kinds of examples in which the center of a sentence is not simply the denotation of some noun phrase occurring in the sentence. First, we will examine several examples in which the choice of and interaction among different kinds of interpretations of definite noun phrases are affected by the local discourse context (i.e., centering). Second, the role of pragmatic factors in some problematic cases of referential uses of definite descriptions [Donnellan 19661 is discussed. 4.1. Realization and Value-Free and Value-Loaded Interpretations distinction between semantic denotation is necessary to treat the interaction between value-free and value-loaded interpretations [Barwise and Perry, 19821 of definite descriptions, as they occur in extended discourse. Consider, for example, the following sequence: (4a) The vice president of the United States is also president of the Senate. (4b) Historically, he is the president&apos;s key man in negotiations with Congress. to China, he handled tricky negotiations, so he prepared for this Cb(4b) and Cb(4b&apos;) are each realized by the anaphoric element &apos;he.&apos; But (4b) expresses the same thing as &apos;Historically, the vice president of the United States is the president&apos;s key man in negotiations with Congress&apos; (in which it is clear that no single individual vice president is being referred to) whereas (4b1 expresses the same thing as, &apos;As ambassador to China, the [person who is now] vice president of the United States handled many tricky negotiations,...&apos; This can be accounted for by observing that &apos;the vice president of the United States&apos; contributes both its value-free interpretation and its value-loading at the world type to Cf(4a). Cb(4b) is then the value-free interpretation and Cb(4b&apos;) is the valueloading, i.e., George Bush. In this example, both value-free and value-loaded interpretations are shown to stern from the same full definite noun phrase. It is also possible for the movement of the center from a value-free interpretation (for Cb(S)) to a value-loaded interpretation (for Cb of the next sentence)--or vice versa—to be accomplished solely with pronouns. That is, although (4b)-(4b1 is (at least for some readers) not a natural dialogue, similar sequences are possible. There appear to be strong constraints on the kinds of transitions that are allowed. In particular, if a given sentence forces either the value-free or value-loaded interpretation, then only that interpretation becomes possible in a subsequent sentence. However, if some sentence in a given context merely prefers one interpretation while allowing the other, then either one is possible in a subsequent sentence. For example, the sequence (6a) The vice president of the United States also president Senate. the president&apos;s key aan in negotiations vith Congress. in which &apos;he&apos; may be interpreted as either value-free or (VL), may be followed by either of following As to China, he zany tricky negotiations. is required to be at least old. However, if we change (5b) to force the value-loaded interpretation, as in (5b&amp;quot;), then only (5c) is possible. (Sb&apos;) Right now he is the president&apos;s key man in negotiations with Congress. Similarly, if (5b) is changed to force the value-free interpretation, as in (4b), then only (5c&apos;) is possible. If an intermediate sentence allows both interpretations but prefers one in a given context, then either is possible in the third sentence. A use with preference for a valueloaded interpretation followed by a use indicating the value-free interpretation is illustrated in the sequence: John thinks that the telephone is a toy. it every day. (11 preferred; ok) He doesn&apos;t realize that it is an invention changed the world. preference a value-free interpretation that is by value-loaded one is easiest to see in a dialogue situation; vice president of the United States is also president of the Senate. I he played some role in the House. (VF preferred; VL did, but that was before he was Realization and Use these examples, might appear that the concepts of value-free and value-loaded interpretation are identical to DonneIlan&apos;s 119661 attributive and referential uses of noun phrases. However, there is an important difference between these two distinctions. The importance to our theory is that the referential use of definite noun phrases introduces the need to take pragmatic factors (in particular speaker intention) into account, not just semantic factors. Donnellan [1966] describes the referential and uses of descriptions in the following way: &apos;A speaker who uses a definite description attributively in an assertion states something whoever or whatever is the so-and-so. speaker who uses a definite description referentially in an assertion, on the other hand, uses the description to enable his audience to pick out whom or what he is talking about and states something about that person or thing. In the first case the definite description might be said to occur essentially, for the speaker wishes to assert something about whatever or whoever fits that description; but in the referential use the definite description is merely one tool for doing a certain job--calling attention to a person or thing--and in general any other device for doing the same job, another description or a name, would do as well. In the attributive use, the attribute of being the so-and-so is all important, while it is not in the referential use.&apos; The distinction Donnellan suggests can be formulated in terms of the different propositions a sentence S containing a definite description D may be used to express on different occasions of use. When D is used referentially, it contributes its denotation to the proposition expressed by 46 S; when it is used attributively, it contributes to the proposition expressed by S a semantic interpretation related to the descriptive content of D. The identity of this semantic interpretation is not something about which Donnellan is explicit. Distinct formal treatments of the semantics of definite descriptions in natural language would construe the appropriate interpretation differently. In semantic treatments based on possible worlds, the appropriate interpretation would be a (partial) function from possible worlds to objects; in the situation semantics expounded by Barwise and Perry, the appropriate interpretation is a (partial) function from resource to objects. As just described, the referential-attributive distinction appears to be exactly the distinction that Barwise and Perry formulate in terms of the value-loaded and valuefree interpretations of definite noun phrases. But this gloss omits an essential aspect of the referentialattributive distinction as elaborated by Donnellan. In view, a speaker may use referentially to refer to an object distinct from the semantic denotation of the description, and, moreover, to refer to an object even when the description has no semantic denotation. In one sense, this phenomenon arises within the framework of Barwise and Perry&apos;s treatment of descriptions. If we understand the semantic denotation of a description to be the unique object that satisfies the content of the description, if there is one, then Barwise and Perry would allow that there are referential uses of a description D that contribute objects other than the semantic denotation of D to the propositions expressed by uses of sentences in which D occurs. But this is only because Barwise and Perry allow that a description may be evaluated at a resource situation other than the complete situation in order to arrive at its denotation on a given occasion of use. Still, the denotation of the description relative to a given resource situation is the unique object in the situation that satisfies the description relative to that situation. The referential uses of descriptions that Donnellan gives of do seem to arise by evaluation of descriptions at alternative resource situations, but rather through the *referential intentions&apos; of the speaker in his of the description. aspect of referential use is a rather a semantic phenomenon and is best analyzed in terms of the distinction between semantic reference and speaker&apos;s reference elaborated in Kripke [10771. the following discourses from Kripke [10771: &apos;any situation on which the speaker can focus attention is a potential candidate for a resource situation with to which the speaker may value load uses of descriptions. Such resource situations must contain a unique object satisfies description. husband is kind to her. NO. isn&apos;t. The can you&apos;re referring to isn&apos;t her husband. Her husband to He her isn&apos;t her husband. With (6a) and (7a), Kripke has in mind a case like the one discussed in Donnellan [19661, in which a speaker uses a description to refer to something other than the referent of that description, the unique thing that satisfies the description (if there is one). Kripke analyzes this case as an instance of the general phenomenon of a clash of intentions in language use. In the case at hand, the speaker has a general intention to use the description to refer to its semantic referent; his intention, distinct from general semantic intention, is to use it to refer to a particular individual. He incorrectly believes that these two intentions coincide this gives rise to a use of referring expression in which the speaker&apos;s reference reference are (The speaker&apos;s referent is presumably the woman&apos;s lover). From our point of view, the importance of the case resides in its showing that Cf(S) may include more than one entity, that is realized by a single NP in S. In this case, &apos;her husband&apos; contributes both the husband and the lover to Cf(6a) and Cf(7a). This can be seen by observing that both discourses seem equally appropriate and that the backward-looking centers of (6b) and (7b) are the husband and the lover, respectively, realized by their anaphoric elements. Hence, the forward-looking centers of a sentence may be related not semantically but to the that realize Hence, the importance of the referential/attributive distinction from our point of view is that it leads to cases in which the centers of a sentence may be pragmatically rather than semantically related to the noun phrases that realize them. 5. Center Movement and Center Realization-- Constraints En the foregoing sections we have discussed a number of examples to illustrate two essential points. First, the noun phrase that realizes the backward-looking center of an utterance in a discourse cannot be determined from the of the utterance alone. Second, the relation c noun phrases centers solely a semantic a pragmatic relation. This discussion has proceeded at a rather intuitive level, without explicit elaboration of the framework we regard as appropriate for dealing with centering and its role in explaining discourse phenomena. Before going on to describe constraints on the realization relation that are, of course, several alternative explanations; e.g., the may believe that the description is more likely than to be interpreted correctly by the hearer. Ferreting out the in a given situation requires of belief and the like. A discussion of issues is beyond the this paper. 67 explain certain phenomena in discourse, we should be somewhat more explicit about the notions of center and realization. We have said that each utterance S in a discourse has associated with it a backward-looking center, Cb(S), and a set of forward-looking centers, Cf(S). What manner of objects are these centers? They are the sort of objects that can serve as the semantic interpretations of singular That is, either they are objects in the world (e.g., planets, people, numbers) or they are functions from possible worlds (situations, etc.) to objects in the world that can be used to interpret definite descriptions. That is, whatever serves to interpret a definite noun phrase can be a center. For the sake of concreteness in many of the examples in the preceding discussion, we have relied on the situation semantics of Barwise and Perry. The theory we are developing does not depend on this particular semantical treatment of definite noun phrases, but it does require several of the distinctions that treatment provides. In particular, our theory requires a semantical treatment that accommodates the distinction between interpretations of definite noun phrases that contribute their content to the propositions expressed by sentences in which they occur and interpretations that contribute only their denotation—in other words, the distinction between value-free and value-loaded interpretations. As noted, a distinction of this sort can be effected within the framework of &apos;possible-worlds&apos; approaches to the semantics of natural language. In addition, we see the need for interpretations of definite noun phrases to be dependent on their discourse context. Once again, this is a feature of interpretations that is accommodated in the relational approach to semantics advocated by Barwise and Perry, but it might be accommodated within other as Given that Cb(S), the center of sentence S in a discourse, is the interpretation of a definite noun phrase, how does it become related to S? In a typical example, S will contain a full definite noun phrase or pronoun that realizes the center. The realization relation is neither nor pragmatic. For example, realizes c in cases where a definite description and is interpretation, or an object related to it by a &apos;speaker&apos;s reference.&apos; More when is pronoun, the principles that which c are such that realizes c from neither semantics nor pragmatics exclusively. They are principles that must be elicited from the study of itself. A tentative formulation of some principles is given below. it is typical that, when a center of S, S an that realizes c, is by no means necessary. In particular, for sentences containing noun treatment of our theory we will consider centers that are realized by constituents in other syntactic categories. 119831 discusses some of these issues and compares several of with Montague semantics. phrases that express functional relations (e.g., &apos;the door,&apos; &apos;the owner&apos;) whose arguments are not exhibited explicitly (e.g., a house is the current center, but so far its door nor its owner has been it is the case that such argument can be backward-looking center of the sentence. We are studying such and expect to integrate that into our theory of discourse The basic rule that constrains the realization of the backward-looking center of an utterance is a constraint on the speaker, namely: the Cb the current utterance is the same as the of the previous utterance, a pronoun should be are two things to about this rule. First, it not preclude using for other entities as long as one is used for the center. Second, it is not a hard but rather principle, like a Gricean maxim, that violated. However, such violations lead at best to in which the is forced to draw additional inferences. simple example, consider the following sequence, assuming at the outset that John is the center of the discourse: (8a) He called up Mike yesterday. (he=John) (8b) He vas annoyed by John&apos;s call.</abstract>

Realization and Value-Free and Value-Loaded Interpretations The distinction between realization and semantic denotation is necessary to treat the interaction between value-free and value-loaded interpretations [Barwise and Perry, 19821 of definite descriptions, as they occur in extended discourse. Consider, for example, the following sequence: 145 (4a) The vice president of the United States is also president of the Senate. (4b) Historically, he is the president&apos;s key man in negotiations with Congress. (4b&apos;) As Ambassador to China, he handled aany tricky negotiations, so h</context>

An individual subconstituent of a discourse exhibits both internal coherence and coherence with the other subconstituents. That is, discourses have been shown to have two levels of coherence. Global coherence refers to the ways in which the larger segments of discourse relate to one another. It depends on such things as the function of a discourse, its subject matter, and rhetorical schema (Grosz, 1977, 1981; Reichman, 19811. Local coherence refers to the ways in which individual sentences bind together to form larger discourse segments. It depends on such things as the syntactic structure of an utterance, ellipsis, and the use of pronominal referring expressions 1Sidner, 19811.

The interaction of semantics and centering is more complex and is discussed in Section 4. The following examples, drawn from Reinhart [19821, illustrate the point that the notion of center is not syntactically definable,4 i.e., the syntax of a sentence S does not determine which of its NPs realizes Cb(S). (The 2They differ in other respects also. Reichman [19811 and Grosz 110811 discuss some of these. 3Initial attempts to incorporate focusing mechanisms in generation systems are described in [Appelt, 1981 and McKeown, 19821. 4Intonation can obviously affect the interpretation; for the purposes of this paper, it may be regarded as part of a syntax. reasons for the use of this terminology are discussed in Section 4.) (la) Who did Max see yesterday? (lb) Max saw Rosa. (2a) Did anyone see Rosa yesterday? (2b) Max saw Rosa. Although (lb) and (2b) are identical, Cb(lb) is Max and Cb(2b) is Rosa. This can be seen in part by noticing that &apos;He saw Rosa&apos; seems more natural than (Ib) and *Max saw her&apos; than (2b) (a fact consistent with the centering rule introduced in Section 5.)
