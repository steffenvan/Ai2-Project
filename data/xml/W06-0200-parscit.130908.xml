<bodyText confidence="0.999816413793103">
Traditional approaches to the development and evaluation of Information Extraction (IE) systems have
relied on relatively small collections of up to a few hundred documents tagged with detailed semantic
annotations. While this paradigm has enabled rapid advances in IE technology, it remains constrained
by a dependence on annotated documents and does not make use of the information available in
large corpora. Alternative approaches, which make use of large text collections and inter-document
information, are now beginning to emerge – as evidenced by a parallel emergence of interest in learning
from unlabelled data in AI in general. For example, some systems learn extraction patterns by exploiting
information about their distribution across corpora; others exploit the redundancy of the Internet by
assuming that facts with multiple mentions are more reliable. These approaches require large amounts of
unannotated text, which is generally easy to obtain, and employ unsupervised or minimally supervised
learning algorithms, as well as related techniques such as co-training and active learning. These
alternative approaches are complementary to the established IE paradigm based on supervised training,
and are now forming a cohesive emergent trend in recent research. They constitute the focus of this
workshop.
There are several advantages to employing large text collections for IE. They provide enormous amounts
of training data, albeit mostly unannotated. Facts can be extracted from, or verified across, multiple
documents. Large text collections often contain vast amounts of redundancy in the form of multiple
references to or mentions of closely related facts. Redundancy can be exploited in the IE setting to
identify trends and patterns within the text, e.g., by means of Data Mining techniques.
For this workshop, we solicited papers presenting new, original work on learning extraction rules or
identifying facts across document boundaries while exploiting sizable amounts of unlabelled text in the
training stage, in the extraction stage, or both.
Eight papers were selected for inclusion in the workshop following a peer reviewing process. These
papers cover a wide range of topics in Information Extraction including traditional IE tasks such as
name tagging and relation extraction as well as other topics which are relevant to IE such as terminology
extraction, trend identification and lexical chains. The papers describe a number of techniques including
using the web as a data source and semi-supervised machine learning. We hope these will form the basis
of a productive workshop, and will stimulate further research into this area, which we believe is worth
pursuing.
