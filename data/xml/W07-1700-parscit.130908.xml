<bodyText confidence="0.987485344262296">
There are over 400 million speakers of Balto-Slavonic languages world-wide (synonymously used:
Balto-Slavic). As of 2007, almost a third of the 23 official European Union languages are Balto-Slavonic,
i.e. Bulgarian, Czech, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovak and Slovene. The two most recent rounds of the
EU Enlargement fundamentally raised the interest in these languages: translators and interpreters for new
language pairs need to be found, the interest in Machine (Aided) Translation systems has risen and tools
that help language specialists and information-seeking individuals are now highly sought after.
For some of the countries speaking Balto-Slavonic languages, there is a rich linguistic heritage, and
computational linguistics research and development is rather advanced. For others, however, there has
been little development. This is due to the often small number of speakers of that language (Latvian, for
instance, is spoken natively by around 1.5 Million people) combined with a lack of access to basic re-
sources needed for Natural Language Processing such as machine-readable corpora and dictionaries,
morphological analysers, part-of-speech taggers, parsers, etc. This leads to a linguistic brain drain as
some of the best computational linguistics students go abroad or – even when staying in their mother
country – work on developing new systems for English, French or German because resources for these
languages are readily available.
Even when linguistic resources and tools are available to the scientific community, methods that have
been successfully applied to Germanic and Romance languages cannot simply be ported to languages
from the Balto-Slavonic group. The most well-known linguistic phenomena making Balto-Slavonic text
analysis harder are the highly inflectional character and the related phenomenon of free word order in
these languages. The invited speaker at the workshop, Adam Przepiórkowski from the Polish Academy of
Sciences, explains these and a number of further specific linguistic phenomena typical for this language
group. Interestingly, he points out that the differences may not always make text analysis tasks harder, but
that they can also make some tasks easier.
When proposing this workshop to the Association for Computational Linguistics, we knew that Lan-
guage Technology for some of the languages is not very advanced and that, to date, not much work has
been carried out in the area of Information Extraction. The objective of this workshop was thus to pro-
mote the work on Balto-Slavonic languages by helping scientists to describe and share their resources and
to describe their efforts, hoping that the experiences of a few will be useful for many others. We did not
expect to receive papers presenting highly novel approaches to Information Extraction, but rather an ad-
aptation of known methods to new languages and solutions for specific challenges regarding the Balto-
Slavonic group. We found, however, that the current work on applying known approaches to a different
language type did produce some very interesting work.
Contents of these proceedings
We received in total 20 submissions, of which only eight were specifically about Information Extrac-
tion, i.e. named entity recognition or the extraction of definitions. One of these papers targeted a more
high-level Information Extraction task: an application combining more than one entity to fill a scenario
template. The other 12 papers fall under the category Enabling Technology, describing mostly morpho-
logical tools and resources, taggers, corpora, WordNet developments and topic segmentation of texts.
Each of the submissions was reviewed by at least three peers. Finally, we have accepted 9 papers for
oral presentations (acceptance rate of 45%) and selected a further three for poster presentations. We
want to use this opportunity to thank the Programme Committee for their thorough reviews and mostly
extensive and useful comments, as well as for keeping to the deadlines.
We do not want to claim that the proceedings of this workshop exhaustively reflect existing work on
Information Extraction for the targeted language group. The submissions we received nevertheless gave
us an overview of the current state-of-the-art for the various languages. Most of the submitted papers
covered work on the languages Polish, Czech and Bulgarian. Only individual papers concerned Lithua-
nian, Croatian, Serbian, Ukrainian and Russian. When selecting papers for acceptance, an important crite-
rion for us was to cover various languages.
The final workshop program includes 6 papers specifically addressing Information Extraction while
the other six discuss Enabling Technologies. All of the papers clearly show how Natural Language Proc-
essing differs for Balto-Slavonic languages, compared to Germanic, Romance or other languages.
Our appeal
During the organisation of this workshop, we saw that some very good text analysis work has been car-
ried out for some of the Balto-Slavonic languages. However, we were also reminded that many good sci-
entists cannot work on interesting and promising research subjects and high-level applications because
they first need to create the necessary linguistic resources. We therefore want to appeal to all researchers
in the community to make as many resources and tools available to their peers as they can. This will in
the end benefit all the scientists and – in the long run – the country as a whole. In this spirit, the Joint Re-
search Centre has compiled – and distributes for free – a paragraph-aligned and subject domain-classified
parallel corpus in 22 languages (the JRC-Acquis). May this resource be useful for the communities work-
ing on less-widely spoken languages.
