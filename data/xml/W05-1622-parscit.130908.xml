This paper describes ongoing work on the choice
of modal expressions in the generation of recom-
mendations about courses of study within the B.A.-
program of the Ruhr-Universität Bochum. We fo-
cus our work on the German modal verbs müssen
(must), können (can), the subjunctive form sollte
(should), and dürfen (may). The idea is to combine
insights from formal semantics into the meaning of
modal verbs with requirements for their choice in
NLG-systems in order to achieve a linguistically
satisfying model of their choice. The overall model
is implemented in the CAN-system that plans
courses of study and generates recommendations

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980666666667">
From a typological perspective, modality concerns the
speaker’s estimation of the possible and necessary occur-
rence, respectively, of some state of affairs [van der Auwera
and Plungian, 1998]. In many languages, modality is lin-
guistically realized by a whole bundle of different means,
with modal verbs being the most prominent ones.
In this paper, we will describe the realization of uses of the
four German modal verbs müssen (must, have to, need to),
können (can, to be able to), dürfen (may, could, to be al-
lowed to do) and the subjunctive form of sollen, i.e. sollte
(should). As the English translations indicate, there is no
simple correspondence between the meaning of these Ger-
man modal verbs and their counterparts in other languages.
In particular, the pragmatic conditions for their use differ
widely so that a straightforward adoption of the conditions
we are giving in this paper to other languages will probably
not be possible.
In general, the problem of the choice of modal verbs is the
fact that the use of modals is, among other things, deter-
mined by information that is usually only implicitly given in
a discourse. This information must be made available during
macroplanning for the entire text in a way that enables the
choice of the contextually appropriate modal verbs.
In what follows, we will first outline the semantics and
pragmatics of modal verbs in general, and the four German
modals plus sollen in particular. Based on this, we will de-
lineate our choice model for modals and its application to
the aforementioned four modal verbs. Finally, we will show
how this model is integrated into the CAN-System that we
are currently developing.

2 The meanings of modal verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934357142857">
The meaning of modals is deeply rooted in information that
is only implicitly given in a discourse, but plays a crucial
role in the full understanding of the underlying speaker’s
intention. This context-dependence results in different read-
ings. A sentence like Peter must attend the lecture on se-
mantics can be interpreted in numerous ways: It could ex-
press that according to the knowledge of the speaker it is
necessary that Peter attends this lecture, or that Peter´s
course of study requires his attendance in the lecture on se-
mantics.
Since Kratzer´s (1977) seminal work on a uniform and for-
mal treatment of the semantics of modal verbs, the context-
dependence of the meaning of modals is traced back to so-
called conversational backgrounds (also called modal do-
mains or modal bases) that provide that information against
which the modalized sentence has to be interpreted. Accord-
ing to her widely accepted analysis in formal semantics, the
meaning of modal verbs depends on the class of permitted
conversational backgrounds and the so-called modal force,
i.e. whether the modal verbs express possibility or necessity.
Possibility and necessity are defined as consistency and en-
tailment with respect to the respective conversational back-
ground: a proposition is possible if it is consistent with the
relevant background, and it is necessary if it is entailed by
the conversational background.
Accordingly, modal verbs differ in their semantics with re-
spect to these two parameters: their inherent modal force,
and the classes of modal domains associated with them.1
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.581533571428571">
1 In more recent works, Kratzer`s (1977) original work has
been extended to a doubly relative analysis of modal verbs: Their
meaning does not only depend on one modal domain, but addition-
ally on a second one, the “ordering source”. An ordering source is
a set of propositions that describes the plausibility of the states
given in the primary modal domain. Since this refinement of
Kratzer’s work does not concern our treatment of the choice of

<bodyText confidence="0.99988085">
The classifications of relevant conversational backgrounds
that have been postulated for an adequate analysis of the
meaning of modal expressions differ widely in the literature.
They range from two types – a basic distinction between
epistemic and “root” modals - to more than twenty in von
Stechow’s (2004) classification.
Kratzer uses a modal logic to describe the meaning of modal
verbs. However, she leaves open what conversational back-
grounds really are (besides their characterization as sets of
propositions), although this concept is the linchpin of a sat-
isfying analysis of the meaning of modals.
Also discourse-oriented approaches to the meaning of mo-
dals as, e.g., Roberts (1989), Frank (1996), or Stone (1999)
do not say much about the structure and content of conver-
sational backgrounds. These approaches analyze specific
uses of modals as anaphoric expressions: in some discourse
segments, modals pick up modal domains introduced by
previous modal expressions, and must be interpreted against
this already introduced hypothetical scenario. Stone (1999),
for example, gives the following sentence pair:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.827252">
(1) A wolf might walk into the house. It would eat you.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99500175">
In order to interpret the second modalized sentence cor-
rectly, the anaphoric connection between the content of that
sentence and the possible scenario of the first one must be
made explicit.

2.1 The meaning of müssen, dürfen, sollen, sollte,
and können
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917909090909">
We will outline what semanticians have to say about the
meaning of these modal verbs, and characterize those prag-
matic conditions for their use that are of importance for this
paper.
Müssen and sollen both express necessity as modal force.
The semantic difference between these two verbs concerns
the admissible conversational backgrounds: While müssen
can be used with any conversational background, the use of
sollen is restricted to specific ones, viz. those that express a
specified ideal like laws or social norms. For example, while
the sentence
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9690635">
(2) Peter muss den Kurs besuchen
(Peter must attend the lecture)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7324411">
can, in principle, be interpreted with respect to any kind of
conversational background, some of these backgrounds are
not possible for the sentence Peter soll den Kurs besuchen
(Peter shall attend the lecture). The former sentence can be
interpreted as:
1. In view of what is known by the speaker/the lis-
tener/..., it is necessary that Peter attends the lec-
ture (epistemic interpretation)
modals in this paper, we will not go into the details. However, we
will pick up that point in the depiction of our future work.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998532875">
2. In view of what the conditions of study determines,
it is necessary that Peter attends the lecture (deon-
tic interpretation)
3. in view of someone´s will, it is necessary that Peter
attends the lecture (volitional interpretation)
4. in view of achieving certain goals in is necessary
that Peter attends the lecture (teleological interpre-
tation)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.972511222222222">
and so on.
Sollen, however, cannot presuppose conversational back-
grounds that are evoked by the subject (cf, von Stechow,
2004; Zifonun et al., 1997). For example, a deontic interpre-
tation of Peter soll den Kurs besuchen is not possible with
the respective obligations as conversational backgrounds
determined by Peter himself.
In addition to the modal verbs, mood is also a linguistic
means to express modality. Often, mood weakens the modal
force so that sollte does not express the necessity of the em-
bedded proposition anymore, but a weaker modal force that
comes close to possibility.
Können and dürfen seem to be the counterparts of müssen
and sollen. They express possibility as modal force. Können
is not confined to specific conversational backgrounds,
while dürfen can – similar to sollen - only be used with ex-
tra-subjective ideal backgrounds, preferably deontic ones.
The sentence
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.970993">
(3) Peter darf den Kurs besuchen
(Peter may attend the lecture)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999145411764706">
means: his attendance of the lecture is compatible with his
duties (imposed by someone else), the conditions of study,
the will of a third person, some relevant facts, and so on.
Although this semantic analysis shows convincingly the
relevance of the modal force and the conversational back-
grounds for a systematic treatment of the meaning of mo-
dals, it cannot be the whole story of the meaning of modals.
If conversational backgrounds and modal forces would suf-
ficiently explain the meaning of modals, every modal verb
with a restricted set of admissible conversational back-
grounds could be replaced by the modals können and
müssen, respectively, without changing the meaning of the
respective sentence. Although this might be true with re-
spect to the truth conditions of the single sentences, replac-
ing the specific modals by more general ones nevertheless
results in sentences with different readings. For example,
replacing the sentence
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.928431714285714">
(4) Du darfst den Semantik-Kurs besuchen und du solltest
den Syntax-Kurs besuchen (You may attend the
semantics lecture and you should visit the lecture on
syntax)
by the sentence
(4´) Du kannst den Semantik-Kurs besuchen und du
müsstest den Syntax-Kurs besuchen (You can attend
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999269388888889">
the semantics lecture and you ought to attend the
lecture on syntax)
leads to different prominent meanings: while the first sen-
tence clearly expresses a permission and a recommendation,
the second one is more neutral with respect to the relevant
pragmatic meaning. Additionally, the second clause ex-
presses a weak deontically motivated entailment.
Hence, the modal verbs are associated with specific prag-
matic conditions for their use. We will refer to those prag-
matics aspects only that are crucial for our treatment of the
modals. We start from the assumption that the uses of
müssen and können do not require specific pragmatic con-
straints. Sollte does not express necessity (as the indicative
sollen does) but possibility, and shall be used if the goal of
the system is to express the proposition as a strong advice.
Dürfen shall be used if the system expresses a permission
that is based on the courses the user has completed success-
fully so far, or if the user has the permission to study at all.

2 Modality in natural language generation
systems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964827586207">
In general, there is not much work on the computational
treatment of modals, be it in NL Understanding or NL Gen-
eration.
There seems to be a clear gap between the relevance of mo-
dality in texts and dialogues produced by human speakers
and its consideration in NLG-systems. While modal expres-
sions appear in all kinds of text genres produced by humans,
be it newspaper articles or dialogue contributions, their re-
alization in NLG-systems did not receive much attention so
far.2 This disregarding of modality might be due to the na-
ture of the text types that typically describe entities as, e.g.,
animals (Peba-II; Milosavljevic 1997) or air–qualities
(TEMSIS, Busemann and Horacek 1997). All of these gen-
eration systems present data or knowledge units that are
“true” in a certain sense. None of these systems have to
cope with an estimation whether some events will happen
with a specific probability, given the information state of the
system and the user. However, estimations of such a kind
are the basis for the use of modals.
Our work is loosely inspired by the treatment of modals in
Crouch and Pulman (1993), but differs from their work in
several crucial respects. Crouch and Pulman investigate the
use of temporal and modal expressions in an NL-interface to
a planner that produces partial plans in an engineering do-
main. Instead of using a modal logic with its underlying
possible world semantics, the authors determine possible
and necessary propositions against the range of plans avail-
able to solve a task. The necessity relation holds if the
proposition (more specifically, the temporal orders and rela-

2 This statement might be too strong in case of the use of sys-
temic grammars. Systemic grammars are able to convert complex
modality-related speech-functions into corresponding modal ex-
pressions. However, systemic grammars do not consider content
planning tasks that we are describing in this paper.

tions in the corresponding formula) can be inferred from the
plan description. In contrast to this, a formula is possible if
its negation can be inferred from the plan description.

3 The choice of modal verbs in CAN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975234042553">
We are currently developing the CAN-system (Conceptuali-
zation for Modal Expressions) that generates recommenda-
tions about courses of study within the B.A. program of the
Ruhr-Universität Bochum. A user provides the system with
his/her current term number and the lectures he/she has fin-
ished so far, and the system generates a recommendation
which lectures he should/must/shall/may/can take.
A planner provides the partially ordered plan which de-
scribes the progression of the overall study from the current
semester to the final degree. The propositions are checked in
a piecemeal fashion in order to determine whether they nec-
essarily or possibly hold with respect to the conversational
background. This procedure determines the modal force,
and a subclass of the relevant modal verbs with it. After-
wards the pragmatic conditions will be checked to select the
appropriate modal verb, and that verb is inserted into a syn-
tactic template for the corresponding sentence.
We confine our analysis to epistemic and deontic meanings
of the aforementioned modal verbs, because these readings
are the most prominent ones in our domain. Deontic mean-
ings are determined by the structure and content of the plan
to be verbalized. Epistemic meanings are determined by the
discourse state. Both knowledge sources will be handled by
the same procedure which makes an extension to other types
of modal meanings manageable. In other words, we adopt
the bipartite distinction between necessary and possible
formulae, although this might not completely correspond to
the fine-grained modal forces expressed in natural lan-
guages. Furthermore, we adopt the modeling of possibility
as consistency with the conversational background, and ne-
cessity as entailment from that background.
If one of the modal relations is true, we know what the mo-
dal force is, and are able to determine that subclass of modal
verbs that expresses the proven modal force. Otherwise the
underlying proposition will linguistically not be modalized.
The deontic background is determined by the plan. Accord-
ing to the partially ordered plan, some lectures can only be
attended if other lectures had already been completed suc-
cessfully, but this order does not hold between all lectures.
The obligation to attend certain lectures during some semes-
ter can directly be read from the plan. The modal force will
be derived from the plans.
An epistemic background is given by what the system
knows of the user´s current course of his study and the in-
formation provided by the system so far. For this, we use a
discourse record that keeps track of the user´s input and
what he has been told.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.980733">
3.1 Planning for the choice of modals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995511046875">
The task of the planner is to place the obligatory lectures at
the right nodes in the plan, and to determine possible nodes
of the optional lectures. For example, while all students of
Linguistics have to attend a lecture on pragmatics in the
third semester, they can attend an additional lecture with a
topic of their own choice, but the student must have satisfied
its prerequisites already.
An “action” of the plan is realized as a pair that represents
the status of the lecture with respect to the semester (obliga-
tory, optional), and the title of the lecture.
Suppose a fully specified plan contains the following order
of single lectures, starting with the second semester:
2nd semester 3rd semester 4th semester
If each “action” of this part of the plan shall linguistically be
realized, only some of the four modal verbs are applicable.
The use of the modals depends on the status of the lectures
as being obligatory or optional in a certain semester, and the
existence of certain preconditions of the planning operators.
The distinguishing feature of obligatory lectures is that there
are no alternatives for them; they are necessary courses in a
certain semester. Hence, the lectures on semantics and prag-
matics will be mentioned in sentences with müssen as modal
verb. Optional lectures appear to be more interesting be-
cause in principle they can be attended in any semester, as
long as the prerequisites for their attendance have been
achieved by the student. The prerequisites are modelled as
preconditions of corresponding planning operators. Linguis-
tically, optionality is expressed by modals which express
possibility as modal force, and the use of these modals is
constrained by additional pragmatic conditions for their use.
Whether the optional lectures on HSPG and parsing, respec-
tively, will be mentioned in sentences with können, dürfen,
or sollte depends on the decision to recommend or permit
these lectures, which will be derived from conditions we
will mention in the following section.
To sum up, the choice of the appropriate modal verbs de-
pends on:
- the status of the lecture, whether it is optional or
obligatory in one semester,
- the user´s possible achievement of prerequisites of
optional lectures,
- the placement of optional lectures in the overall
plan,
- pragmatic functions like expressing a permission or
a recommendation.
The first three factors belong to the conversational back-
ground, while the last one seems to be an additional con-
straint for the use of some of the modal verbs. Dealing with
these aspects of the conversational background can be char-
acterized in the following way:
Let P be the plan with the obligatory lectures placed in the
right positions, and T(P) the set of all totally specified plans
based on P that include possible placements of the optional
lectures.
Every lecture in P marked as obligatory is necessary with
respect to the study process.
Additionally, for every proposition p we check whether T(P)
→ p holds or T(P) ∪ {p} is true. If the former formula is
true, the modal verb müssen can be realized. If the latter
formula is true, we have to check whether the pragmatic
conditions for the use of one of the modals verbs that ex-
press possibility are given in the discourse record. The cor-
responding decision results in the choice of the verb dürfen,
können, and sollte, respectively.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999618">
3.1 An example: the choice of dürfen and sollte
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989222944444444">
The choice of dürfen and sollte may illustrate the choice
mechanism that takes into account the plan structure and the
discourse state, respectively.
Both dürfen and sollte express possibility as modal force so
that they compete with können as the unmarked modal verb
for expressing possibility. Since dürfen and sollte can only
be used if specific pragmatic conditions are satisfied (and
with restricted sets of conversational backgrounds), können
will always be chosen if the modal force is possibility and
the other two modals cannot be used.
Expressing a permission by using dürfen is based on the
following conditions:
(a) if the user is willing to begin his studies and CAN
does not know whether he is registered at the uni-
versity at all, CAN asks for a corresponding con-
firmation. In case of a positive response the per-
mission to study the courses of the first semester
can be given, and dürfen will be used.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.793554">
(b) If CAN does not know whether some courses as
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953740740741">
preconditions of a course are satisfied it asks the
user whether he attended these required courses.
The user has to give this information, and the sys-
tem integrates the courses into the plan. Since the
preconditions for the respective course are now sat-
isfied, the permission to attend this course will be
signalled by the use of dürfen.
In general, our impression is that permissions – the prag-
matic function of dürfen when a deontic conversational
background becomes relevant – can best be derived in dia-
logue situations. An NLG-system that permits to attend a
certain course must be set into the position to express the
permission at all. In our scenario, this is the cased if CAN
requires additional information and asks for it. In this re-
spect permissions are different from recommendations ex-
pressed by sollte, which can be determined without refer-
ence to a dialogue situation.
Recommendations declare a certain state of affairs as advan-
tageous with respect to some goal. In our scenario, attending
a course in a specific semester is advantageous for the com-
pletion of the course of study, if its attendance optimizes the
number of semesters that are necessary for that completion.
The system checks whether the course can successfully be
integrated into the overall plan and computes the corre-
sponding consequences: If attending this course during the
current semester does not increase the number of semesters
required to achieve the completion within the normal dura-

tion of study, but a different course does, that is also offered
for the current semester, then it is advantageous to attend
this course, and the modal sollte is chosen. In other words,
the system compares the consequences of attending courses
with respect to the length of study.

4 Future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9937123125">
The work reported in this paper describes the current state
of the CAN-system. Our long-term goal is a wide coverage
of modal expressions including all German modal verbs as
well as other modals as, e.g., modal nouns, adverbs, and
particles. The evaluation of the generated modal expressions
is an additional research topic, as well as the interplay of
modality with mood and temporality.
Currently, our discourse record is a simplifying collection of
propositions, but we will need a more sophisticated version
of this knowledge store if modal subordination [Roberts,
1989; Stone, 1999] becomes a topic of our research. Modal
subordination becomes relevant in sentence pairs of the fol-
lowing kind:
(5) Du könntest den Semantik-Kurs besuchen. Dann musst
du im folgenden Semester den Pragmatik-Kurs besu-
chen. (You could attend the semantics lecture. In this
case you must attend the lecture on pragmatics in the
next semester.)
In order to choose müssen for the second sentence, the hy-
pothetical event introduced by the first sentence must be
considered as background so that ordering sources will be-
come an additional factor for a discourse-sensitive choice of
modals.
Finally, the decision to modalize a proposition is often
grounded in specific dialogue settings like the existence of
social power relations between the participants, or their re-
spective beliefs of the beliefs states of the addressees. We
assume that a dialogue situation explains the use of modals
in a more natural way than the current model, as our current
treatment of permissions already indicates. Therefore, in the
long run CAN shall be able to react dynamically to user re-
quests.
