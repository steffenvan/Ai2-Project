In the course of developing natural language inter-
faces, computational linguists are often in the posi-
tion of evaluating different theoretical approaches to
the analysis of natural language (NL). They might
want to (a) evaluate and improve on a current sys-
tem, (b) add a capability to a system that it didn&apos;t
previously have, (c) combine modules from different
systems.
Consider the goal of adding a discourse compo-
nent to a system, or evaluating and improving one
that is already in place. A discourse module might
combine theories on, e.g., centering or local focus-
ing [GJW83, Sid79], global focus [Gro77], coher-
ence relations[Hob85], event&apos; reference [Web86], in-
tonational structure [PH87], system vs. user be-
liefs [Po186], plan or intent recognition or production
[Coh78, AP86, SI81], control[WS88], or complex syn-
tactic structures [Pri85]. How might one evaluate the
relative contributions of each of these factors or com-
pare two approaches to the same problem?
In order to take steps towards establishing a
methodology for doing this type of comparison, we
conducted a case study. We attempt to evalu-
ate two different approaches to anaphoric processing
in discourse by comparing the accuracy and cover-
age of two published algorithms for finding the co-
specifiers of pronouns in naturally occurring texts and
dialogues[Hob76b, BFP87]. Thus there are two parts
to this paper: we present the quantitative results of
hand-simulating these algorithms (henceforth Hobbs
algorithm and BFP algorithm), but this analysis nat-
urally gives rise to both a qualitative evaluation and
recommendations for performing such evaluations in
general. We illustrate the general difficulties encoun-
tered with quantitative evaluation. These are prob-
lems with: (a) allowing for underlying assumptions,
(b) determining how to handle underspecifications,
and (c) evaluating the contribution of false positives
and error chaining. -
Although both algorithms are part of theories of
discourse that posit the interaction of the algorithm
with an inference or intentional component, we will
not use reasoning in tandem with the algorithm&apos;s op-
eration. We have made this choice because we want
to be able to analyse the performance of the algo-
rithms across different domains. We focus on the
linguistic basis of these approaches, using only selec-
tional restrictions, so that our analysis is independent
of the vagaries of a particular knowledge representa-
tion. Thus what we are evaluating is the extent to
which these algorithms suffice to narrow the search
of an inference component&apos;. This analysis gives us
&apos;But note the definition of success in section 2.1.
some indication of the contribution of syntactic con-
straints, task structure and global focus to anaphoric
processing.
The data on which we compare the algorithms are
important if we are to evaluate claims of general-
ity. If we look at types of NL input, one clear di-
vision is between textual and interactive input. A
related, though not identical factor is whether the
language being analysed is produced by more than
one person, although this distinction may be con-
flated in textual material such as novels that contain
reported conversations. Within two-person interac-
tive dialogues, there are the task-oriented master-
slave type, where all the expertise and hence much
of the initiative, rests with one person. In other two-
person dialogues, both parties may contribute dis-
course entities to the conversation on a more equal
basis. Other factors of interest are whether the di-
alogues are human-to-human or human-to-computer,
as well as the modality of communication, e.g. spoken
or typed, since some researchers have indicated that
dialogues, and particularly uses of reference within
them, vary along these dimensions [Coh84, Tho80,
GSBC86, D389, WS89].
We analyse the performance of the algorithms on
three types of data. Two of the samples are those that
Hobbs used when developing his algorithm. One is an
excerpt from a novel and the other a sample of jour-
nalistic writing. The remaining sample is a set of 5
human-human, keyboard-mediated, task-oriented di-
alogues about the assembly of a plastic water pump
[Coh84]. This covers only a subset of the above types.
Obviously it would be instructive to conduct a similar
analysis on other textual types.

<bodyText confidence="0.999902285714286">
When embarking on such a comparison, it would be
convenient to assume that the inputs to the algo-
rithms are identical and compare their outputs. Un-
fortunately since researchers do not even agree on
which phenomena can be explained syntactically and
which semantically, the boundaries between two mod-
ules are rarely the same in NL systems. In this case
the BFP centering algorithm and Hobbs algorithm
both make ASSUMPTIONS about other system com-
ponents. These are, in some sense, a further specifi-
cation of the operation of the algorithms that must
be made in order to hand-simulate the algorithms.
There are two major sets of assumptions, based on
discourse segmentation and syntactic representation.
We attempt to make these explicit for each algorithm
and pinpoint where the algorithms might behave dif-
ferently were these assumptions not well-founded.
In addition, there may be a number of UNDER-
SPECIFICATIONS in the descriptions of the algorithms.
These often arise because theories that attempt to
categorize naturally occurring data and algorithms
based on them will always be prey to previously un-
encountered examples. For example, since the BFP
salience hierarchy for discourse entities is based on
grammatical relation, an implicit assumption is that
an utterance only has one subject. However the novel
Wheels has many examples of reported dialogue such
as She continued, unperturbed, &amp;quot;Mr. Vale quotes
the Bible about air pollution.&amp;quot; One might wonder
whether the subject is She or Mr. Vale. In some
cases, the algorithm might need to be further speci-
ficied in order to be able to process any of the data,
whereas in others they may just highlight where the
algorithm needs to be modified (see section 3.2). In
general we count underspecifications as failures.
Finally, it may not be clear what the DEFINITION
OF SUCCESS is. In particular it is not clear what to
do in those cases where an algorithm produces multi-
ple or partial interpretations. In this situation a sys-
tem might flag the utterance as ambiguous and draw
in support from other discourse components. This
arises in the present analysis for two reasons: (1) the
constraints given by [GJW86] do not always allow
one to choose a preferred interpretation, (2) the BFP
algorithm proposes equally ranked interpretations in
parallel. This doesn&apos;t happen with the Hobbs algo-
rithm because it proposes interpretations in a sequen-
tial manner, one at a time. We chose to count as a
failure those situations in which the BFP algorithm
only reduces the number of possible interpretations,
but Hobbs algorithm stops with a correct interpre-
tation. This ignores the fact that Hobbs may have
rejected a number of interpretations before stopping.
We also have not needed to make a decision on how to
score an algorithm that only finds one interpretation
for an utterance that humans find ambiguous.

2.1.1 Centering algorithm

<bodyText confidence="0.999382">
The centering algorithm as defined by Brennan,
Friedman and Pollard, (BFP algorithm), is derived
from a set of rules and constraints put forth by Grosz,

<bodyText confidence="0.999419736842105">
Josh i and Weinstein [GJW83, 0JW86]. We shall not
reproduce this algorithm here (See [BFP87]). There
are two main structures in the centering algorithm,
the CB, the BACKWARD LOOKING CENTER, which is
what the discourse is &apos;about&apos;, and an ordered list,
CF, of FORWARD LOOKING CENTERS, which are the
discourse entities available to the next utterance for
pronominalization. The centering framework predicts
that in a local coherent stretch of dialogue, speakers
will prefer to CONTINUE talking about the same dis-
course entity, that the CB will be the highest ranked
entity of the previous utterance&apos;s forward centers that
is realized in the current utterance, and that if any-
thing is pronominalized the CB must be.
In the centering framework, the order of the
forward-centers list is intended to reflect the salience
of discourse entities. The BFP algorithm orders this
list by grammatical relation of the complements of
the main verb, i.e. first the subject, then object,
then indirect object, then other subcategorized-for
complements, then noun phrases found in adjunct
clauses. This captures the intuition that subjects are
more salient than other discourse entities.
The BFP algorithm added linguistic constraints
on CONTRA-INDEXING to the centering framework.
These constraints are exemplified by the fact that,
in the sentence he likes him, the entity cospecified by
he cannot be the same as that cospecified by him. We
say that he and him are CONTRA-INDEXED. The BFP
algorithm depends on semantic processing to precom-
pute these constraints, since they are derived from
the syntactic structure, and depend on some notion
of c-command[Rei76]. The other assumption that is
dependent on syntax is that the the representations
of discourse entities can be marked with the gram-
matical function through which they were realized,
e.g. subject.
The BFP algorithm assumes that some other mech-
anism can structure both written texts and task-
oriented dialogues into hierarchical segments. The
present concern is not with whether there might be
a grammar of discourse that determines this struc-
ture, or whether it is derived from the cues that
cooperative speakers give hearers to aid in process-
ing. Since centering is a local phenomenon and is
intended to operate within a segment, we needed to
deduce a segmental structure in order to analyse the
data. Speaker&apos;s intentions, task structure, cue words
like O.K. now.., intonational properties of utterances,
coherence relations, the scoping of modal operators,
and mechanisms for shifting control between dis-
course participants have all been proposed as ways
of determining discourse segmentation [Gro77, GSSG,
Rei85, PH87, HL87, Hob78, Hob85, Rob88, WS88].
Here, we use a combination of orthography, anaphora
distribution, cue words and task structure. The rules
are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998640727272727">
• In published texts, a paragraph is a new seg-
ment unless the first sentence has a pronoun in
subject position or a pronoun where none of the
preceding sentence-internal noun phrases match
its syntactic features.
• In the task-oriented dialogues, the action PICK-
UP marks task boundaries hence segment bound-
aries. Cue words like next, then, and now also
mark segment boundaries. These will usually co-
occur but either one is sufficient for marking a
segment boundary.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.94137975">
BFP never state that cospecifiers for pronouns
within the same segment are preferred over those in
previous segments, but this is an implicit assump-
tion, since this line of research is derived from Sid-
ner&apos;s work on local focusing. Segment initial utter-
ances therefore are the only situation where the BFP
algorithm will prefer a within-sentence noun phrase
as the cospecifier of a pronoun.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.459099">
2.1.2 Hobbs&apos; algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989608695652">
The Hobbs algorithm is based on searching for a
pronoun&apos;s co-specifier in the syntactic parse tree of
input sentences [Hob76b]. We reproduce this algo-
rithm in full in the appendix along with an example.
Hobbs algorithm operates on one sentence at a time,
but the structure of previous sentences in the dis-
course is available. It is stated in terms of searches
on parse trees. When looking for an intrasentential
antecedent, these searches are conducted in a left-to-
right, breadth-first manner. However, when looking
for a pronoun&apos;s antecedent within a sentence, it will
go sequentially further and further up the tree to the
left of the pronoun, and that failing will look in the
previous sentence. Hobbs does not assume a segmen-
tation of discourse structure in this algorithm; the
algorithm will go back arbitrarily far in the text to
find an antecedent. In more recent work, Hobbs uses
the notion of COHERENCE RELATIONS to structure the
discourse [HM87].
The order by which Hobbs&apos; algorithm traverses the
parse tree is the closest thing in his framework to pre-
dictions about which discourse entities are salient. In
the main it prefers co-specifiers for pronouns that
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99002">
253
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998915">
are within the same sentence, and also ones that
are closer to the pronoun in the sentence. This
amounts to a claim that different discourse entities
are salient, depending on the position of a pronoun
in a sentence. When seeking an intersentential co-
specification, Hobbs algorithm searches the parse tree
of the previous utterance breadth-first, from left to
right. This predicts that entities realized in subject
position are more salient, since even if an adjunct
clause linearly precedes the main subject, any noun
phrases within it will be deeper in the parse tree. This
also means that objects and indirect objects will be
among the first possible antecedents found, and in
general that the depth of syntactic embedding is an
important determiner of discourse prominence.
Miming to the assumptions about syntax, we note
that Hobbs assumes that one can produce the cor-
rect syntactic structure for an utterance, with all ad-
junct phrases attached at the proper point of the
parse tree. In addition, in order to obey linguistic
constraints on coreference, the algorithm depends on
the existence of a N parse tree node, which denotes
a noun phrase without its determiner (See the ex-
ample in the Appendix). Hobbs algorithm procedu-
rally encodes contra-indexing constraints by skipping
over NP nodes whose N node dominates the part of
the parse tree in which the pronoun is found, which
means that he cannot guarantee that two contra-
indexed pronouns will not choose the same NP as
a co-specifier.
Hobbs also assumes that his algorithm can some-
how collect discourse entities mentioned alone into
sets as co-specifiers of plural anaphors. Hobbs dis-
cusses at length other assumptions that he makes
about the capabilities of an interpretive process that
operates before the algorithm [Hob761)]. This in-
cludes such things as being able to recover syntac-
tically recoverable omitted text, such as elided verb
phrases, and the identities of the speakers and hearers
in a dialogue.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.480199">
2.1.3 Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985">
A major component of any discourse algorithm is the
prediction of which entities are salient, even though
all the factors that contribute to the salience of a dis-
course entity have not been identified [Pri81, Pri85,
BF83, HTD86]. So an obvious question is when the
two algorithms actually make different predictions.
The main difference is that the choice of a co-specifier
for a pronoun in the Hobbs algorithm depends in part
on the position of that pronoun in the sentence. In
the centering framework, no matter what criteria one
uses to order the forward-centers list, pronouns take
the most salient entities as antecedents, irrespective
of that pronoun&apos;s position. Hobbs ordering of enti-
ties from a previous utterance varies from BFP in
that possessors come before case-marked objects and
indirect objects, and there may be some other differ-
ences as well but none of them were relevant to the
analysis that follows.
The effects ot some of the assumptions are mea-
surable and we will attempt to specify exactly what
these effects are, however some are not, e.g. we can-
not measure the effect of Hobbs&apos; syntax assumption
since it is difficult to say how likely one is to get the
wrong parse. We adopt the set collection assumption
for both algorithms as well as the ability to recover
the identity of speakers and hearers in dialogue.

2.2 Quantitative Results of the Algo-
rithms

<bodyText confidence="0.999981">
The texts on which the algorithms are analysed are
the first chapter of Arthur Hailey&apos;s novel Wheels, and
the July 7, 1975 edition of Newsweek. The sentences
in Wheels are short and simple with long sequences
consisting of reported conversation, so it is similar to
a conversational text. The articles from Newsweek
are typical of journalistic writing. For each text,
the first 100 occurrences of singular and plural third-
person pronouns were used to test the performance of
the algorithms. The task-dialogues contain a total of
81 uses of it and no other pronouns except for I and
you. In the figures below note that possessives like
his are counted along with he and that accusatives
like him and her are counted as he and she2.

(x2 = 3.25, not significant). In addition for each
algorithm alone we tested whether there were signif-
icant differences in performance for different textual
types. Both of the algorithms performed significantly
worse on the task dialogues (x2 = 22.05 for Hobbs,
x2 = 21.55 for BFP, p &lt; 0.05).
We might wonder with what confidence we should
view these numbers. A significant factor that must
be considered is the contribution of FALSE POSITIVES
and ERROR CHAINING. A FALSE POSITIVE is when
an algorithm gets the right answer for the wrong rea-
son. A very simple example of this phenomena is
illustrated by this sequence from one of the task dia-
logues.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.753691833333333">
Expi: Now put IT in the pan of water.
Exp2: Stand IT up.
Exp3: Pump the little handle with the red cap
on IT.
ok
Exp4. Does IT work??
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.948683735294118">
The first it in Expi refers to the pump. Hobbs
algorithm gets the right antecedent for it in Exp3,
which is the little handle, but then fails on it in Exp4,
whereas the BFP algorithm has the pump centered at
Expi and continues to select that as the antecedent
for it throughout the text. This means BFP gets the
wrong co-specifier in Exp3 but this error allows it to
get the correct co-specifier in Exp4.
Another type of false positive example is &amp;quot;Every-
body and HIS brother suddenly wants to be the Presi-
dent&apos;s friend,&amp;quot; said one aide. Hobbs gets this correct
as long as one is willing to accept that Everybody is
really the antecedent of his. It seems to me that this
might be an idiomatic use.
ERROR CHAINING refers to the fact that once an al-
gorithm makes an error, other errors can result. Con-
sider:
Sorry no luck.
Expi: I bet IT&apos;s the stupid red thing.
Exp2: Take IT out.
Cli2: Ok. IT is stuck.
In this example once an algorithm fails at Expi it
will fail on Exp2 and Cli2 as well since the choices of
a cospecifier in the following examples are dependent
on the choice in Expi.
It isn&apos;t possible to measure the effect of false pos-
itives, since in some sense they are subjective judge-
ments. However one can and should measure the ef-
fects of error chaining, since reporting numbers that
correct for error chaining is misleading, but if the er-
ror that produced the error chain can be corrected
then the algorithm might show a significant improve-
ment. In this analysis, error chains contributed 22
failures to Hobbs&apos; algorithm and 19 failures to BFP.

The numbers presented in the previous section are
intuitively unsatisfying. They tell us nothing about
what makes the algorithms more or less general, or
how they might be improved. In addition, given the
assumptions that we needed to make in order to pro-
duce them, one might wonder to what extent the data
is a result of these assumptions. Figure 1 also fails to
indicate whether the two algorithms missed the same
examples or are covering a different set of phenomena,
i.e. what the relative distribution of the successes and
failures are. But having done the hand-simulation in
order to produce such numbers, all of this informa-
tion is available. In this section we will first discuss
the relative importance of various factors that go into
producing the numbers above, then discuss if the al-
gorithms can be modified since the flexibility of a
framework in allowing one to make modifications is
an important dimension of evaluation.

There are 21 cases that Hobbs gets that BFP don&apos;t,
and of these these a few classes stand out. In ev-
ery case the relevant factor is Hobbs&apos; preference for
intrasentential co-specifiers.
One class, (n = 3), is exemplified by Put the lit-
tle black ring into the the large blue CAP with the
hole in IT. All three involved using the preposition
with in a descriptive adjunct on a noun phrase. It
may be that with-adjuncts are common in visual de-
scriptions, since they were only found in our data in
the task dialogues, and a quick inspection of Gross&apos;s
task-oriented dialogues revealed some as well[Deu74].
Another class, (n = 7), are possessives. In some
cases the possessive co-specified with the subject of
the sentence, e.g. The SENATE took time from
ITS paralyzing New Hampshire election debate to
vote agreement, and in others it was within a rela-
tive clause and co-specified with the subject of that
clause, e.g. The auto industry should be able to pro-
duce a totally safe, defect-free CAR that doesn&apos;t pol-
lute ITS environment.
Other cases seem to be syntactically marked sub-
ject matching with constructions that link two S
clauses (n = 8). These are uses of more-than in e.g.
but Chamberlain grossed about $8.3 million morethan
HE could have made by selling on the home front.
There also are S-if-S cases, as in Mondale said: &amp;quot;I
think THE MAFIA would be broke if IT conducted all
its business that way.&amp;quot; We also have subject match-
ing in AS-AS examples as in ... and the resulting EX-
POSURE to daylight has become as uncomfortable as
IT was unaccustomed, as well as in sentential com-
plements, such as But another liberal, Minnesota&apos;s
Walter MONDALE, said HE had found a lot of in-
competence in the agency&apos;s operations. The fact that
quite a few of these are also marked with But may be
significant.
In terms of the possible effects that we noted ear-

K: Next take the red piece that is the small-
est and insert it into the hole in the side of
the large plastic tube. IT goes in the hole
nearest the end with the engravings on IT.
The Hobbs algorithm will correctly choose the end
as the antecedent for the second it. The BFP al-
gorithm on the other hand will get two interpreta-
tions, one in which the second it co-specifies the red
piece and one in which it co-specifies the end. They
are both CONTINUING interpretations since the first
it co-specifies the CB, but the constraints don&apos;t make
a choice.

though the whole segment has been about the blue
cap.
Another example from the novel WHEELS is given
below. On this one Hobbs gets the first use of he
but then misses the next four, as a result of missing
the second one by choosing a housekeeper as the co-
specifier for HIS.
..An executive vice-president of Ford was
preparing to leave for Detroit Metropoli-
tan Airport. HE had already breakfasted,
alone. A housekeeper had brought a tray to
HIS desk in the softly lighted study where,
since 5 a.m., HE had been alternately read-
ing memoranda (mostly on special blue sta-
tionery which Ford vice-presidents used in
implementing policy) and dictating crisp in-
structions into a recording machine. HE had
scarcely looked up, either as the mail ar-
rived, or while eating, as HE accomplished
in an hour what would have taken...
Since an executive vice-president is centered in the
first sentence, and continued in each following sen-
tence, the BFP algorithm will correctly choose the
cospecifier.

Among the examples that neither algorithm gets cor-
rectly are 20 examples from the task dialogues of it
referring to the global focus, the pump. In 15 cases,
these shifts to global focus are marked syntactically
with a cue word such as Now, and are not marked
in 5 cases. Presumably they are felicitous since the
pump is visually salient. Besides the global focus
cases, pronominal references to entities that were not
linguistically introduced are rare. The only other ex-
ample is an implicit reference to &apos;the problem&apos; of the
pump not working:
Clii: Sorry no luck.
Expi: I bet IT&apos;s the stupid red thing.
We have only two examples of sentential or VP
anaphora altogether, such as Madam Chairwoman,
said Colby at last, I am trying to run a secret intelli-
gence service. IT was a forlorn hope. Neither Hobbs
algorithm nor BFP attempt to cover these examples.
Three of the examples are uses of it that seem to
be lexicalized with certain verbs, e.g. They hit IT
off real well. One can imagine these being treated as
phrasal lexical items, and therefore not handled by
an anaphoric processing component[AS89].
Most of the interchanges in the task dialogues con-
sist of the client responding to commands with cues
such as O.K. or Ready to let the expert know when
they have completed a task. When both parties
contribute discourse entities to the common ground,
both algorithms may fail (n = 4).
Consider:
Expi: Now we have a little red piece left
Exp2: and I don&apos;t know what to do with IT.
CHI: Well, there is a hole in the green plunger
inside the cylinder.
Exp3: I don&apos;t think IT goes in THERE.
Exp4: I think IT may belong in the blue cap
onto which you put the pink piece
of plastic.
In Exp3, one might claim that it and there are con-
traindexed, and that there can be properly resolved
to a hole, so that it cannot be any of the noun phrases
in the prepositional phrases that modify a hole, but
whether any theory of contra-indexing actually give
us this is questionable.
The main factor seems to be that even though
Expi is not syntactically a question, the little red
piece is the focus of a question, and as such is in
focus despite the fact that the syntactic construction
there is supposedly focuses a hole in the green plunger
...[Sid79]. These examples suggest that a questioned
entity is left focused until the point in the dialogue at
which the question is resolved. The fact that well has
been noted as a marker of response to questions sup-
ports this analysis[Sch87]. Thus the relevant factor
here may be the switching of control among discourse
participants [WS88]. These mixed-initiative features
make these sequences inherently different than text.

3.2 Modifiability
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998968">
Task structure in the pump dialogues is an important
factor especially as it relates to the use of global focus.
Twenty of the cases on which both algorithms fail are
references to the pump, which is the global focus. We
can include a global focus in the centering framework,
as a separate notion from the current CB. This means
that in the 15 out of 20 cases where the shift to global
focus is identifiably marked with a cue-word such as
now, the segment rules will allow BFP to get the
global focus examples.

forward centers list, as Sidner does in her algorithm
for local focusing [Sid79]. This lets BFP get the two
examples of event anaphora. Hobbs discusses the fact
that his algorithm cannot be modified to get event
anaphora in [Hob76b].
Another interesting fact is that in every case in
which Hobbs&apos; algorithm gets the correct co-specifier
and BFP didn&apos;t, the relevant factor is Hobbs&apos; pref-
erence for intrasentential co-specifiers. One view
on these cases may be that these are not discourse
anaphora, but there seems to be no principled way
to make this distinction. However, Carter has pro-
posed some extensions to Sidner&apos;s algorithm for lo-
cal focusing that seem to be relevant here(chap. 6,
[Car87]). He argues that intra-sentential candidates
(ISCs) should be preferred over candidates from the
previous utterance, ONLY in the cases where no dis-
course center has been established or the discourse
center is rejected for syntactic or selectional reasons.
He then uses Hobbs algorithm to produce an ordering
of these ISCs. This is compatible with the centering
framework since it is underspecified as to whether one
should always choose to establish a discourse center
with a co-specifier from a previous utterance. If we
adopt Carter&apos;s rule into the centering framework, we
find that of the 21 cases that Hobbs gets that BFP
don&apos;t, in 7 cases there is no discourse center estab-
lished, and in another 4 the current center can be re-
jected on the basis of syntactic or sortal information.
Of these Carter&apos;s rule clearly gets 5, and another 3
seem to rest on whether one might want to establish
a discourse entity from a previous utterance. Since
the addition of this constraint does not allow BFP to
get any examples that neither algorithm got, it seems
that this combination is a way of making the best out
of both algorithms.
The addition of these modifications changes the
quantitative results. See the Figure 5.

However, the statistical analyses still show that
there is no significant difference in the performance
of the algorithms in general. It is also still the case
that the performance of each algorithm significantly
varies depending on the data. The only significant
difference as a result of the modifications is that the
BFP algorithm now performs significantly better on
the pump dialogues alone (x2 = 4.31,p &lt; .05).

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999731627906977">
We can benefit in two ways from performing such
evaluations: (a) we get general results on a methodol-
ogy for doing evaluation, (b) we discover ways we can
improve current theories. A split of evaluation efforts
into quantitative versus qualitative is incoherent. We
cannot trust the results of a quantitative evaluation
without doing a considerable amount of qualitative
analyses and we should perform our qualitative anal-
yses on those components that make a significant con-
tribution to the quantitative results; we need to be
able to measure the effect of various factors. These
measurements must be made by doing comparisons
at the data level.
In terms of general results, we have identified some
factors that make evaluations of this type more com-
plicated and which might lead us to evaluate solely
quantitative results with care. These are: (a) To de-
cide how to evaluate UNDERSPECIFICATIONS and the
contribution of ASSUMPTIONS, and (b) To determine
the effects of FALSE POSITIVES and ERROR CHAINING.
We advocate an approach in which the contribution
of each underspecification and assumption is tabu-
lated as well as the effect of error chains. If a prin-
cipled way could be found to identify false positives,
their effect should be reported as well as part of any
quantitative evaluation.
In addition, we have taken a few steps towards de-
termining the relative importance of different factors
to the successful operation of discourse modules. The
percent of successes that both algorithms get indi-
cates that syntax has a strong influence, and that at
the very least we can reduce the amount of inference
required. In 59% to 82% of the cases both algorithms
get the correct result. This probably means that in a
large number of cases there was no potential conflict
of co-specifiers. In addition, this analysis has shown,
that at least for task-oriented dialogues global focus
is a significant factor, and in general discourse struc-
ture is more important in the task dialogues. How-
ever simple devices such as cue words may go a long
way toward determining this structure.
Finally, we should note that doing evaluations such
as this allows us to determine the GENERALITY of our

<bodyText confidence="0.999951888888889">
approaches. Since the performance of both Hobbs
and BFP varies according to the type of the text, and
in fact was significantly worse on the task dialogues
than on the texts, we might question how their per-
formance would vary on other inputs. An annotated
corpus comprising some of the various NL input types
such as those I discussed in the introduction would
go a long way towards giving us a basis against which
we could evaluate the generality of our theories.

We illustrate the general difficulties encountered with quantitative evaluation.
