1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.98161511627907">
In the last couple of years our group at DFKI in
Saarbr¨ucken has been involved in a number of projects
aiming at interfacing different devices in an intelligent
way. The main goal of these projects has been to build
functioning robust systems with which it is natural to
communicate (not only for some few examples phrases).
During the projects we have developed a dialogue tool-
box consisting of a number of modules. By combining
these modules in different ways we are able to realize a
number of different types of dialogues, e. g., information
seeking/browsing, device control, multi/cross-application
and agent-mediated interactions for a number of (diverse)
applications and systems. The full-blown combination of
all modules form our dialogue backbone capable of en-
gaging in multimodal man–machine communication.
In this paper, we discuss some of the design decisions
taken along the road as well as lessons learned during the
projects. Based on our experiences, we argue that ends-
based processing is vital to the success of our approach.
We strive for a balance between complex theories and
pragmatic decisions. Of secondary interest is the imple-
mentation of theories capable of processing linguistically
exotic phenomena in favor of ends-based processing in
all modules of the toolbox. Hence it is more important to
reach the representation rather than how we get there.
An ontology is often – as we understand it – a good
ends-based representation but we can do without it. In
the MIAMM project (see section 2) we use no ontology

but instead an event based representation. Whatever rep-
resentation we do choose, we would like to stress the im-
portance of a consequent principle-based design of the
representation and the fact that the complete backbone
uses it. Exactly this guarantees, e. g., the scalability of
our approach.
The paper is organized as follows: the next section pro-
vides an overview of projects and systems central to the
development of our toolbox. Section 3 describes most of
its modules. Before we conclude the paper, we provide a
list of claims and lessons learned in section 4.

In this paper, we describe a toolbox which we can cus-
tomize according to the projects needs. Using this tool-
box we have implemented a number of systems, all hav-
ing different requirements, needs and ends. They range
from (monomodal) typed input/output as in the NaRATo
project to multimodal agent-mediated communication as
in SmartKom. Below we describe the different projects
and systems showing that we are able to cover several
kinds of communication paradigm.

SmartKom
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99738995">
SMARTKOM is a mixed-initiative dialogue system that
provides full symmetric multimodality by combining
speech, gesture, and facial expressions for both user in-
put and system output (Wahlster, 2003). It provides
an anthropomorphic and affective user interface through
its personification of an embodied conversational agent,
called Smartakus. The interaction metaphor is based
on the so-called situated, delegation-oriented dialogue
paradigm: the user delegates a task to a virtual commu-
nication assistant which is visualized as a life-like char-
acter. The interface agent recognizes the user’s inten-
tions and goals, asks the user for feedback if necessary,
accesses the various services on behalf of the user, and
presents the results in an adequate manner. Non-verbal
reactions of the users are extracted from their facial ex-
pression or the prosodic features and affect subsequent
system presentations.
As it is depicted in Figure 1, SMARTKOM realizes a
flexible and adaptive shell for multimodal dialogues and
addresses three different application scenarios:

tion scenarios

<bodyText confidence="0.999942782608696">
SMARTKOM PUBLIC realizes an advanced multimodal
information and communication kiosk for, e. g., shop-
ping malls. The user can get information about movies,
reserve seats in a theater, and communicate using
telephone, fax, or electronic mail. Before the sys-
tem grants access to personal data, e. g., an address
book, the user has to authenticate himself using either
hand contour recognition, signature or voice verification.
SMARTKOM HOME serves as a multimodal infotainment
companion for the home theater. A portable web-pad acts
as an advanced remote control where the user gets pro-
gramming information from an electronic program guide
service and easily controls consumer electronics devices
like a TV set or a VCR. Similar to the kiosk application,
the user may also use communication services at home.
SMARTKOM MOBILE realizes a mobile travel compan-
ion for navigation and location-based services. It uses a
PDA as a front end which can be added to a car navigation
system. This system offers services like integrated trip
planning and incremental route guidance. In the mobile
scenario speech input can be combined with pen-based
pointing.
All functionalities, modality combinations and techni-
cal realizations including a wide variety of hardware op-
tions for the periphery are addressed by the same core di-
alogue system with common shared knowledge sources.
The processing relies on a knowledge based, configurable
approach: we provide general solutions based on declar-
ative knowledge sources in favour for special solutions
and/or shortcuts or application specific procedural pro-
cessing steps within the dialogue core of the system.
The interaction processing is based on M3L (Multimodal
Markup Language), a complete XML language designed
in the context of SMARTKOM that covers all data in-
terfaces within the complex multimodal dialogue sys-
tem (Gurevych et al., 2003a). The technical realization
is based on the MULTIPLATFORM testbed (Herzog et
al., 2004), an integration platform that provides a dis-
tributed component architecture. MULTIPLATFORM is
implemented on the basis of the scalable and efficient
publish/subscribe approach that decouples data produc-
ers and data consumers. Software modules communicate
via so-called data pools that correspond to named mes-
sage queues. Every data pool can be linked to an individ-
ual data type specification in order to define admissible
message contents.

MIAMM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998905">
The main objective of the MIAMM project is to de-
velop new concepts and techniques in the field of multi-
modal interaction to allow fast and natural access to large
multimedia databases (Reithinger et al., 2003b). This
implies both the integration of available technologies in
the domain of speech interaction (Natural Language Un-
derstanding — SPIN — see section 3.1) and interaction
management (Action Planner — AP — see section 3.3)
and the design of novel technology for haptic designation
and manipulation coupled with an adequate visualization.
The envisioned end-user device is a hand-held PDA that
provides an interface to a music database. The device in-
cludes three force-feedback buttons on the left side and
one wheel on the upper right side (see figure 2). The
buttons allow navigation through the visualized data, and
performing of various actions on the presented objects
(e. g., select, play).
The MIAMM architecture follows the ”standard” ar-
chitecture of interactive systems, with the consecutive
steps mode analysis, mode coordination, interaction man-
agement, presentation planning, and mode design. To
cope with artefacts arising from processing time require-
ments and coordination of different processes, this archi-
tecture was modified, so that only events that are rele-
vant to other modules are sent, whereas the others remain
internal. Thus, haptic interaction is decoupled from the
more time-consuming speech processes, and only sends
feedback when it is needed for the resolution of under-
specified structures or when the interaction involves ex-
ternal actions, e. g., playing a selected track. The sys-
tem consists of two modules for natural language input
processing, namely recognition and interpretation. On
the output side an MP3 player is used to play the songs
and the pre-recorded speech prompts to provide acoustic
feedback. The visual-haptic-tactile module is responsi-
ble for the selection of the visualization, and for the as-
signment of haptic features to the force-feedback buttons.
The visualization module renders the graphic output and
interprets the force imposed by the user to the haptic but-
tons. The dialogue manager consists of two main blocks,

the multimodal FUSION (see section 3.2) which is re-
sponsible for the resolution of multimodal references us-
ing the contextual information hold in the dialogue his-
tory, and the AP, that interprets the user intention and trig-
gers a suitable system response. The AP is connected via
a domain model to the multimedia database. The domain
model uses an inference engine that facilitates access to
the database.
The integration environment is based on the Simple
Object Access Protocol (SOAP) (see www.w3.org/
TR/SOAP). The communication between the modules
is based on the multimodal interface language (MMIL).
This specification accounts for the incremental integra-
tion of multimodal data to achieve a full understanding
of the multimodal acts within the system. It is flexible
enough to handle the various types of information pro-
cessed and generated by the different modules.

COMIC is an European IST 5th framework project fo-
cusing on new methods of work and e-commerce (den
Os and Boves, 2003). Goal of this project is to develop
a user centric, multimodal interface for a bathroom de-
sign tool which was developed by the COMIC partner Vi-
Soft (see www.visoft.de). The implementation work
is accompanied by research in the cognitive aspects of
human-human and human-computer interaction.

for this project all other modules are provided by other
partners. COMIC is also based on MULTIPLATFORM as
the integration middleware, allowing a reuse of the mod-
ule wrappers and engines. The representation of infor-
mation is similar to that of SMARTKOM although the ac-
tual ontology differs in significant parts (e. g., no upper
model). Hence the integration of SPIN and Generation
was limited to the revision and adaption of the language
and ontology dependent knowledge sources. FUSION,
however, needed a deeper adaption as outlined in section
3.2.
Yet another (kind of) system
For the system NaRATo we have used parts of our tool-
box – language understanding, discourse modeling , ac-
tion planning, and generation – for a dialogue system in-
terfacing the ARIS tool-set, a business process manage-
ment system (see www.ids-scheer.com). The sys-
tem uses typed input and output to provide access to a
given process model stored in a database.

3 A Number of Modules
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999145516129032">
Our toolbox deploys a number of modules which are con-
nected in a (nowadays) standard fashion (see figure 4).
The input channels are fused by the modality fusion. This
module is also responsible for resolving not just deictic
expressions using gesture and speech but also referen-
tial expressions involving the dialogue context. The dis-
course module is the central repository for modality de-
pendent and modality independent information. Here, the

user contribution is interpreted in context which involves
resolving, e. g., a wide range of elliptical contributions.
The action planner is the actual engine: using a regres-
sion planning approach the next system action is planned
possibly preceeded by access of some external device. Fi-
nally, the presentation manager renders the system action.
Here, the availability of different output modalities and
the situation are influencing the realization of the action.
Our architecture differs from that of (Blaylock et al.,
2003) in that the responsibility of the next system ac-
tion is in our case purely decided by the action planner;
the approach has some similarities with the one taken in
(Larsson, 2002) in that most communicative actions rep-
resent request-response interactions along goals (akin to
QUDs), and there is a notion of information state, which
is however kept separated between the discourse mod-
eler (for information specific to dialogue content, roughly
equivalent to the SHARED information in IBiS) and the
action planner (for other information, such as the agenda
of the dialogue engine).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998722">
3.1 Natural Language Understanding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976472727273">
The task of the natural language understanding module is
to transform the output of the speech recognizer into a list
of possible user intentions which are already represented
in the system-wide high-level ontology (see section 4).
For this task a new template-based semantic parsing ap-
proach called SPIN (Engel, 2002) was developed at DFKI
and is used in all aforementioned projects.
As typical for a semantic parser, the approach does not
need a syntactic analysis, but the high level output struc-
ture is built up directly from word level. This is feasi-
ble since the input consists of spoken utterances intended
to interact with a computer system and therefore, they
are usually syntactically less complicated and limited in
length. Furthermore, the lack of a syntactical analysis in-
creases the robustness against speech recognition errors
(speaker independent recognizers still have a word error
rate of 10%-30%) and syntactically incorrect input by the
user.
SPIN differs from other existing semantic parsing ap-
proaches by providing a more powerful rule language
and a powerful built-in ontology formalism. The main
motivation for the powerful rule language is to simplify
the creation and maintenance of rules. As the amount
of required rules is quite large (e.g., in the SmartKom
project 435 templates are used), easy creation and main-
tenance of the rules is one of the most important issues for
parsers in dialogue systems. Additionally, high-level out-
put structures have to be generated and these output struc-
tures may be structurally quite different from the implied
structure of the input utterance. A powerful rule language
simplifies this task significantly.
Several off-line optimizations still provide fast pro-
cessing despite the increased rule power. The most im-
portant off-line optimization is the computation of a fixed
rule application order with the objective to avoid wasting
time by the generation of sub-optimal results.
The powerful built-in ontology formalism helps to in-
tegrate the module in dialogue systems by only creating
the knowledge bases and an interface layer but without
any changes in the code base. Due to the lack of a stan-
dard ontology formalism for dialogue systems, each di-
alogue system uses a slightly different formalism. The
powerful internal ontology formalism simplifies the task
of mapping the system-wide ontology formalism to the
internal one.
Current research will improve the approach in two ar-
eas. First, the time-consuming creation of the knowl-
edge bases which has to be done completely manually
up to now will be supported by machine learning tech-
niques. Second, the external linguistic preprocessing of
the speech recognizer output, like a syntactic analysis,
will be possible without incorporating linguistic informa-
tion into the knowledge bases. This would allow to pro-
cess syntactically more complicated user utterances and
still provides easy creation of the knowledge bases.

3.2 Modality Fusion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999727137931035">
Multimodal dialogue systems like SmartKom or Comic
give users the opportunity to express their needs not only
by speech but also by different modalities, e. g., by ges-
turing or by using a pen. Furthermore, users can also
combine several modalities to express one multimodal ut-
terance (e. g., “I want to start here” accompanied by a
pointing gesture towards a location on a map). As the rec-
ognizers and analyzers of the different modalities gener-
ate modality specific hypotheses, a component is needed
to synchronize and integrate those monomodal hypothe-
ses into multimodal ones. This module is called FUSION.
Based on human-human communication research,
e. g., (Oviatt, 1999), we can identify four basic interac-
tion patterns of how to use different modalities within a
single multimodal utterance:
redundant the information provided by two modalities
is basically the same,
concurrent two modalities are used one after another to
provide information,
complementary the information provided by two
modalities can be intertwined,
contradicting the information provided by one modality
is contradictory to the information provided by the other
modality.
All these interaction patterns can be resolved by ob-
taining access to information about the internal structure
of objects. Especially when having to integrate informa-
tion from one source into another, we need to know what
specific objects look like, e. g., which sub-objects they

comprise. This information is typically provided by an
ontology, e. g., via the type hierarchy and the slot defini-
tions of each object. So, what FUSION must accomplish
is to utilize processing strategies based on a type hierar-
chy and a given set of object definitions.
In SmartKom we applied a so called slot-filling ap-
proach for the integration of the two modalities speech
and gesture. Multimodal hypotheses are compiled by in-
serting the hypotheses of the gestural modality into the
hypotheses of the speech modality. The advantage of this
approach is that apart from an ontology no further knowl-
edge sources are required. This approach proved to be
very fast and robust. However, the drawback is that an
adaption to a different dialogue system or to new modal-
ities is quite expensive.
With respect to our overall goal of building a scal-
able and reusable core dialogue system, we uncoupled
the core FUSION system from the needs of the dialogue
system, the available modalities, and processing strate-
gies. Thus, we implemented a special purpose production
rule system. Key to this approach is that all processing
strategies are defined by production rules which can be
easily created and adapted to the new surroundings and
there are two powerful operations for accumulating in-
formation – unification and overlay (Alexandersson and
Becker, 2003).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999375">
3.3 Action Planning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999553630769231">
Task oriented cooperative dialogues, where participants
collaborate to achieve a common goal, can be viewed
as coherent sequences of utterances asking for actions to
be performed or introducing new information to the di-
alogue context. The task of the action planner is to rec-
ognize the user’s goal, to trigger required actions for its
achievement, and to devise appropriate sub-dialogues and
feedback. The actions can be internal, such as updating
the internal state of the system, or external, like database
queries, device operation or communication with the user.
Thus, the action planner controls both the task and the
interaction structure. Task and dialogue interactions are
viewed as joint communicative games played with dif-
ferent agents, including the user and all modules that di-
rectly communicate with the action planner.2 Participants
are abstractly represented by communication channels
transforming between the uniform internal representation
of communicative moves to the data structures used by
external participants. Each game is composed of a num-
ber of moves, defined by dialogue knowledge sources.
The game definitions are similar to STRIPS plan opera-
tors. They specify sets of preconditions and effects, and
additionally, for each move the channel through which
the data flows, and data structures containing the seman-
tic content of the move intention. The adoption of a dia-
logue goal triggers a planning process (non-linear regres-
sion planning, with hierarchical decomposition of sub-
goals) resulting in a series of communicative games to
be played to achieve the goal. Move execution is then
interleaved with checking their outcome, and possibly re-
planning if preconditions are violated. This strategy al-
lows the system to deal with unexpected user inputs like
misunderstandings or changing of goals.
The approach of planning with communicative games
has two benefits with respect to the scalability of the sys-
tem, one regarding communication channels, the other
stemming from the use of small dialogue game units.
It is possible to integrate support for any number of ad-
ditional devices to an already existing system by adding
new communication channels (one Java class each); di-
alogue moves that do not use these channels will not be
affected. Still, dialogue specifications for newly added
devices can make use of the already defined ones.
As described above, the dialogue behavior is coded
in terms of communicative games consisting of dialogue
moves. For predetermined sequences of moves (e. g., a

alogue games,” since our dialogue model also includes com-
munication interaction with applications and devices, such as
database requests and answers, in terms of game moves.
fixed protocol for sending fax messages: (1) scan docu-
ment, (2) convert to fax format, (3) send it via fax ap-
plication), the dialogue game can resemble a fixed script,
like the pre-made plans used, e. g., by (Larsson, 2002)),
but in general, games specify atomic steps like single
request-response subdialogues. To devise the course of
action, a plan is then constructed dynamically as a game
sequence. This has the advantage that (1) the plan can be
flexibly adapted to changed circumstances, e. g., if a step
becomes obsolete or is addressed early, and (2) games
can be shared and reused as building blocks for other
applications. So, when new functionality is integrated,
the plan knowledge source will stay reasonably small–
growing linearly in the number of games, not exponen-
tially with the possible recipes.3

3.4 Discourse Modeling
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999471382352941">
The main objective of the discourse modeler (henceforth
DIM) is to incorporate information stemming from the
previous discourse context into the current intention hy-
potheses produced by the analysis modules. This objec-
tive decomposes into two main tasks which are on the
one hand enhancing a hypothesis with compatible back-
ground information and estimating how well it fits the
previous discourse context – what we call enrichment and
validation – and on the other hand the resolution of refer-
ring expressions.
Discourse processing in the framework of a multi-
modal dialogue system has to deal with an extended set
of input and output devices. Gestures, for example, ac-
companying speech not only support the resolution of re-
ferring expressions, in addition they change the discourse
context. In general, the resolution of referring expres-
sions within a multimodal approach requires access to a
visual context representation. One key aspect of DIM is
a unified context representation taking both the discourse
and the visual context into account.
Our approach consists of a three-tiered discourse rep-
resentation combined with a two layered focus handling,
see (Pfleger et al., 2003). The actual processing is
done by utilizing two operations: unification and over-
lay (Alexandersson and Becker, 2003). In combination
with a scoring function (Pfleger et al., 2002), the latter
is our main tool for enrichment and validation. Key to
this approach is that DIM can be easily adapted to other
dialogue systems with different tasks and demands. In
that sense, the actual context representation is indepen-
dent from the type of objects to be stored. Additionally,
DIM can be used not only within a multimodal dialogue
system but also within monomodal ones, as we showed
in the NaRATo project.

<footnote confidence="0.810910666666667">
3The usual downside is, the planning space is of course ex-
ponential. But as we use goal-directed search, only a small frac-
tion of the possible plans is ever examined in practice.

3.5 Modality Fission
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999948">
The modalities used in the SmartKom system are ges-
ture, mimics, speech and also graphical presentations on
devices of different sizes. The main task of multimodal
fission is partitioning, i. e., dividing the presentation tasks
into subtasks and generating an execution plan. A follow-
up task is then the coordination and synchronization of re-
lated tasks, e. g., presentation of a graphical element with
a pointing gesture and synchronization with speech.
The fission module is embedded in a presentation plan-
ner that also subsumes the graphical realization task. The
module generates a full plan for graphics, gesture and
mimics while the plan for speech is generated only on an
abstract subtask level that is handed as input to the Text
Generator (see next section).
The planning of a multimodal presentation consists of
two parts: static gesture-sensitive graphical elements and
a corresponding multimodal animation of the agent in-
cluding gestures referring to objects with aligned audio-
visual speech output. The first step performed on the in-
put is a transformation into the internal input format of
the core planning component PrePlan by applying an ap-
propriate XSLT-stylesheet.
Then, the presentation planner starts the planning pro-
cess by applying a set of presentation strategies which
define how the facts are presented in the given scenario.
Based on constraints, the strategies decompose the com-
plex presentation goal into primitive tasks and at the same
time they execute the media fission step depending on
available modalities, which means they decide which part
of the presentation should be instantiated as spoken out-
put, graphics, or gestures of our presentation agent.
After planning the graphical presentation, appropriate
speech and gesture presentations are generated. The ges-
ture and speech form is chosen depending on the graph-
ically shown information. I.e., if the graphically pre-
sented information is in the focus of a presentation, only
a comment is generated in speech output. The goal of the
gesture presentation is then to focus on the appropriate
graphical element. If there is no graphically presentable
information or it is insufficient, more speech is generated.

3.6 Natural Language Generator
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919230769231">
The design of the Natural Language Generation (NLG)
module is guided by the need to (i) adapt only knowledge
sources when adding a new application and (ii) general-
izing the knowledge sources from the applications.
Thus the NLG module is divided into an engine and
declarative knowledge sources which are designed with
the goal of capturing generalizations. The input to the
NLG module are abstract presentation goals that are
based on the ends-based presentation; the output is (an-
notated) text that typically is sent to a speech synthesizer.
E.g., the NLG module in SmartKom uses syntactic struc-
ture and discourse information to supply richly annotated
text for the Concept-To-Speech (CTS) approach.
On the one hand, the NLG module is templated–based
(see also SPIN), skipping multiple layers of represen-
tation when mapping from the presentation goals. On
the other hand, the templates are “fully specified” in
the sense that they include intermediate layers of rep-
resentation where possible to permit a later separation
of rules into a multi-stage generation module. E.g., in-
cluding syntax was also necessary for CTS, including se-
mantics allows for the extraction of a realization module
for COMIC. The template rules are based on the same
PrePlan planning component used in fission. At least
since (Reiter, 1995) the use of templates and “deep rep-
resentations” is not seen as a contradiction. Picking up
on this idea, the generation component in SmartKom is
based on fully lexicalized generation (Becker, 1998), us-
ing partial derivation trees of a Tree-Adjoining Grammar
(TAG). Right from the beginning of development, deriva-
tion trees which are seen as reflecting syntactic depen-
dencies have been an explicitly represented layer in the
template rules. Thus the higher level planning rules de-
cide content selection, sentence plans and lexicalization,
leaving syntactic realization to a TAG-based second step.
During development, we have enriched the syntactic
trees with nested feature structures and have just finished
a transformation of the phrasal templates to a fully lexi-
calized TAG, where every lexical item has its unique tree.

4 Ends-Based Processing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933828947369">
One of the most important constraints when building a
functioning system has been the domain of the appli-
cation. Based on the domain we developed ends-based
representations which have so far mostly been ontolo-
gies or ontology-like structures, e. g., (Gurevych et al.,
2003b) but which in fact could be event-based represen-
tations as well. How interpretation and presentation are
connected to the abstract representation is of secondary
interest; Our backbone uses this task-oriented represen-
tation for communication and processing and the way
there and back may exclude, for instance, traditional se-
mantics. We make two important observations: on the
one hand, that the complete backbone should use a sin-
gle representation, so that translations between different
representations are avoided. Important here is that each
module (ideally) separates its engine from its knowledge
base. On the other hand, the common representation has
to be ends-based and fulfil the needs of the application.
The latter point leads us to another lesson learned: The
application has to be examined and its needs have to be
mirrored in the representation. We also have to deter-
mine what interactions we are aiming for. Since, e. g., in
SmartKom, we pursue a situated delegation-oriented dia-
log paradigm – meaning that the system is in itself not a
dialogue partner as in (Blaylock et al., 2003) but instead
the dialogue is mediated by an animated agent – we en-
capsulate the details of the application APIs in an applica-
tion manager and hence provide a user-oriented view of
the application(s). Additionally, the dialogue plans are
represented separately from the ends-based representa-
tion in a different knowledge base, i. e., the plan speci-
fications for the action planner. However, the plans refer
to the application using the ends-based representation.
We have acquired our knowledge, e. g., ends-based
represenations or interpretation rules completely by hand.
While we avoid the potentially costly resources for the
collection and annotation of corpora for automated lear-
ning4, the question remains whether expanding knowl-
edge sources by hand is feasible. Our approach has in-
deed allowed for scaling up – in SmartKom we have ex-
tended the system to more than 50 functionalities overall
(Reithinger et al., 2003a).
In the following, we list the most important lessons we
learned, which is by no means exhaustive:
Encapsulation Encapsulate the backbone from the ap-
plication(s). This was one of the main lessons from the
NaRATo and the SmartKom projects. We did not do it in
the NaRATo project and spent lots of time interfacing the
database. In SmartKom, such a module exists, and the
backbone developers could concentrate on more relevant
tasks in dialogue processing proper.
Representation Use one representation throughout the
backbone. It is a secondary question how exactly it is
done, but it is essential that you get there and avoid spend-
ing time on converting between different formalisms.
Representation (revisited) There is to be no presentation
(system output) without representation on the ends-based
representation level. This representation is part of the
global dialogue history residing in the discourse module
and can be accessed by any module, e. g., for reference
resolution at any time during the course of the dialogue.
Interface In the case of a multi-module approach, use
one well-defined representation for module communica-
tion. In most cases we have used XML and XML Schema
which is convenient because a wide variety of infrastruc-
ture and tools is available. For instance, most XML pro-
cessing tools allow for syntactic validation. However,
XML is not mandatory. A final remark here: using XML
in combination with stylesheets, we can in fact – contrary
to the advice in Representation (above) – translate or con-
vert messages to some internal representation easily.
Interface (revisited) Interfaces should be clean and well-
defined. One reason for the success of the SmartKom
project was the requirement to define every interface for-
mally by XML Schema. These XML Schemata were kept
in a project-wide repository and changed at this one place

after mutual agreement only. Due to the multi-blackboard
approach, there are not point-to-point connections, but -
to- connections, and an interface definition comprises
of a precise description of what is supposed to be an al-
lowed message for a specific blackboard.
Integration Our large projects have profited enormously
of a dedicated integration group providing infrastructure,
integration cycles and – for, e. g., the SmartKom and
COMIC systems – a testbed (Herzog et al., 2004).
Multimodality More modalities allow for more natural
communication, which normally employs multiple chan-
nels of expression, suited to the content to be communi-
cated. For natural language processing per se this raises
new and interesting challenges, e. g., cross-modal refer-
ential expressions. It is also the case that more modal-
ities constrain interpretation and hence enhance robust-
ness. The ends-based representation allow for modality-
independent processing in the backbone.
Standards Standards ease scalability. For, e. g., ends-
based representations and tools, we have previously de-
veloped custom-built software providing short-lived so-
lutions. In other situations we have chosen standards and
standard tools. We claim that the latter is beneficial in at
least two ways: It opens up the door for scalability since
we can re-use our as well as other’s resources. Secondly
it is easier to maintain our solution over time and projects.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997362">
DFKI’s dialogue toolbox was used in a number of fully
functional, differently sized systems with a variety of
interaction paradigms. Vital to its success in terms of
reusability and scalability was the choice of a modular de-
sign and ends-based representations throughout the com-
plete backbone. Starting from basic functionalities, it is
possible to extend the system coverage while incorporat-
ing new features. Future work includes reusing (parts of)
the backbone in EU and nationally funded large projects
like AMI, TALK, Inscape, VirtualHuman and SmartWeb.

With respect to our overall goal of building a scalable and reusable core dialogue system, we uncoupled the core FUSION system from the needs of the dialogue system, the available modalities, and processing strategies. Thus, we implemented a special purpose production rule system. Key to this approach is that all processing strategies are defined by production rules which can be easily created and adapted to the new surroundings and there are two powerful operations for accumulating information – unification and overlay (Alexandersson and Becker, 2003). 3.3 Action Planning Task oriented cooperative dialogues, where participants collaborate to achieve a common goal, can be viewed as coherent sequences of utterances asking for actions to be performed or introducing new information to the dialogue context. The task of the action planner is to recognize the user’s goal, to trigger required actions for its achievement, and to devise appropriate sub-dialogues and feedback. The actions can be internal, such as updating the internal state of the system, or external, like database queries, device operation or communication with the user. Thus, the a</context>

In general, the resolution of referring expressions within a multimodal approach requires access to a visual context representation. One key aspect of DIM is a unified context representation taking both the discourse and the visual context into account. Our approach consists of a three-tiered discourse representation combined with a two layered focus handling, see (Pfleger et al., 2003). The actual processing is done by utilizing two operations: unification and overlay (Alexandersson and Becker, 2003). In combination with a scoring function (Pfleger et al., 2002), the latter is our main tool for enrichment and validation. Key to this approach is that DIM can be easily adapted to other dialogue systems with different tasks and demands. In that sense, the actual context representation is independent from the type of objects to be stored. Additionally, DIM can be used not only within a multimodal dialogue system but also within monomodal ones, as we showed in the NaRATo project. 3The usual downside is, the planning space is of course exponential. But as we use goal-directed search, only a sma</context>

E.g., including syntax was also necessary for CTS, including semantics allows for the extraction of a realization module for COMIC. The template rules are based on the same PrePlan planning component used in fission. At least since (Reiter, 1995) the use of templates and “deep representations” is not seen as a contradiction.

The action planner is the actual engine: using a regression planning approach the next system action is planned possibly preceeded by access of some external device. Finally, the presentation manager renders the system action. Here, the availability of different output modalities and the situation are influencing the realization of the action. Our architecture differs from that of (Blaylock et al., 2003) in that the responsibility of the next system action is in our case purely decided by the action planner; the approach has some similarities with the one taken in (Larsson, 2002) in that most communicative actions represent request-response interactions along goals (akin to QUDs), and there is a notion of information state, which is however kept separated between the discourse modeler (for information specific to dialogue content, roughly equivalent to the SHARED information in IBiS) and the action planner (for other information, such as the agenda of the dialogue engine). 3.1 Natural Languag</context>

For this task a new template-based semantic parsing approach called SPIN (Engel, 2002) was developed at DFKI and is used in all aforementioned projects. As typical for a semantic parser, the approach does not need a syntactic analysis, but the high level output structure is built up directly from word level. This is feasible since the input consists of spoken utterances intended to interact with a computer system and therefore, they are usually syntactically less complicated and limited in length. Furthermore, the lack of a syntactical analysis increases the robustness against speech recognition errors (speaker independent recognizers still have a word error rate of 10%-30%) an</context>

Software modules communicate via so-called data pools that correspond to named message queues. Every data pool can be linked to an individual data type specification in order to define admissible message contents. MIAMM The main objective of the MIAMM project is to develop new concepts and techniques in the field of multimodal interaction to allow fast and natural access</context>

Integration Our large projects have profited enormously of a dedicated integration group providing infrastructure, integration cycles and – for, e. g., the SmartKom and COMIC systems – a testbed (Herzog et al., 2004). Multimodality More modalities allow for more natural communication, which normally employs multiple channels of expression, suited to the content to be communicated. For natural language processing per se this raises new and interesting challenges, e. g., cross-modal referential expressions. It is also the case that more modalities constrain interpretation and hence enhance robustness. The ends-based representation allow for modalityindependent processing in the backbone. Standards Standards ease scalability. For, e. g., endsbased representations and tools, we have previously developed custo</context>

The action planner is the actual engine: using a regression planning approach the next system action is planned possibly preceeded by access of some external device. Finally, the presentation manager renders the system action. Here, the availability of different output modalities and the situation are influencing the realization of the action. Our architecture differs from that of (Blaylock et al., 2003) in that the responsibility of the next system action is in our case purely decided by the action planner; the approach has some similarities with the one taken in (Larsson, 2002) in that most communicative actions represent request-response interactions along goals (akin to QUDs), and there is a notion of information state, which is however kept separated between the discourse modeler (for information specific to dialogue content, roughly equivalent to the SHARED information in IBiS) and the action planner (for other information, such as the agenda of the dialogue engine). 3.1 Natural Language Understanding The task of the natural language understanding module is to transform the output of the speech recognizer into a list of possible user intentions which are already</context>

To devise the course of action, a plan is then constructed dynamically as a game sequence. This has the advantage that (1) the plan can be flexibly adapted to changed circumstances, e. g., if a step becomes obsolete or is addressed early, and (2) games can be shared and reused as building blocks for other applications. So, when new functionality is integrated, the plan knowledge source will stay reasonably small– growing linearly in the number of games, not exponentially with the possible recipes.3 3.4 Dis</context>

Furthermore, users can also combine several modalities to express one multimodal utterance (e. g., “I want to start here” accompanied by a pointing gesture towards a location on a map). As the recognizers and analyzers of the different modalities generate modality specific hypotheses, a component is needed to synchronize and integrate those monomodal hypotheses into multimodal ones. This module is called FUSION. Based on human-human communication research, e. g., (Oviatt, 1999), we can identify four basic interaction patterns of how to use different modalities within a single multimodal utterance: redundant the information provided by two modalities is basically the same, concurrent two modalities are used one after another to provide information, complementary the information provided by two modalities can be intertwined, contradicting the information provided by one modality is contradictory to the information provided by the other modality. All these interaction patterns can be resolved by obtaining access to information about the internal structure of objects. E</context>

In general, the resolution of referring expressions within a multimodal approach requires access to a visual context representation. One key aspect of DIM is a unified context representation taking both the discourse and the visual context into account. Our approach consists of a three-tiered discourse representation combined with a two layered focus handling, see (Pfleger et al., 2003). The actual processing is done by utilizing two operations: unification and overlay (Alexandersson and Becker, 2003). In combination with a scoring function (Pfleger et al., 2002), the latter is our main tool for enrichment and validation. Key to this approach is that DIM can be easily adapted to other dialogue systems with different tasks and demands. In that sense, the actual context representation is independent from the type of objects to be stored. Additionally, DIM can be used not only within a multimodal dialogue system but also within monomodal ones, as we showed in the NaRATo project. 3The usual downside is, the planning space is of course exponential. But as we use goal-directed search, only a small fraction of the possible plans is ever examined in practice.</context>

On the other hand, the templates are “fully specified” in the sense that they include intermediate layers of representation where possible to permit a later separation of rules into a multi-stage generation module. E.g., including syntax was also necessary for CTS, including semantics allows for the extraction of a realization module for COMIC. The template rules are based on the same PrePlan planning component used in fission. At least since (Reiter, 1995) the use of templates and “deep representations” is not seen as a contradiction. Picking up on this idea, the generation component in SmartKom is based on fully lexicalized generation (Becker, 1998), using partial derivation trees of a Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG). Right from the beginning of development, derivation trees which are seen as reflecting syntactic dependencies have been an explicitly represented layer in the template rules. Thus the higher level planning rules decide content selection, sentence plans and lexicalization, leaving syntactic realization to a TAG-based second step. Dur</context>

Using this toolbox we have implemented a number of systems, all having different requirements, needs and ends. They range from (monomodal) typed input/output as in the NaRATo project to multimodal agent-mediated communication as in SmartKom. Below we describe the different projects and systems showing that we are able to cover several kinds of communication paradigm. SmartKom SMARTKOM is a mixed-initiative dialogue system that provides full symmetric multimodality by combining speech, gesture, and facial expressions for both user input and system output (Wahlster, 2003). It provides an anthropomorphic and affective user interface through its personification of an embodied conversational agent, called Smartakus. The interaction metaphor is based on the so-called situated, delegation-oriented dialogue paradigm: the user delegates a task to a virtual communication assistant which is visualized as a life-like character. The interface agent recognizes the user’s intentions and goals, asks the user for feedback if necessary, accesses the various services on behalf of the user, and presents the results in an adequate manner. Non-verbal reactions of the users are ex</context>
