Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997551958333333">
Pedagogical materials frequently contain
deixis to communicative artifacts such as
textual structures (e.g., sections and lists),
discourse entities, and illustrations. By
relating such artifacts to the prose, deixis plays
an essential role in structuring the flow of
information in informative writing. However,
existing language technologies have largely
overlooked this mechanism. We examine
properties of deixis to communicative artifacts
using a corpus rich in determiner-established
instances of the phenomenon (e.g., “this
section”, “these equations”, “those reasons”)
from Wikibooks, a collection of learning texts.
We use this corpus in combination with
WordNet to determine a set of word senses
that are characteristic of the phenomenon,
showing its diversity and validating intuitions
about its qualities. The results motivate further
research to extract the connections encoded by
such deixis, with the goals of enhancing tools
to present pedagogical e-texts to readers and,
more broadly, improving language
technologies that rely on deictic phenomena.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997767333333333">
Deixis often appears in written language as an
anaphoric mechanism to refer to communicative
entities in a document. Such deixis can have a
variety of referent types. For example, consider
that idea in Sentence (1), those names in (2), this
section in (3), and these figures in (4):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99945375">
(1) That idea has been challenged by many.
(2) Those names are Welsh in origin.
(3) In this section, we cover some early work.
(4) Quantities in these figures are approximate.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954622222222">
The kinds of deixis represented in (1) and (2) are
similar to discourse deixis (Webber, 1991) and
textual deixis (Lyons, 1977), respectively.
Sentence (3) contains deixis to a structural
element of a document (Paraboni and Deemter,
2006), and (4) contains an example of deixis to
illustrative items such as figures or examples.
We collectively term such deictic acts as
communicative deixis (CD for brevity),
recognizing their shared characteristics, and we
name their referents communicative artifacts
(CAs). Prior studies have focused on narrow
varieties of CD (such as those identified above),
leaving unknown their properties when viewed
together as a whole. Moreover, efforts to
automatically identify or resolve CD have been
piecemeal at best. Given the complexity of the
referents, conventional tools for coreference or
anaphora resolution are poorly applicable.
This paper describes analysis of the first
collection of instances of deixis in English
targeted to refer to a broad variety of CAs. Texts
from the website Wikibooks are used, for the
intuitive density of CD in pedagogical material
and the potential value of augmenting them with
interpretive metadata. The diversity of referents
in this corpus enables new inferences on the
composition and relative frequencies of CD
varieties in text. We focus on determiner-
established instances, i.e., anaphoric noun
phrases that begin with determiners this, that,
these, or those (e.g., (1)-(4)). This focus has the
advantage of collecting instances that explicitly
identify the relevant capacities of their referents
(e.g., (1) reifies its referent as an “idea”).
The remainder of this paper is structured as
follows. Section 2 surveys related work on deixis
to specific types of CAs. Section 3 describes the
text source for this study and the procedure used
to collect and label instances. Section 4 describes
our use of WordNet to characterize CAs,
resulting in an ontology of such referents and
inter-annotator agreement results for labeling of
artifact types. Finally, Section 5 provides some
conclusions and directions for future work.

<bodyText confidence="0.99996879245283">
The value of CD in pedagogical contexts has
been established by studies such as those by
Mayer (2009) and Buisine and Martin (2007).
Those motivate our work to fill the present lack
of corpus-based linguistic knowledge of the
phenomenon. Also, although spatial deixis falls
beyond the scope of this paper, we acknowledge
the efforts of others such as Gergle et al. (2013)
to study its value in collaborative communication.
Prior works have examined discourse deixis in
text, though little attention has been given to CD
as a phenomenon or deixis to other CAs. Seminal
papers by Webber (1988, 1991) established the
importance of discourse deixis, although they
focused upon demonstrative pronouns such as
“this” or “that”. Many efforts have addressed
discourse deixis in the context of anaphora; these
include Poesio and Artstein’s (2008), who
created a corpus of anaphoric relations inclusive
of (but not limited to) discourse. Their collection
included 455 instances of discourse deixis,
although they noted ambiguity in the set of
markables. Dipper and Zinsmeister (2012) also
addressed discourse deixis through anaphora
resolution and produced a collection of 225
abstract anaphors out of 643 candidate instances.
Prior studies of shell nouns revealed capacities
of referents similar to a subset of those found in
our work. Such nouns are used anaphorically to
refer to complex, proposition-like pieces of
information such as points, assumptions, or acts
(Schmid, 2000). Kolhatkar et al. (2013) noted the
pervasiveness of shell nouns in text and their
tendency to “characterize and label” their
antecedents. However, such antecedents only
partly intersect with CAs. The set of shell nouns
studied by Schmid did not include typical
document entities such as section, figure, or list.
Simultaneously, the set included many nouns
with little or no relevance as CAs, such as fury,
miracle, and pride.
The task of identifying CD in text and referent
CAs bears some similarity to coreference
resolution. However, coreference resolvers tried
by the authors (namely CoreNLP (Recasens et al.,
2013), ArkRef (O’Connor and Heilman, 2013)
and the work of Roth and Bengston (2008)) were
ineffective at this task. We posit that many CAs
are not noun phrases, which makes them difficult
or inappropriate to characterize as referring
expressions. This limits the effectiveness of
traditional approaches to coreference resolution
toward the present problem.

Our results are further distinct from prior work
by focusing on the communicative capacities of a
variety of referents represented in documents.
However, the present focus upon determiner-
established phrases is more exclusive, and our
results do not include demarcation of referents.
We posit that the tradeoff is worthwhile, given
limited prior work on identifying CD and the
lack of prior efforts to study CAs other than
discourse entities.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999152">
Textbooks from Wikibooks were chosen to
supply pedagogical text. Among the alternatives,
this source provided the largest volume of
material with a license amenable to corpus
redistribution. Moreover, the collection of
English language textbooks on the site covers a
diverse set of topics and contains samples from a
variety of writers. Below we describe our text
pre-processing and then explain how candidate
instances of CD were identified.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999397">
3.1 Source Material
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988545454546">
To simplify collection and processing, 122
Wikibooks textbooks with printable versions
were selected for use. Contained in this set are
textbooks in eleven different subject areas, such
as computing, humanities, and the sciences. In
preparation for analysis, the documents were
POS tagged and parsed by the Stanford CoreNLP
suite (Socher et al., 2013; Toutanova et al.,
2003). Table 1 presents some statistics on the
texts in aggregate. They illustrate the substantial
size of most texts, though a few were freshly
started or incomplete. Overall, the corpus is
comparable in size with corpora from efforts
cited in Section 2, though text genera and sought
markables vary.
Next, potential instances of CD were
identified. Such instances were noun phrases
beginning with determiners this, that, these, or
those. We include these and those to collect CD
to sets of entities, a nuance absent from any
previous work. 9252 sentences, or 8% of the
corpus, contained at least one potential instance.

<bodyText confidence="0.9978106">
This collection contained substantial boilerplate
text, and sentences that appeared verbatim in at
least ten different books were discarded. This
filtering produced a set of 7613 candidate
instances. Table 2 shows the most frequent head
nouns in candidate instances. Some resemble the
shell nouns of prior work, but the presence of
others illustrates the diversity of CD. Diversity
was expected from pedagogical texts and
validates Wikibooks as a rich source of CD.
We conducted a preliminary survey of the
corpus contents by reading a random selection of
10% of candidates and judging their statuses as
instances of CA. Table 3 shows examples of
candidate instances, categorized by the foci of
prior studies (cited in the Introduction) of CD
phenomena. The researchers estimated that 48%
of candidates were instances of CD, although
directly labeling large numbers of candidates was
deemed impractical. Instead, we noted that the
word sense of the noun in a candidate instance is
an important (albeit not definitive) indication of
its CD status. Accordingly, we shift our focus
from individual candidate instances to words that
appear in them (i.e., lemmas) and word senses.

3.2 Word Senses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896304347826">
The noun in an instance of CD has a doubly
salient role in CA, by providing a cue to the
intended referent and also by reifying the
referent. For example, an illustrating referent
might be referred to as “this example” or “this
ideal”, with divergent consequences. The noun
choice semantically identifies the relevant
capacity of the referent, affecting its message.
To identify the varieties and characteristics of
CD in pedagogical text, we examine in aggregate
the senses of those words that appear in
candidate phrases in the corpus. WordNet 3.0
(Fellbaum, 1998) was chosen to provide an
ontological structure for relevant word senses
and thus for CAs. First, synsets for the 27 most
frequent nouns in candidate phrases were
collected, irrespective of viability for CD. This
covered 34% of candidate instances and resulted
in a set of 200 synsets. Their glosses were
labeled as viable or non-viable for CD by two
expert annotators, who first worked separately
and then collaborated to resolve differences in
their annotations.

Figure 1 shows the annotation instructions,
which were designed to address the combined
range of CAs from prior work. To illustrate its
application, consider the noun chapter. One gloss
of chapter is “a subdivision of a written work;
usually numbered and titled”. This sense clearly
satisfies the third numbered statement in Figure
1. Coherency arguments for the first and second
statements are less definitional, but both
annotators decided at least one was satisfactory,
leading to a y mark. Another gloss of chapter is
“any distinct period in history or in a person’s
life”. This sense fails to satisfy the second or
third statement, leading to an n mark.

Resolving differences between the annotators’
labels produced a set of 62 synsets whose glosses
characterized CAs. We refer to the sets of 200
synsets and 62 synsets as the CCS (candidates
for communicative senses) and VCS (verified
communicative senses) sets, respectively. We
offer the complete results of our annotations
online1 to encourage further research on this
topic. In this section we present inter-annotator
agreement statistics and describe the composition
of the VCS set using the structure of WordNet.

The kappa statistic for category agreement
between the two annotators was 0.70, with
matching annotations on 174 of 200 senses.
Although this metric is an imperfect indicator,
this value is generally regarded as substantial
(Viera and Garrett, 2005) albeit with some
tentativeness (Carletta, 1996). The annotators
respectively placed 33% and 30% of instances in
the VCS set, suggesting general agreement on
the distribution of labels irrespective of specific
instances. The annotators agreed that some cases
were difficult to label without context, and a
combination of sense labeling and in-text
instance labeling may be fruitful for future work.

reproduction of a subset of WordNet’s synsets
and relations, resulting in a de facto ontology of
CAs. The same procedure was performed for the
CCS set to create an illustrative baseline.
Table 4 shows the structure of the most
general synsets in the ontologies constructed
from VCS and CCS traces. Fractions illustrate
the relative constituent weight of each synset, by
virtue of the traces that include it. For example,
65 of the 72 traces for VCS synsets pass through
abstraction.n.06, and 37 of those 65 traces pass
through communication.n.02. The total quantities
of traces for CCS and VCS are greater than their
respective set sizes because of a small number of
synsets in those sets with multiple hyponym
paths to the root. The rightmost column of Table
4 shows the decimal result of subtracting the
CCS constituent weight fraction from the VCS
fraction. Positive numbers indicate that the
manual labeling of senses magnified the weight
of a synset over the CCS baseline.
The constituent weights confirm some
intuitions but also hold a few surprises. The vast
majority of CAs are abstractions rather than
physical entities, and most of the abstractions are
“something that is communicated by or to or
between people or groups” (the gloss of
communication.n.02). Psychological features are
also a substantial constituency, with traces to
VCS synsets that represent words such as
method, plan, and question. Most of the few
VCS physical entities are communicative
artifacts in their complete form (e.g., a book or a
periodical issue). Matter as a physical entity may
seem out of place in Table 4. The VCS synset
responsible for its inclusion is page.n.01, which
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995574">

<bodyText confidence="0.99999">
has the gloss “one side of one leaf (of a book or
magazine or newspaper or letter etc.) or the
written or pictorial matter it contains.” Both
annotators believed it merited inclusion in VCS.
Finally, we observed that many VCS senses
(58%) were not the first sense for their words,
indicating different senses appear more often2.
This likely hinders word sense disambiguation of
nouns in CD instances: the common baseline of
first sense tagging is futile in these cases, and
their extra-topical nature means that appropriate
CA senses are not implied by the surrounding
words (Wilson, 2011). This suggests that
identification of CD instances may require a
dedicated approach to word sense tagging.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965333333333">
The results of this study illustrate the
significance of CD, both for the processing of
pedagogical texts and for the broader project of
understanding anaphora. Its pervasiveness and its
diversity show its potential as a conduit for
language technologies to enrich documents with
pragmatic metadata. Our next effort will be to
identify the referents of CD instances using
knowledge from the present study of the
character and distribution of those referents. CAs
are represented by spans of content in a
document (e.g., text or figures), and accordingly
the identification of a CD referent will involve
the selection of the correct span of content. We
expect that the word sense of the noun in a CD
phrase will limit the set of potentially relevant
CAs, and that both localized features (such as
paragraph position of a CD instance and the
expected CA count) and document-level features
(e.g., proximity of potential referents) will be
valuable.

We examine properties of deixis to communicative artifacts using a corpus rich in determiner-established instances of the phenomenon (e.g., “this section”, “these equations”, “those reasons”) from Wikibooks, a collection of learning texts. We use this corpus in combination with WordNet to determine a set of word senses that are characteristic of the phenomenon, showing its diversity and validating intuitions about its qualities. The results motivate further research to extract the connections encoded by such deixis, with the goals of enhancing tools to present pedagogical e-texts to readers and, more broadly, improving language technologies that rely on deictic phenomena.</abstract>

For example, an illustrating referent might be referred to as “this example” or “this ideal”, with divergent consequences. The noun choice semantically identifies the relevant capacity of the referent, affecting its message. To identify the varieties and characteristics of CD in pedagogical text, we examine in aggregate the senses of those words that appear in candidate phrases in the corpus. WordNet 3.0 (Fellbaum, 1998) was chosen to provide an ontological structure for relevant word senses and thus for CAs. First, synsets for the 27 most frequent nouns in candidate phrases were collected, irrespective of viability for CD. This covered 34% of candidate instances and resulted in a set of 200 synsets. Their glosses were labeled as viable or non-viable for CD by two expert annotators, who first worked separately and then collaborated to resolve differences in their annotations. Examples Freq.

Overall, the corpus is comparable in size with corpora from efforts cited in Section 2, though text genera and sought markables vary. Next, potential instances of CD were identified.

Finally, we observed that many VCS senses (58%) were not the first sense for their words, indicating different senses appear more often2. This likely hinders word sense disambiguation of nouns in CD instances: the common baseline of first sense tagging is futile in these cases, and their extra-topical nature means that appropriate CA senses are not implied by the surrounding words (Wilson, 2011). This suggests that identification of CD instances may require a dedicated approach to word sense tagging. 5 Conclusion The results of this study illustrate the significance of CD, both for the processing of pedagogical texts and for the broader project of understanding anaphora. Its pervasiveness and its diversity show its potential as a conduit for language technologies to enrich documents with pragmatic metadata. Our next effort will be to identify the referents of CD instances using knowledge from the present study of the character and distribution of those referents. CAs are represented </context>
