This volume contains the full papers accepted for presentation at the BioLINK 2005 meeting.
This workshop represents the first joint Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)/Intelligent
Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) meeting. Each organization has held a workshop in this area
for the past three to four years; this is the first meeting sponsored jointly by the two parent organizations.
In bringing these two groups together, we have also melded two different traditions of distribution. The
ISMB tradition has been focussed on invited talks and “short papers” describing works in progress. The
ACL tradition has focussed on rigorously peer-reviewed full papers describing compeleted work. This
workshop features works in the three categories of “full paper,” “short paper,” and poster submissions.
Submissions in all three categories underwent an ACL-style peer review process.
Recent years have seen an interesting confluence between the worlds of bioinformatics and natural
language processing. Molecular biologists, confronted with new high-throughput sources of data, have
recognized that language processing can provide them with tools for handling a flood of data that is
unprecedented in the history of the life sciences. The natural language processing community, in turn,
has become aware of the resources that the computational bioscience community has made available,
and there has been growing interest in applying natural language processing techniques to mine the
biological literature to support complex applications in the biological domain, ranging from identifying
relevant literature, to extraction of experimental findings for the population of biological knowledge
bases, to summarization—all in order to present key facts to biologists in succinct form.
This workshop continued the interaction between these communities. We received a total of eighteen
full-paper submissions, from which eight were selected for presentation at the workshop and inclusion
in the ACL BioLINK workshop proceedings. An additional two of the full-paper submissions
were accepted as posters. Overall, eight of the full-paper submissions were concerned with entity
identification. Five of the eighteen dealt with information extraction. In addition, we received
submissions on the important topic of normalizing entity mentions.
BioLINK also solicited short-paper and poster submissions. Twenty-one short-paper submissions were
received, five of which were accepted for oral presentation. Four more were accepted for poster
presentation. All nine of these short papers are being distributed by ISMB as part of its SIG materials.
The meeting also featured a poster session.
