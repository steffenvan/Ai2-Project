Manually constructing a Wordnet is a dif-
ficult task, needing years of experts’ time.
As a first step to automatically construct
full Wordnets, we propose approaches to
generate Wordnet synsets for languages
both resource-rich and resource-poor, us-
ing publicly available Wordnets, a ma-
chine translator and/or a single bilin-
gual dictionary. Our algorithms translate
synsets of existing Wordnets to a target
language T, then apply a ranking method
on the translation candidates to find best
translations in T. Our approaches are ap-
plicable to any language which has at least
one existing bilingual dictionary translat-
ing from English to it.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999921016666667">
Wordnets are intricate and substantive reposito-
ries of lexical knowledge and have become im-
portant resources for computational processing of
natural languages and for information retrieval.
Good quality Wordnets are available only for a
few &amp;quot;resource-rich&amp;quot; languages such as English and
Japanese. Published approaches to automatically
build new Wordnets are manual or semi-automatic
and can be used only for languages that already
possess some lexical resources.
The Princeton Wordnet (PWN) (Fellbaum,
1998) was painstakingly constructed manually
over many decades. Wordnets, except the PWN,
have been usually constructed by one of two ap-
proaches. The first approach translates the PWN
to T (Bilgin et al., 2004), (Barbu and Mititelu,
2005), (Kaji and Watanabe, 2006), (Sagot and
Fišer, 2008), (Saveski and Trajkovsk, 2010) and
(Oliver and Climent, 2012); while the second ap-
proach builds a Wordnet in T, and then aligns
it with the PWN by generating translations (Gu-
nawan and Saputra, 2010). In terms of popular-
ity, the first approach dominates over the second
approach. Wordnets generated using the second
approach have different structures from the PWN;
however, the complex agglutinative morphology,
culture specific meanings and usages of words and
phrases of target languages can be maintained. In
contrast, Wordnets created using the first approach
have the same structure as the PWN.
One of our goals is to automatically gener-
ate high quality synsets, each of which is a set
of cognitive synonyms, for Wordnets having the
same structure as the PWN in several languages.
Therefore, we use the first approach to construct
Wordnets. This paper discusses the first step of a
project to automatically build core Wordnets for
languages with low amounts of resources (viz.,
Arabic and Vietnamese), resource-poor languages
(viz., Assamese) or endangered languages (viz.,
Dimasa and Karbi)1. The sizes and the qualities
of freely existing resources, if any, for these lan-
guages vary, but are not usually high. Hence, our
second goal is to use a limited number of freely
available resources in the target languages as in-
put to our algorithms to ensure that our methods
can be felicitously used with languages that lack
much resource. In addition, our approaches need
to have a capability to reduce noise coming from
the existing resources that we use. For transla-
tion, we use a free machine translator (MT) and
restrict ourselves to using it as the only &amp;quot;dictio-
nary&amp;quot; we can have. For research purposes, we have
obtained free access to the Microsoft Translator,
which supports translations among 44 languages.
In particular, given public Wordnets aligned to the
PWN ( such as the FinnWordNet (FWN) (Lindén,
2010) and the JapaneseWordNet (JWN) (Isahara et
al., 2008) ) and the Microsoft Translator, we build
Wordnet synsets for arb, asm, dis, ajz and vie.

2 Proposed approaches
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977470588235">
In this section, we propose approaches to create
Wordnet synsets for a target languages T using ex-
isting Wordnets and the MT and/or a single bilin-
gual dictionary. We take advantage of the fact
that every synset in PWN has a unique offset-POS,
referring to the offset for a synset with a partic-
ular part-of-speech (POS) from the beginning of
its data file. Each synset may have one or more
words, each of which may be in one or more
synsets. Words in a synset have the same sense.
The basic idea is to extract corresponding synsets
for each offset-POS from existing Wordnets linked
to PWN, in several languages. Next, we translate
extracted synsets in each language to T to produce
so-called synset candidates using MT. Then, we
apply a ranking method on these candidates to find
the correct words for a specific offset-POS in T.

2.1 Generating synset candidates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999">
We propose three approaches to generate synset
candidates for each offset-POS in T.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.501155">
2.1.1 The direct translation (DR) approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9528285">
The first approach directly translates synsets in
PWN to T as in Figure 1.

2.1.3 Approach using intermediate Wordnets
and a dictionary (IWND)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974083333333">
The IW approach for creating Wordnet synsets de-
creases ambiguities in translations. However, we
need more than one bilingual dictionary from each
intermediate languages to T. Such dictionaries are
not always available for many languages, espe-
cially the ones that are resource poor. The IWND
approach is like the IW approach, but instead of
translating immediately from the intermediate lan-
guages to the target language, we translate synsets
extracted from intermediate Wordnets to English
(eng), then translate them to the target language.
The IWND approach is presented in Figure 3.

<bodyText confidence="0.958194333333333">
For each offset-POS, we extract words in that
synset from the PWN and translate them to the tar-
get language to generate translation candidates.
2.1.2 Approach using intermediate Wordnets
(IW)
To handle ambiguities in synset translation, we
propose the IW approach as in Figure 2. Publicly
available Wordnets in various languages, which
we call intermediate Wordnets, are used as re-
sources to create synsets for Wordnets. For each
offset-POS, we extract its corresponding synsets
from intermediate Wordnets. Then, the extracted
synsets, which are in different languages, are
translated to T using MT to generate synset candi-
dates. Depending on which Wordnets are used and
the number of intermediate Wordnets, the num-
ber of candidates in each synset and the number
of synsets in the new Wordnets change.

2.2 Ranking method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99953775">
For each of offset-POS, we have many translation
candidates. A translation candidate with a higher
rank is more likely to become a word belonging to
the corresponding offset-POS of the new Wordnet
in the target language. Candidates having the same
ranks are treated similarly. The rank value in the
range 0.00 to 1.00. The rank of a word w, the so-
called rank,,,, is computed as below.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9176715">
rank = occurw ∗ numDstWordnets
w numCandidates numWordnets
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994706258064516">
where:
- numCandidates is the total number of trans-
lation candidates of an offset-POS
- occur,,, is the occurrence count of the word w
in the numCandidates
- numWordnets is the number of intermediate
Wordnets used, and
- numDstWordnets is the number of distinct in-
termediate Wordnets that have words trans-
lated to the word w in the target language.
Our motivation for this rank formula is the fol-
lowing. If a candidate has a higher occurrence
count, it has a greater chance to become a cor-
rect translation. Therefore, the occurrence count
of each candidate needs to be taken into account.
We normalize the occurrence count of a word by
dividing it by numCandidates. In addition, if a
candidate is translated from different words hav-
ing the same sense in different languages, this can-
didate is more likely to be a correct translation.
Hence, we multiply the first fraction by numDst-
Wordnets. To normalize, we divide results by the
number of intermediate Wordnet used.
For instance, in our experiments we use 4 in-
termediate Wordnets, viz., PWN, FWN, JWN and
WOLF Wordnet (WWN) (Sagot and Fišer, 2008).
The words in the offset-POS &amp;quot;00006802-v&amp;quot; ob-
tained from all 4 Wordnets, their translations to
arb, the occurrence count and the rank of each
translation are presented in the second, the fourth
and the fifth columns, respectively, of Figure 4.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999532">
2.3 Selecting candidates based on ranks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9933985">
We separate candidates based on three cases as be-
low.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.7703090625">
Case 1: A candidate w has the highest chance
to become a correct word belonging to a specific
synset in the target language if its rank is 1.0. This
means that all intermediate Wordnets contain the
synset having a specific offset-POS and all words
belonging to these synsets are translated to the
Figure 4: Example of calculating the ranks of
candidates translated from words belonging to the
offset-POS &amp;quot;00006802-v&amp;quot; in 4 Wordnets: PWN,
FWN, JWN and WWN. The wordA, wordB and
wordC are obtained from PWN, FWN and WWN,
respectively. The JWN does not contain this offset-
POS. TL presents transliterations of the words in
arb. The numWordnets is 4 and the numCandi-
dates is 7. The rank of each candidate is shown in
the last column of Figure 4.

same word w. The more the number of intermedi-
ate Wordnets used, the higher the chance the can-
didate with the rank of 1.0 has to become the cor-
rect translation. Therefore, we accept all transla-
tions that satisfy this criterion. An example of this
scenario is presented in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Example of Case 1: Using the IW ap-
proach with four intermediate Wordnets, PWN,
FWN, JWN and WWN. All words belonging to
the offSet-POS &amp;quot;00952615-n&amp;quot; in all 4 Wordnets are
translated to the same word &amp;quot;đien&amp;quot; in vie. The
word &amp;quot;đien&amp;quot; is accepted as the correct word be-
longing to the offSet-POS &amp;quot;00952615-n&amp;quot; in the
Vietnamese Wordnet we create.
Case 2: If an offSet-POS does not have candi-
dates having the rank of 1.0, we accept the candi-
dates having the greatest rank. Figure 6 shows the
example of the second scenario.

The PWN is the oldest and the biggest available
Wordnet. It is also free. Wordnets in many
languages are being constructed and developed2.
However, only a few of these Wordnets are of high
quality and free for downloading. The EuroWord-
net (Vossen, 1998) is a multilingual database with
Wordnets in European languages (e.g., Dutch, Ital-
ian and Spanish). The AsianWordnet3 provides
a platform for building and sharing Wordnets for
Asian languages (e.g., Mongolian, Thai and Viet-
namese). Unfortunately, the progress in building
most of these Wordnets is slow and they are far
from being finished.

Evaluations were performed by volunteers who
use the language of the Wordnet as mother tongue.
To achieve reliable judgment, we use the same
set of 500 offSet-POSs, randomly chosen from the
synsets we create. Each volunteer was requested
to evaluate using a 5-point scale – 5: excellent, 4:
good, 3: average, 2: fair and 1: bad. The aver-
age score of Wordnet synsets for arb, asm and vie
are 3.82, 3.78 and 3.75, respectively. We notice
that the Wordnet synsets generated using the IW
approach with all 4 intermediate Wordnets have
the highest average score: 4.16/5.00 for arb and
4.26/5.00 for vie. We are in the process of finding
volunteers to evaluate the Wordnet synsets for ajz
and dis.
It is difficult to compare Wordnets because the
languages involved in different papers are differ-
ent, the number and quality of input resources vary
and the evaluation methods are not standard. How-
ever, for the sake of completeness, we make an at-
tempt at comparing our results with published pa-
pers. Although our score is not in terms of percent-
age, we obtain the average score of 3.78/5.00 (or
informally and possibly incorrectly, 75.60% preci-
sion) which we believe it is better than 55.30% ob-
tained by (Bond et al., 2008) and 43.20% obtained
by (Charoenporn et al., 2008). In addition, the av-
erage coverage percentage of all Wordnet synsets
we create is 44.85% which is better than 12% in
(Charoenporn et al., 2008) and 33276 synsets (^
28.28%) in (Saveski and Trajkovsk, 2010) .
The previous studies need more than one dic-
tionary to translate between a target language
and intermediate-helper languages. For exam-
ple, to create the JWN, (Bond et al., 2008) needs
the Japanese-Multilingual dictionary, Japanese-
English lexicon and Japanese-English life sci-
ence dictionary. For asm, there are a number
of Dict(eng,asm); to the best of our knowledge
only two online dictionaries, both between eng
and asm, are available. The IWND approach re-
quires only one input dictionary between a pair of
languages. This is a strength of our method.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965833333333">
We present approaches to create Wordnet synsets
for languages using available Wordnets, a public
MT and a single bilingual dictionary. We create
Wordnet synsets with good accuracy and high cov-
erage for languages with low resources (arb and
vie), resource-poor (asm) and endangered (ajz and
dis). We believe that our work has the potential
to construct full Wordnets for languages which do
not have many existing resources. We are in the
process of creating a Website where all Wordnet
synsets we create will be available, along with a
user friendly interface to give feedback on individ-
ual entries. We will solicit feedback from commu-
nities that use these languages as mother-tongue.
Our goal is to use this feedback to improve the
quality of the Wordnet synsets. Some of Word-
net synsets we created can be downloaded from

<abstract confidence="0.996157882352941">Manually constructing a Wordnet is a difficult task, needing years of experts’ time. As a first step to automatically construct full Wordnets, we propose approaches to generate Wordnet synsets for languages both resource-rich and resource-poor, using publicly available Wordnets, a machine translator and/or a single bilingual dictionary. Our algorithms translate synsets of existing Wordnets to a target then apply a ranking method on the translation candidates to find best in Our approaches are applicable to any language which has at least one existing bilingual dictionary translating from English to it.</abstract>

Therefore, the occurrence count of each candidate needs to be taken into account. We normalize the occurrence count of a word by dividing it by numCandidates. In addition, if a candidate is translated from different words having the same sense in different languages, this candidate is more likely to be a correct translation. Hence, we multiply the first fraction by numDstWordnets. To normalize, we divide results by the number of intermediate Wordnet used. For instance, in our experiments we use 4 intermediate Wordnets, viz., PWN, FWN, JWN and WOLF Wordnet (WWN) (Sagot and Fišer, 2008). The words in the offset-POS &amp;quot;00006802-v&amp;quot; obtained from all 4 Wordnets, their translations to arb, the occurrence count and the rank of each translation are presented in the second, the fourth and the fifth columns, respectively, of Figure 4. 2.3 Selecting candidates based on ranks We separate candidates based on three cases as below.

However, for the sake of completeness, we make an attempt at comparing our results with published papers. Although our score is not in terms of percentage, we obtain the average score of 3.78/5.00 (or informally and possibly incorrectly, 75.60% precision) which we believe it is better than 55.30% obtained by (Bond et al., 2008) and 43.20% obtained by (Charoenporn et al., 2008). In addition, the average coverage percentage of all Wordnet synsets we create is 44.85% which is better than 12% in (Charoenporn et al., 2008) and 33276 synsets (^ 28.28%) in (Saveski and Trajkovsk, 2010) . The previous studies need more than one dictionary to translate between a target language and intermediate-helper languages. For example, to create the JWN, (Bond et al., 2008) needs the Japanese-Multilingual dictionary, JapaneseEnglish lexicon and Japanese-English life science dictionary. For asm, there are a number of Dict(eng,asm); to the best of our knowledge only two online dictionaries, both between eng and asm, are available. The IWND approach requires only one input dictionary between a pair of languages. This is a strength of our method. 4 Conclusion and future work We present appr</context>
