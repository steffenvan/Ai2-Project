<bodyText confidence="0.999863722222222">
This paper investigates three multilingual
named entity corpora, including named
people, named locations and named
organizations. Frequency-based
approaches with and without dictionary
are proposed to extract formulation rules
of named entities for individual languages,
and transformation rules for mapping
among languages. We consider the issues
of abbreviation and compound keyword at
a distance. Keywords specify not only the
types of named entities, but also tell out
which parts of a named entity should be
meaning-translated and which part should
be phoneme-transliterated. An
application of the results on cross
language information retrieval is also
shown.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999669622222222">
Named entities are major components of a
document. Capturing named entities is a
fundamental task to understanding documents
(MUC, 1998). Several approaches have been
proposed to recognize these types of terms. For
example, corpus-based methods are employed to
extract Chinese personal names, and rule-based
methods are used to extract Chinese date/time
expressions and monetary and percentage
expressions (Chen and Lee, 1996; Chen, Ding and
Tsai, 1998). In the past, named entity extraction
mainly focuses on general domains and is
employed to various applications such as
information retrieval (Chen, Ding and Tsai, 1998),
question-answering (Lin, et al., 2001), and so on.
Recently, several attempts have been extended to
mine knowledge from biomedical documents
(Hirschman, et al., 2002).
Most of the previous approaches dealt with
monolingual named entity extraction. Chen et al.
(1998) extended it to cross-language information
retrieval. A grapheme-based model was proposed
to compute the similarity between Chinese
transliteration name and English name. Lin and
Chen (2000) further classified the works into two
directions – say, forward transliteration (Wan and
Verspoor, 1998) and backward transliteration
(Chen et al., 1998; Knight and Graehl, 1998), and
proposed a phoneme-based model. Lin and Chen
(2002) employed a machine learning approach to
determine phonetic similarity scores for machine
transliteration. AI-Onaizan and Knight (2002)
investigated the translation of Arabic named
entities to English using monolingual and bilingual
resources.
The past works on multilingual named entities
emphasizes on the transliteration issues. However,
the transformation between named entities in
different languages is not transliteration only. The
mapping may be a combination of meaning
translation and/or phoneme transliteration. The
following five English-Chinese examples show
this issue. The symbol A ⇔ B denotes a foreign
name A is translated and/or transliterated into a
Chinese name B.

Example (s1) shows a name part (i.e., Victoria)
and a keyword part (i.e., Fall) of a named location
are transliterated and translated into “維多利亞”
(wei duo li ya) and “瀑布” (pu bu), respectively.
In Example (s2), the keyword part (i.e., Mountains)
is still translated, i.e., “山脈” (shan mo), however,
some part of name is translated (i.e., Little ⇔ “小”
(xiao)) and another part is transliterated (i.e.,
Rocky ⇔ “落磯” (luo ji)). Example (s3) shows an
extreme case. All the three words are translated
(i.e., Great ⇔ “大” (da)), Salt ⇔ “鹽” (yan), Lake
⇔ “湖” (hu)). Examples (s4) and (s5) show two
location names without keywords. The former is
transliterated and the latter is a combination of
transliteration and translation.
Which part is translated and which part is
transliterated depends on the type of named entities.
For example, personal names tend to be
transliterated. For a location name, name part and
keyword part are usually transliterated and
translated, respectively. The organization names
are totally different. Most of constituents are
translated. Besides the issue of the named entity
types, different language pairs have different
transformation rules. German named entity has
decompounding problem when it is
translated/transliterated, e.g., Bundesbahn ⇔ “聯
邦鐵路局” (lian bang tie lu ju) and Bundesbank ⇔
“聯邦銀行” (lian bang yin hang).
This paper will study the issues of languages
and named entity types on the choices of
translation and transliteration. We focus on three
more challenging named entities only, i.e., named
people, named locations and named organizations.
Three phrase-aligned corpora will be adopted – say,
a multilingual personal name corpus and a
multilingual organization name corpus compiled
by Central News Agency (abbreviated CNA
personal name and organization corpora hereafter),
and a multilingual location name corpus compiled
by National Institute for Compilation and
Translation of Taiwan (abbreviated NICT location
name corpus hereafter). We will extract
transliteration/translation rules from these
multilingual named corpora. This paper is
organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the
corpora used. Section 3 shows how to extract
formulation rules and the transformation rules.
Section 4 analyzes the results. Section 5
demonstrates the application of the extracted rules
on cross language information retrieval. Section 6
concludes the remarks.

NICT location name corpus which was developed
by Ministry of Education of Taiwan in 1995
collected 19,385 foreign location names. Each
entry consists of three parts, including foreign
location name, Chinese transliteration/translation
name, and country name, e.g., (Victoria Fall, “維
多利亞瀑布” (wei duo li ya pu bu), South Africa),
(Little Rocky Mountains, “小落磯山脈” (xiao luo
ji shan mo), USA), etc. The foreign location
names are in English alphabet. Some location
names denoting the same city have more than one
form like Firenze and Florence for a famous Italian
city. The former is an Italian name and the latter is
its English name. They correspond to two
different transliterations in Chinese, respectively,
i.e., “翡冷翠” (fei leng cui) and “佛羅倫斯” (fo
luo lun si). The pronunciation of the foreign
names in NICT corpus is based on Webster’s New
Geographic Dictionary. The foreign name itself
may be a transliteration name. A Japanese city is
transliterated in English alphabet, but its
corresponding translation name is in Kanji (Hanzi
in Japanese). It is hard to capture their
relationships except dictionary lookup, so that
Japanese location name is out of our discussion.
We employ the country field to select the
translation/transliteration pairs that we will deal
with in this paper. Table 1 summarizes the
statistics of NICT corpus based on country tags.

CNA personal name and organization corpora
are used by news reporters to unify the name
transliteration/translation in news stories. There
are 50,586 pairs of foreign personal names and
Chinese transliteration/translation in persona name
corpus. Different from NICT corpus, there do not
exist clear cues to identify the nationality of named
people. Thus, we could not exclude the Japanese
names like “Hayakawa” and the corresponding
name “* Al ” (zao chuan) from our discussion
automatically. There are 14,658 named
organizations in CNA corpus. Some organization
names are tagged with the country names to which
they belong. For example, “Aachen Technical
University” ⇔ ; *A_ (ya ken ji shu da
xue) (Germany). But not all the organization
names have such country tags. Comparatively,
organization names are longer than the other two
named entities. Table 2 shows the statistics of
NICT organization name corpus. FL denotes the
length of foreign names in words, CL denotes the
length of Chinese names in characters, and Count

3.1 Frequency-Based Approach with a

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999355230769231">
We postulate that a transliterated term is usually an
unknown word, i.e., not listed in a lexicon and a
translated term often appears in a lexicon. Under
this postulation, a translated term occurs more
often in a corpus, and comparatively, a
transliterated term only appears very few.
A simple frequency-based method will
compute the frequencies of terms and use them to
tell out the transliteration and translation parts in a
named entity. Because Chinese has segmentation
problem, we start the frequency computation from
the foreign name part in a multilingual named
entity corpus. The method is sketched as follows.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999734571428571">
(1) Compute the word frequencies of each
word in the foreign name list.
(2) Keep those words that appear more than a
threshold and appear in a common foreign
dictionary (e.g., an English dictionary). These
words form candidates of simple keywords.
(3) Examine the foreign word list again.

<bodyText confidence="0.998961357142858">
Those word strings that are composed of simple
keyword candidates are candidates of compound
keywords. We find out the compound keyword set
by using collocation metric by selecting the most
frequently occurring compounds through the well-
known elimination of prepositions.
(4)Because the experimental corpus is aligned,
we can cluster the Chinese name list based on
foreign keywords. For each Chinese name cluster,
we try to identify the Chinese keyword sets. Here
a bilingual dictionary may be consulted.
The above algorithm extracts foreign/Chinese
keyword sets from a multilingual named entity
corpus. In the meantime, formulation rules for
foreign names and Chinese counterparts are mined.
A complete foreign name and a complete Chinese
name are mapped into name-keyword combination.
By the way, which method, translation or
transliteration, is used is also determined.
Take NICT location name corpus as an
example. The terms of frequencies greater than 20
include River (;7, he), Island (R7, dao), Lake (AA,
hu), Mountain (Ja, shan), Bay (X, wan), Mountain
(, feng), Peak (, feng), Islands (j*R7, qun dao),
Mountains (JaVic, shan mo), Cape (A, jiao), City
(JA, cheng), Range (&amp; ling), Peninsula (+R7, ban
dao), Point (A, jiao), Strait (;#, hai xia), River
(Al, chuan), Gulf (X, wan), Cape (JT, jia), Pass
( Ja a , shan kou), Plateau ( n R, , gao yuan),
Headland (JT, jia), Harbor (*, gang), Sea (;#, hai),
Promontory (JT, jia), and Hills (Si.►, qui ling).
On the one hand, a foreign location keyword, e.g.,
“Mountain”, may correspond to two Chinese
location keywords, e.g., “Ja” (shan) and “�”
(feng). On the other hand, the same Chinese
location keyword “�” (feng) can be translated into
two English location keywords “Mountain” and
“Peak”.
Similarly, suffix and prefix for organization
names can be extracted from CNA organization
name corpus. Some high frequent keywords are
shown as follows.

3.2 Keyword Extraction without a Bilingual
Dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999482222222222">
At the step (4) of the algorithm in Section 3.1, a
bilingual dictionary is required. Because
abbreviation is common adopted in translation,
dictionary-based approach is hard to capture this
phenomenon. A named organization “World
Taiwanese Association” which is translated into
“世台會” (shi tai hui) is a typical example. The
term “World” is translated into an abbreviated term
“世” (shi) rather than a complete term “世界” (shi
jie). Here another approach without dictionary is
proposed. Suppose there are M pairs of (foreign
name, Chinese name) in a multilingual named
entity corpus. The jth pair, 1 ≤ j ≤ M, is denoted by
{Ej, Cj}, where Ej is a foreign named entity, and Cj
is a Chinese named entity. Then some Chinese
segment c e Cj should be associated with some
foreign segment e e Ej. Consider the following
examples.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99811875">
(s6) Aletschhorn Mountain a 阿利奇赫恩山
(s7) Catalan Mountain a 卡太蘭山
(s8) Cook Strait a 科克海峽
(s9) Dover, Strait of a多佛海峽
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999645419354839">
We will align “山” (shan) and “海峽” (hai xia) to
Mountain and Strait, respectively, from these
examples.
We further decompose the named entities. If
a named entity Ej comprises m words w1·w2...wm,
then a candidate segment ep, q is defined as wp ... wq,
where 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ m. If a Chinese named entity Cj
has n syllables s1·s2...sn, then a candidate segment
cx, y is defined as sx ... sy, where 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ n.
{ep, q, cx, y} from {Ej, Cj}. We then group the pairs
collected from the multilingual named entity list
and count the frequency for each occurrence.
Those pairs with higher frequency denote
significant segment pairs. In the above examples,
both the two pairs {Mountain, “山” (shan)} and
{Strait, “海峽” (hai xia)} appear twice, while the
other pairs appear only once.
All the pairs {e, c} whose frequency &gt; 2 are
kept. Two issues have to be addressed. The first is:
redundancy which may exist in the pairs of
segments should be eliminated carefully. If a pair
{e, s1 s2 ... st} occurs k times, then the frequency
of tx(t+1)/2 substrings (1 ≤ u ≤ v ≤ t) is at least k.
The second is: e may be translated to more than
one synonym, which has the same prefix, suffix, or
infix. In examples (s10) and (s11), “Association”
may be translated into “協會” (xie hui) and “聯誼
會” (lian yi hui), where “會” (hui) is a common
suffix of these two translation equivalents, so that
its frequency is more than the translation
equivalents.

These two issues may be mixed together to make
this problem more challengeable.
A metric to deal with the above issues is
proposed. The concept is borrowed from tfxidf
scheme in information retrieval to measure the
alignment of each foreign segment and the possible
Chinese translation segments. Assume there are N
foreign segments. Term frequency (tf) of a
Chinese translation segment ci in e denotes the
number of occurrences of ci in e. Document
frequency (df) of ci is the number of foreign
segments that ci is translated to. We prefer to the
Chinese translation segment that occur frequently
in a specific foreign segment, but rarely in the
remainder of foreign segments. Besides, we also
prefer the longer Chinese segment, so that the
length of a Chinese segment, i.e., |ci|, is also
considered.

In this way, we can produce a ranking list of pairs

form multilingual keyword pairs.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999834">
3.3 Extraction of Transformation Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994666666667">
We apply the keyword pairs extracted in the last
section to the original named entity list. In (s6)-
(s9), (mountain, 山 (shan)) and (strait, 海峽 (hai
xia)) are significant keyword pairs. We replace the
non-keywords of Ej and Cj with patterns y and 6,
respectively, get the following rules.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.97406125">
(s6’) y mountain ⇔ 6 山

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998069111111111">
(s6’) and (s7’) can be grouped into a rule. As a
result, a set of transformation rules can be
formulated. From these examples, Chinese
location name keyword tends to be located in the
rightmost and the remaining part is a transliterated
name. On the counterpart, foreign location name
keyword tends to be either located in the rightmost,
or permuted by some prepositions, comma, and the
transliterating part.

3.4 Extraction of Keywords at a Distance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999801">
The algorithm proposed in Section 3.2 can deal
with single keywords and connected compound
keywords. Now we will extend it to keywords at a
distance. Consider examples (s12)-(s15) at first.

<listItem confidence="0.997981375">

<bodyText confidence="0.996887916666667">
(s12) and (s13) show that an English compound
keyword is separated and so is its corresponding
Chinese counterpart. In contrast, the English
compound keyword is connected in (s14) and (s15),
but the corresponding Chinese translation is
separated. The phenomenon appears quite often in
the translation of organization names.
We introduce a symbol ∆ to cope with the
distance issue. The original algorithm is modified
as follows. A candidate segment cp, 4 is defined as
a string that begins with sp and ends with sq. Each
syllable from sp_1 to sq_1 can be replaced by ∆.
Therefore, both ep, 4 and cx, y are extended to 2(p-q-1),
and 2(x-y-1) instances, respectively. For example,
the following shows some additional instances for
“American Civil Liberties Union”.
“American ∆ Liberties Union”
“American Civil ∆ Union”
“American ∆ Union”
The scoring method, i.e., formulas (1)-(4), is still
applicable for the new algorithm. Nevertheless,
the complexity is different. The complexity of the
original algorithm is O(m2n2), but the complexity
of the algorithm here is O(2m2n), where m is the
word count for a foreign named entity and n is the
character count for a Chinese named entity.
The mining procedure is performed only
once, and the mined rules are employed in an
application without being recomputed. Thus, the
running time is not the major concern of this paper.
Besides, the N is bounded in a reasonable small
number because the length of a named entity is
always rather shorter than that of a sentence. Table
2 shows that 93.88% of foreign names in CNA
organization name corpus consist of less than 7
words.

to the 5,714 named locations, we can tell out which
part is transliterated and which part is translated
from 4,262 named locations. It confirms our
postulation that a named location is composed of
two parts, i.e., one is translated and the other one is
transliterated.
Comparatively, there are 50,586 personal
names in CNA personal names, but only 100
named people are composed of more than one
word. The number of keywords extracted is only a
few. They are listed below.
De ⇔ Jk (dai), La ⇔ 4k (la), De La ⇔ Jk4k
(dai la), Van Der ⇔ &gt;e*— (fan de), Du ⇔ +L (du),
David ⇔ ), T (da wei), Khan ⇔ ;t (han), Del ⇔
Jk (dai), Le ⇔ *h (le), Van Den ⇔ &gt;e� (fan
deng), Di ⇔ i*— (di)
It shows that personal names tend to be
transliterated and the CNA personal name corpus
is suitable for training the similarity scores among
phonetic characters (Lin and Chen, 2002).
Finally, we consider the named organizations.
There are 14,658 records in CNA organization
corpus. Total 12,885 organization names are
composed of more than one word. The percentage,
87.90%, is the highest among these three corpora.
Besides that, 5,229 keyword pairs are extracted.
Most of the keyword pairs are meaning translated.
This set is also the largest among the three corpora.
Thus, the keyword pairs are too small and too large
to find suitable transformation rules for personal
names and organization names, respectively.
Although the original idea of our algorithm is
universal for languages, it should be modified
slightly for some specific languages. The
following takes German as examples. German
words have cases and genders. Most of German
words are compound. Consider examples (s16)-
(s19).

<bodyText confidence="0.999836">
The first two examples show the German adjective
Neu (New) has different suffixes such as “-e” and
“-es” according to the case and gender of the noun.
The last two examples suggest that morphological
analysis for decompounding the words into
meaningful segments is necessary before our
algorithm.

5 Application on CLIR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904692307692">
Cross language information retrieval (CLIR)
facilitates using queries in one language to access
documents in another. Because named entities are
key components of a document, they are usually
targets that users are interested in. Figure 1 shows
an application of the extracted formulation rules
and transformation rules on Chinese-Foreign CLIR.
For each document in the Foreign collection,
named entities are recognized and classified by
using formulation rules. They form important
indices for the related documents. When a Chinese
query is issued, the system extracts the possible
Chinese named entities according to Chinese
formulation rules. If keywords are specified in a
query, we know the structure and the type of the
named entity. The lexical structure tells us which
part is translated and which part is transliterated.
The backward transliteration method proposed
by Lin and Chen (2000, 2002) was followed to
select the most similar English named entity and
the related documents at the same time. In Lin and
Chen’s approach, both Chinese name and English
candidates will be transformed into a canonical
form in terms of International Phonetic Alphabets.
Similarity computation among Chinese query term
and English candidates are done on phoneme level.

6 Conclusion and Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998309375">
This paper proposes corpus-based approaches to
extract the formulation rules and the translation/
transliteration rules among multilingual named
entities. Simple frequency-based method identifies
keywords of named entities for individual
languages and their correspondence. The modified
tf×idf scheme deals with the issues of abbreviation
and compound keyword at a distance.
Since the corpora are already phrase-aligned,
the mined rules cover at least a significant number
of instances. That is, they seem to be significant,
but further evaluation is needed. Two types of
evaluation are being conducted, i.e., direct and
indirect approaches. In the former, we will
partition the corpora into two parts, one for
training and the other one for testing. In the latter,
we are integrating our method in a cross language
information retrieval system. Given a query
consisting of Chinese named entity, the Chinese
formulation rules will tell us its type and lexical
structures. The transformation rules show which
parts should be translated and transliterated. Our
previous works on phoneme transliteration is
integrated. The transformation result may be
submitted to an information retrieval system to
access documents in another language. In the
ongoing evaluation, the test bed is supported by
CLEF (2003). The result will be reported in
CLEF2003 after evaluation by CLEF organizer.
Further applications will be explored in the future
and the methodology will be extended to other
types of named entities.

Recently, several attempts have been extended to mine knowledge from biomedical documents (Hirschman, et al., 2002). Most of the previous approaches dealt with monolingual named entity extraction. Chen et al. (1998) extended it to cross-language information retrieval. A grapheme-based model was proposed to compute the similarity between Chinese transliteration name and English name. Lin and Chen (2000) further classified the works into two directions – say, forward transliteration (Wan and Verspoor, 1998) and backward transliteration (Chen et al., 1998; Knight and Graehl, 1998), and proposed a phoneme-based model. Lin and Chen (2002) employed a machine learning approach to determine phonetic similarity scores for machine transliteration. AI-Onaizan and Knight (2002) investigated the translation of Arabic named entities to English using monolingual and bilingual resources. The past works on multilingual named entities emphasizes on the transliteration issues. However, the transformation between named entities in different languages is not transliteration only. The mapping may be a combination o</context>
