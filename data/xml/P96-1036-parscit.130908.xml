Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99971875">
Based on empirical evidence from a free
word order language (German) we propose a
fundamental revision of the principles guid-
ing the ordering of discourse entities in the
forward-looking centers within the center-
ing model. We claim that grammatical role
criteria should be replaced by indicators
of the functional information structure of
the utterances, i.e., the distinction between
context-bound and unbound discourse ele-
ments. This claim is backed up by an empir-
ical evaluation of functional centering.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998562142857143">
The centering model has evolved as a methodology for
the description and explanation of the local coherence
of discourse (Grosz et al., 1983; 1995), with focus on
pronominal and nominal anaphora. Though several
cross-linguistic studies have been carried out (cf. the
enumeration in Grosz et al. (1995)), an almost canon-
ical scheme for the ordering on the forward-looking
centers has emerged, one that reflects well-known reg-
ularities of fixed word order languages such as En-
glish. With the exception of Walker et al. (1990;
1994) for Japanese, Turan (1995) for Turkish, Ram-
bow (1993) for German and Cote (1996) for English,
only grammatical roles are considered and the (par-
tial) ordering in Table 1&apos; is taken for granted.

<bodyText confidence="0.999035787234043">
&apos;Table 1 contains the most explicit ordering of grammat-
ical roles we are aware of and has been taken from Bren-
nan et al. (1987). Often, the distinction between comple-
ments and adjuncts is collapsed into the category &amp;quot;others&amp;quot;
(c.f., e.g., Grosz et al. (1995)).
Our work on the resolution of anaphora (Strube &amp;
Hahn, 1995; Hahn &amp; Strube, 1996) and textual el-
lipsis (Hahn et al., 1996), however, is based on Ger-
man, a free word order language, in which grammat-
ical role information is far less predictive for the or-
ganization of centers. Rather, for establishing proper
referential relations, the functional information struc-
ture of the utterances becomes crucial (different per-
spectives on functional analysis are brought forward
in Dant (1974b) and Dahl (1974)). We share the no-
tion of functional information structure as developed
by Dana (1974a). He distinguishes between two cru-
cial dichotomies, viz, given information vs. new infor-
mation (constituting the information structure of ut-
terances) on the one hand, and theme vs. rheme on
the other (constituting the thematic structure of utter-
ances; cf. Halliday &amp; Hasan (1976, pp.325-6)). Dana
refers to a definition given by Halliday (1967) to avoid
the confusion likely to arise in the use of these terms:
&amp;quot;[...] while given means what you were talking about
(or what I was talking about before), theme means
what! am talking about (now) [...]&amp;quot; Halliday (1967,
p.212). Dana concludes that the distinction between
given information and theme is justified, while the dis-
tinction between new information and rheme is not.
Thus, we arrive at a trichotomy between given infor-
mation, theme and rheme (the latter being equivalent
to new information). We here subscribe to these con-
siderations, too, and will return in Section 3 to these
notions in order to rephrase them more explicitly by
using the terminology of the centering model.
In this paper, we intend to make two contributions
to the centering approach. The first one, the intro-
duction of functional notions of information structure
in the centering model, is methodological in nature.
The second one concerns an empirical issue in that we
demonstrate how a functional model of centering can
successfully be applied to the analysis of several forms
of anaphoric text phenomena.
At the methodological level, we develop arguments
that (at least for free word order languages) grammat-
ical role indicators should be replaced by functional

role patterns to more adequately account for the or-
dering of discourse entities in center lists. In Section
3 we elaborate on the particular information structure
criteria underlying a function-based center ordering.
We also make a second, even more general method-
ological claim for which we have gathered some pre-
liminary, though still not conclusive evidence. Based
on a re-evaluation of empirical arguments discussed
in the literature on centering, we stipulate that ex-
changing grammatical by functional criteria is also a
reasonable strategy for fixed word order languages.
Grammatical role constraints can indeed be rephrased
by functional ones, which is simply due to the fact
that grammatical roles and the information structure
patterns, as we define them, coincide in these kinds
of languages. Hence, the proposal we make seems
more general than the ones currently under discus-
sion in that, given a functional framework, fixed and
free word order languages can be accounted for by the
same ordering principles. As a consequence, we argue
against Walker et al.&apos; s (1994, p.227) stipulation, which
assumes that the Cf ranking is the only parameter of
the centering theory which is language-dependent. In-
stead, we claim that functional centering constraints
for the Cf ranking are possibly universal.
The second major contribution of this paper is re-
lated to the unified treatment of specific text phe-
nomena. It consists of an equally balanced treatment
of intersentential (pro)nominal anaphora and textual
ellipsis (also called functional or partial anaphora).
The latter phenomenon (cf. the examples given in the
next section), in particular, is usually only sketchily
dealt with in the centering literature, e.g., by assert-
ing that the entity in question &amp;quot;is realized but not di-
rectly realized&amp;quot; (Grosz et al., 1995, p.217). Further-
more, the distinction between those two kinds of re-
alization is generally delegated to the underlying se-
mantic theory. We will develop arguments how to lo-
cate elliptical discourse entities and resolve textual el-
lipsis properly at the center level. The ordering con-
straints we supply account for all of the above men-
tioned types of anaphora in a precise way, includ-
ing (pro)nominal anaphora (Strube &amp; Hahn, 1995;
Hahn &amp; Strube, 1996). This claim will be validated
by a substantial body of empirical data (cf. Section 4).

2 Types of Anaphora Considered
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97982325">
Text phenomena, e.g., textual forms of ellipsis and
anaphora, are a challenging issue for the design of
parsers for text understanding systems, since imper-
fect recognition facilities either result in referentially
incoherent or invalid text knowledge representations.
At the conceptual level, textual ellipsis relates a quasi-
anaphoric expression to its extrasentential antecedent
by conceptual attributes (or roles) associated with that
antecedent (see, e.g., the relation between &amp;quot;Akkus&amp;quot;
(accumulator) and &amp;quot;316LT&amp;quot;, a particular notebook, in
(lb) and (la)). Thus, it complements the phenomenon
of nominal anaphora, where an anaphoric expression
is related to its antecedent in terms of conceptual gen-
eralization (as, e.g., &amp;quot;Rechner&amp;quot; (computer) in (1c)
refers to &amp;quot;316LT&amp;quot; in (la) mediated by the textual ellip-
sis in (lb)). The resolution of text-level nominal (and
pronominal) anaphora contributes to the construction
of referentially valid text knowledge bases, while the
resolution of textual ellipsis yields referentially coher-
ent text knowledge bases.

In the case of textual ellipsis, the missing concep-
tual link between two discourse elements occurring in
adjacent utterances must be inferred in order to estab-
lish the local coherence of the discourse (for an early
statement of that idea, cf. Clark (1975)). In the sur-
face form of utterance (lb) the information is missing
that &amp;quot;Akkus&amp;quot; (accumulator) links up with &amp;quot;316LT&amp;quot;.
This relation can only be made explicit if conceptual
knowledge about the domain, viz, the relation part-of
between the concepts ACCUMULATOR and 316LT, is
available (see Hahn et al. (1996) for a more detailed
treatment of text ellipsis resolution).

3 Principles of Functional Centering
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918">
Within the framework of the centering model
(Grosz et al., 1995), we distinguish each utterance&apos;s
backward-looking center (Cb (Un)) and its forward-
looking centers (Ci (Un )). The ranking imposed on
the elements of the Ci reflects the assumption that the
most highly ranked element of Cf(Un)— the preferred
center C(U) — is the most preferred antecedent of
an anaphoric or elliptical expression in Un+1, while
the remaining elements are partially ordered accord-
ing to decreasing preference for establishing referen-
tial links. Hence, the most important single construct
of the centering model is the ordering of the list of
forward-looking centers (Walker et al., 1994).

acterized by Table 1, an &amp;quot;intermediate&amp;quot; model which
can be considered a naive approach to free word order
languages, and, of course, the functional model based
on information structure constraints as stated in Table

of the naive and the canonical approaches will also be

constraint that elliptical antecedents are ranked higher
than elliptical expressions (short: &amp;quot;ante &gt; express&amp;quot;).
For the evaluation of a centering algorithm on nat-
urally occurring text it is necessary to specify how to
deal with complex sentences. In particular, methods
for the interaction between intra- and intersentential
anaphora resolution have to be defined, since the cen-
tering model is concerned only with the latter case (see
Suri &amp; McCoy (1994)). We use an approach as de-
scribed by Strube (1996) for the evaluation.
Since most of the anaphors in these texts are nom-
inal anaphors, the resolution of which is much more
restricted than that of pronominal anaphors, the rate of
success for the whole anaphora resolution process is
not significant enough for a proper evaluation of the
functional constraints. The reason for this lies in the
fact that nominal anaphors are far more constrained by
conceptual criteria than pronominal anaphors. So the
chance to properly resolve a nominal anaphor, even
at lower ranked positions in the center lists, is greater
than for pronominal anaphors. While we shift our
evaluation criteria away from simple anaphora resolu-
tion success data to structural conditions based on the
proper ordering of center lists (in particular, we focus
on the most highly ranked item of the forward-looking
centers) these criteria compensate for the high propor-
tion of nominal anaphora that occur in our test sets.
The types of centering transitions we make use of (cf.

4.2 Evaluation Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994746478874">
In Table 8 we give the numbers of centering transi-
tions between the utterances in the three test sets. The
first column contains those which are generated by the
naive approach (such a proposal was made by Gordon
et al. (1993) as well as by Rambow (1993) who, nev-
ertheless, restricts it to the German middlefield only).
We simply ranked the elements of Cf according to
their text position. While it is usually assumed that the
elliptical expression ranks above its antecedent (Grosz
et al., 1995, p.217), we assume the contrary. The sec-
ond column contains the results of this modification
with respect to the naive approach. In the third column
of Table 8 we give the numbers of transitions which
are generated by the canonical constraints as stated by
Grosz et al. (1995, p.214, 217). The fourth column
supplies the results of the same modification as was
used for the naive approach, viz, elliptical antecedents
are ranked higher than elliptical expressions. The fifth
column shows the results which are generated by the
functional constraints from Table 2.
First, we examine the error data for anaphora res-
olution for the five cases. All approaches have 99
errors in common. These are due to underspecifica-
tions at different levels, e.g., the failure to account
for prepositional anaphors (16), plural anaphors (8),
anaphors which refer to a member of a set (14), sen-
tence anaphors (21), and anaphors which refer to the
global focus (12). Only 6 errors of the functional ap-
proach are directly caused by an inappropriate order-
ing of the C1, while the naive approach leads to 10
errors and the canonical to 7. When the antecedent of
an elliptical expression is ranked above the elliptical
expression itself the error rate of these two augmented
approaches increases to 12 and 9, respectively.
We now turn to the distribution of transition types
for the different approaches. The centering model as-
sumes a preference order among these transitions, e.g.,
CONTINUE ranks above RETAIN and RETAIN ranks
above SHIFT. This preference order reflects the pre-
sumed inference load put on the hearer or speaker
to coherently decode or encode a discourse. Since
the functional approach generates a larger amount
of CONTINUE transitions, we interpret this as a first
rough indication that this approach provides for more
efficient processing than its competitors.
But this reasoning is not entirely conclusive. Count-
ing single occurrences of transition types, in general,
does not reveal the entire validity of the center lists.
Instead, considering adjacent transition pairs gives a
more reliable picture, since depending on the text sort
considered (e.g., technical vs. news magazine vs. lit-
erary texts) certain sequences of transition types may
be entirely plausible, though they include transitions
which, when viewed in isolation, seem to imply con-
siderable inferencing load (cf. Table 8). For instance,
a CONTINUE transition which follows a CONTINUE
transition is a sequence which requires the lowest pro-
cessing costs. But a CONTINUE transition which fol-
lows a RETAIN transition implies higher processing
costs than a SMOOTH-SHIFT transition following a
RETAIN transition. This is due to the fact that a RE-
TAIN transition ideally predicts a SMOOTH-SHIFT in
the following utterance. In this case the SMOOTH-
SHIFT is the &amp;quot;least effort&amp;quot; transition, because only the
first element of the Cf of the preceding utterance has
to be checked to perform the SMOOTH-SHIFT transi-
tion, while in the case of CONTINUE at least one more
check has to be performed. Hence, we claim that no
one particular centering transition is preferred over an-
other. Instead, we postulate that some centering tran-
sition pairs are preferred over others. Following this

line of argumentation, we here propose to classify all
occurrences of centering transition pairs with respect
to the costs they imply. The cost-based evaluation
of different Cf orderings refers to evaluation criteria
which form an intrinsic part of the centering mode16.
Transition pairs hold for two immediately succes-
sive utterances. We distinguish between two types of
transition pairs, cheap ones and expensive ones. We
call a transition pair cheap if the backward-looking
center of the current utterance is correctly predicted
by the preferred center of the immediately preced-
ing utterance, i.e., Cb(U1) Cp(Ui_i), i = 2 ... n.
Transition pairs are called expensive if the backward-
looking center of the current utterance is not correctly
predicted by the preferred center of the immediately
preceding utterance, i.e., Cb(U1) Cp(Ui-1)
2 ... n. Table 9 contains a detailed synopsis of cheap
and expensive transition pairs. In particular, chains
of the RETAIN transition in passages where the Cb
does not change (passages with constant theme) show
that the canonical ordering constraints for theforward-
looking centers are not appropriate.
The numbers of centering transition pairs generated
by the different approaches are shown in Table 10. In
general, the functional approach shows the best re-
6As a consequence of this postulate, we have to rede-
fine Rule 2 of the Centering Constraints (Grosz et al., 1995,
p.215) appropriately, which gives an informal characteriza-
tion of a preference for sequences of CONTINUE over se-
quences of RETAIN and, similarly, sequences of RETAIN
over sequences of SHIFT. Our specification for the case of
text interpretation says that cheap transitions are preferred
over expensive ones, with cheap and expensive transitions
as defined in Table 9.
sults, while the naive and the canonical approaches
work reasonably well for the literary text, but exhibit
a poor performance for the texts from the IT domain
and the news magazine. The results for the latter ap-
proaches become only slightly more positive with the
modification of ranking the antecedent of a textual el-
lipsis above the elliptical expression, but they do not
compare to the results of the functional approach.
We were also interested in finding out whether the
functional ordering we propose possibly &amp;quot;includes&amp;quot;
the grammatical role based criteria discussed so far.
We, therefore, re-evaluated the examples already an-
notated with Cb/Cf data available in the literature
(for the English language, we considered all exam-
ples from Grosz et al. (1995) and Brennan et al.
(1987); for Japanese we took the data from Walker
et al. (1994)). Surprisingly enough, all examples of
Grosz et al. (1995) passed the test successfully. Only
with respect to the troublesome Alfa Romeo driving
scenario (cf. Brennan et al. (1987, p.157)) our con-
straints fail to properly rank the elements of the third
sentence Cf of that example.7 Note also that these
results were achieved without having recourse to ex-
tra constraints, e.g., the shared property constraint to
account for anaphora parallelism (Kameyama, 1986).
We applied our constraints to Japanese examples in
the same way. Again we abandoned all extra con-
straints set up in these studies, e.g., the Zero Topic As-
signment (ZTA) rule and the special role of empathy

verbs (Walker et al., 1994). However, the results our
constraints generate are the same as those generated by
Walker et al. including these model extensions. Only a
single problematic case remains, viz. example (30) of
Walker et al. (1994, p.214) causes the same problems
they described (discourse-initial utterance, semantic
or world knowledge should be available). Even for
the crucial examples (32)-(36) of Walker et al. (1994,
p.216-221) our constraints generate the same Cis as
Walker et al.&apos; s constraints with ZTA.
To summarize the results of our empirical evalua-
tion, we first claim that our proposal based on func-
tional criteria leads to substantially better and — with
respect to the inference load placed on the text under-
stander, whether human or machine — more plausi-
ble results for languages with free word order than the
structural constraints given by Grosz et al. (1995) and
those underlying a naive approach. We base these ob-
servations on an evaluation approach which considers
transition pairs in terms of the inference load specific
pairs imply. Second, we have gathered some evidence,
still far from being conclusive, that the functional con-
straints on centering seem to incorporate the struc-
tural constraints for English and the modified struc-
tural constraints for Japanese. Hence, we hypothesize
that functional constraints on centering might consti-
tute a general mechanism for treating free and fixed
word order languages by the same descriptive mecha-
nism. This claim, however, has to be further substan-
tiated by additional cross-linguistic empirical studies.

5 Comparison with Related Approaches
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997765">
The centering model (Grosz et al., 1983; 1995) is con-
cerned with the interactions between the local coher-
ence of discourse and the choices of referring expres-
sions. Crucial for the centering model is the way
the forward-looking centers are organized. Despite
several cross-linguistic studies a kind of &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot;
has emerged based on the study of English (cf. Ta-
ble 1 in Section 1). Only few of these cross-linguistic
studies have led to changes in the basic order of dis-
course entities, the work of Walker et al. (1990;
1994) being the most far reaching exception. They
consider the role of expressive means in Japanese to
indicate topic status and the speaker&apos;s perspective,
thus introducing functional notions, viz. TOPIC and
EMPATHY, into the discussion. German, the object
language we deal with, is also a free word order lan-
guage like Japanese (possibly even more constrained).
Our basic revision of the ordering scheme completely
abandons grammatical role information and replaces it
with entirely functional notions reflecting the informa-
tion structure of the utterances in the discourse. Inter-
estingly enough, several extra assumptions introduced
to account, e.g., for anaphora parallelism (e.g., the
shared property constraint formulated by Kameyama
(1986)) can be eliminated without affecting the cor-
rectness of anaphora resolutions. Rambow (1993) has
presented a theme/rheme distinction within the cen-
tering model to which we fully subscribe. His pro-
posal concerning the centering analysis of German (al-
ready referred to as the &amp;quot;naive&amp;quot; approach; cf. Section
4) is limited, however, to the German middlefield and,
hence, incomplete.
A common topic of criticism relating to focusing
approaches to anaphora resolution has been the diver-
sity of data structures they require, which are likely
to hide the underlying linguistic regularities. Focus-
ing algorithms prefer the discourse element already
in focus for anaphora resolution, thus considering
context-&apos;boundedness, too. But the items of the fo-
cus lists are either ordered by thematic roles (Sidner,

1983) or grammatical roles (Suri &amp; McCoy, 1994;
Dahl &amp; Ball, 1990)). Dahl &amp; Ball (1990) improve
the focusing mechanism by simplifying its data struc-
tures and, thus, their proposal is more closely related
to the centering model than any other focusing mecha-
nism. But their approach still relies upon grammatical
information for the ordering of the centering list, while
we use only the functional information structure as the
guiding principle.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992975625">
In this paper, we provided an account for ordering
the forward-looking centers which is entirely based on
functional notions, grounded on the information struc-
ture of utterances in a discourse. We motivated our
proposal by the constraints which hold for a free word
order language such as German and derived our results
from data-intensive empirical studies of (real-world)
expository texts. We have gathered preliminary evi-
dence that the functional ordering of discourse enti-
ties in the centers seems to coincide with the gram-
matical roles of fixed word order languages. We also
augmented the ordering criteria of the forward-looking
center such that it accounts not only for (pro)nominal
but also for functional anaphora (textual ellipsis), an
issue that, so far, has only been sketchily dealt with
in the centering framework. The extensions we pro-
pose have been validated by the empirical analysis of
real-world expository texts of considerable length. We
thus follow methodological principles of corpus-based
studies that have been successfully exercised in the
work of Passonneau (1993). Still open are proper de-
scriptions of deictic expressions, proper names (cf. the
Alfa Romeo driving scenario), and plural or generic
definite noun phrases. An anaphora resolution module
and an ellipsis handler based on this functional center-
ing model has been implemented as part of a compre-
hensive text parser for German.

Crucial for the centering model is the way the forward-looking centers are organized. Despite several cross-linguistic studies a kind of &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; has emerged based on the study of English (cf. Table 1 in Section 1).

Instead, we claim that functional centering constraints for the Cf ranking are possibly universal. The second major contribution of this paper is related to the unified treatment of specific text phenomena. It consists of an equally balanced treatment of intersentential (pro)nominal anaphora and textual ellipsis (also called functional or partial anaphora). The latter phenomenon (cf. the examples given in the next section), in particular, is usually only sketchily dealt with in the centering literature, e.g., by asserting that the entity in question &amp;quot;is realized but not directly realized&amp;quot; (Grosz et al., 1995, p.217). Furthermore, the distinction between those two kinds of realization is generally delegated to the underlying semantic theory. We will develop arguments how to locate elliptical discourse entities and resolve textual ellipsis properly at the center level. The ordering constraints we supply account for all of the above mentioned types of anaphora in a precise way, including (pro)nominal anaphora (Strube &amp; Hahn, 1995; Hahn &amp; Strube, 1996). This claim will be validated by a substantial body of empirical data (cf. Section 4). 2 Types of Anaphora Considered Text phenomena, e.g., textual fo</context>

Clark (1975)). In the surface form of utterance (lb) the information is missing that &amp;quot;Akkus&amp;quot; (accumulator) links up with &amp;quot;316LT&amp;quot;. This relation can only be made explicit if conceptual knowledge about the domain, viz, the relation part-of between the concepts ACCUMULATOR and 316LT, is available (see Hahn et al. (1996) for a more detailed treatment of text ellipsis resolution). 3 Principles of Functional Centering Within the framework of the centering model (Grosz et al., 1995), we distinguish each utterance&apos;s backward-looking center (Cb (Un)) and its forwardlooking centers (Ci (Un )). The ranking imposed on the elements of the Ci reflects the assumption that the most highly ranked element of Cf(Un)— the preferred center C(U) — is the most preferred antecedent of an anaphoric or elliptical expression in Un+1, while the remaining elements are partially ordered according to decreasing preference for establishing referential links. Hence, the most important single construct of the centering model is the ordering of the list of forward-looking centers (Walker et al., 19</context>

Table 7: Transition Types 4.2 Evaluation Results In Table 8 we give the numbers of centering transitions between the utterances in the three test sets. The first column contains those which are generated by the naive approach (such a proposal was made by Gordon et al. (1993) as well as by Rambow (1993) who, nevertheless, restricts it to the German middlefield only). We simply ranked the elements of Cf according to their text position. While it is usually assumed that the elliptical expression ranks above its antecedent (Grosz et al., 1995, p.217), we assume the contrary. The second column contains the results of this modification with respect to the naive approach. In the third column of Table 8 we give the numbers of transitions which are generated by the canonical constraints as stated by Grosz et al. (1995, p.214, 217). The fourth column supplies the results of the same modification as was used for the naive approach, viz, elliptical antecedents are ranked higher than elliptical expressions.

Table 9 contains a detailed synopsis of cheap and expensive transition pairs. In particular, chains of the RETAIN transition in passages where the Cb does not change (passages with constant theme) show that the canonical ordering constraints for theforwardlooking centers are not appropriate. The numbers of centering transition pairs generated by the different approaches are shown in Table 10. In general, the functional approach shows the best re6As a consequence of this postulate, we have to redefine Rule 2 of the Centering Constraints (Grosz et al., 1995, p.215) appropriately, which gives an informal characterization of a preference for sequences of CONTINUE over sequences of RETAIN and, similarly, sequences of RETAIN over sequences of SHIFT.

We were also interested in finding out whether the functional ordering we propose possibly &amp;quot;includes&amp;quot; the grammatical role based criteria discussed so far. We, therefore, re-evaluated the examples already annotated with Cb/Cf data available in the literature (for the English language, we considered all examples from Grosz et al. (1995) and Brennan et al. (1987); for Japanese we took the data from Walker et al. (1994)). Surprisingly enough, all examples of Grosz et al. (1995) passed the test successfully. Only with respect to the troublesome Alfa Romeo driving scenario (cf. Brennan et al. (1987, p.157)) our constraints fail to properly rank the elements of the third sentence Cf of that example.7 Note also that these results were achieved without having recourse to extra constraints, e.g., the shared property constraint to account for anaphora parallelism (Kameyama, 1986). We applied our constraints to Japanese examples in the same way. Again we abandoned all extra constraints set up in these studies, e.g., the Zero Topic Assignment (ZTA) rule and the special role </context>

Even for the crucial examples (32)-(36) of Walker et al. (1994, p.216-221) our constraints generate the same Cis as Walker et al.&apos; s constraints with ZTA. To summarize the results of our empirical evaluation, we first claim that our proposal based on functional criteria leads to substantially better and — with respect to the inference load placed on the text understander, whether human or machine — more plausible results for languages with free word order than the structural constraints given by Grosz et al. (1995) and those underlying a naive approach. We base these observations on an evaluation approach which considers transition pairs in terms of the inference load specific pairs imply. Second, we have gathered some evidence, still far from being conclusive, that the functional constraints on centering seem to incorporate the structural constraints for English and the modified structural constraints for Japanese. Hence, we hypothesize that functional constraints on centering might constitute a general mechanism for treating free and fixed word order languages by the same descriptive mechanism.

(1995)), an almost canonical scheme for the ordering on the forward-looking centers has emerged, one that reflects well-known regularities of fixed word order languages such as English. With the exception of Walker et al.

The types of centering transitions we make use of (cf. Table 7) are taken from Walker et al. (1994). Table 7: Transition Types 4.2 Evaluation Results In Table 8 we give the numbers of centering transitions between the utterances in the three test sets. The first column contains those which are generated by the naive approach (such a proposal was made by Gordon et al. (1993) as well as by Rambow (1993) who, nevertheless, restricts it to the German middlefield only). We simply ranked the elements of Cf according to their text position. While it is usually assumed that the elliptical expression ranks above its antecedent (Grosz et al., 1995, p.217), we assume the contrary. The second column contains the results of this modification with respect to the naive approach.

Crucial for the centering model is the way the forward-looking centers are organized. Despite several cross-linguistic studies a kind of &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; has emerged based on the study of English (cf. Table 1 in Section 1). Only few of these cross-linguistic studies have led to changes in the basic order of discourse entities, the work of Walker et al. (1990; 1994) being the most far reaching exception. They consider the role of expressive means in Japanese to indicate topic status and the speaker&apos;s perspective, thus introducing functional notions, viz. TOPIC and EMPATHY, into the discussion. German, the object language we deal with, is also a free word order language like Japanese (possibly even more constrained). Our basic revision of the ordering scheme completely abandons grammatical role information and replaces it with entirely functional notions reflecting the information structure of the utterances in the discourse.

The ranking imposed on the elements of the Ci reflects the assumption that the most highly ranked element of Cf(Un)— the preferred center C(U) — is the most preferred antecedent of an anaphoric or elliptical expression in Un+1, while the remaining elements are partially ordered according to decreasing preference for establishing referential links. Hence, the most important single construct of the centering model is the ordering of the list of forward-looking centers (Walker et al., 1994). 271 The main difference between Grosz et al.&apos; s work The rules holding for the ranking on the C1, derived and our proposal concerns the criteria for ranking the from a German language corpus, are summarized in forward-looking centers. While Grosz et al. assume Table 2. They are organized into three layers2.

So the chance to properly resolve a nominal anaphor, even at lower ranked positions in the center lists, is greater than for pronominal anaphors. While we shift our evaluation criteria away from simple anaphora resolution success data to structural conditions based on the proper ordering of center lists (in particular, we focus on the most highly ranked item of the forward-looking centers) these criteria compensate for the high proportion of nominal anaphora that occur in our test sets. The types of centering transitions we make use of (cf. Table 7) are taken from Walker et al. (1994). Table 7: Transition Types 4.2 Evaluation Results In Table 8 we give the numbers of centering transitions between the utterances in the three test sets. The first column contains those which are generated by the naive approach (such a proposal was made by Gordon et al. (1993) as well as by Rambow (1993) who, nevertheless, restricts it to the German middlefield only). We simply ranked the elements of Cf according to their text position. While it is usually assumed that the elliptical expression ranks above its antecedent (Grosz et al., 1995, p.217), we assume the contrary. The second column co</context>

We were also interested in finding out whether the functional ordering we propose possibly &amp;quot;includes&amp;quot; the grammatical role based criteria discussed so far. We, therefore, re-evaluated the examples already annotated with Cb/Cf data available in the literature (for the English language, we considered all examples from Grosz et al. (1995) and Brennan et al. (1987); for Japanese we took the data from Walker et al. (1994)). Surprisingly enough, all examples of Grosz et al. (1995) passed the test successfully. Only with respect to the troublesome Alfa Romeo driving scenario (cf. Brennan et al. (1987, p.157)) our constraints fail to properly rank the elements of the third sentence Cf of that example.7 Note also that these results were achieved without having recourse to extra constraints, e.g., the shared property constraint to account for anaphora parallelism (Kameyama, 1986). We applied our constraints to Japanese examples in the same way. Again we abandoned all extra constraints set up in these studies, e.g.,</context>

Only a single problematic case remains, viz. example (30) of Walker et al. (1994, p.214) causes the same problems they described (discourse-initial utterance, semantic or world knowledge should be available). Even for the crucial examples (32)-(36) of Walker et al.
