The use of structural and syntactic information in
language processing implementations in recent
years has been producing contradictory results.
Whereas language generation has benefited from
syntax [Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al., 2000], the per-
formance of statistical phrase-based machine trans-
lation when relying solely on syntactic phrases has
been reported to be poor [Koehn et al., 2003].
We carry out a set of experiments to explore
whether heuristic learning of part-of-speech pat-
terns from a parallel corpus can be used to enhance
phrase-based translation resources.

The resources used for our experiments are as fol-
lows. The statistical machine translation GIZA++
toolkit was used to generate a bilingual translation
table from the French-English parallel and sen-
tence-aligned Europarl corpus. Additionally, a
phrase table generated from the Europarl French-
English corpus, and a training test set of 2000
French and English sentences that were made
available on the webpage of the ACL 2005 work-
shop1 were also used. Syntactic tagging was real-
ized by the TreeTagger, which is a probabilistic
part-of-speech tagger and lemmatizer. The decoder
used to produce machine translations was Pharaoh,
version 1.2.3.
We used GIZA++ to generate a translation table
from the parallel corpus. The table produced con-
sisted of individual words and phrases, followed by
their corresponding translation and a unique prob-
ability value. Specifically, every line of the said
table consisted of a French entry (in the form of
one or more tokens), followed by an English entry
(in the form of one or more tokens), followed by
P(f|e), which is the probability P of translation to
the French entry f given the English entry e. We
added the GIZA++-generated table to the phrase-
based translation table downloaded from the work-
shop webpage. During this merging of translation
tables, no word or phrase was omitted, replaced or
altered. We chose to combine the two aforemen-
tioned translation tables in order to achieve better
coverage. We called the resulting merged transla-
tion table lexical phrase table.
In order to utilize the syntactic information
stemming from our resources, we used the Tree-
Tagger to tag both the parallel corpus and the lexi-
cal phrase table. The probability values included
in the lexical phrase table were not tagged. The
TreeTagger uses a slightly modified version of the
Penn Treebank tagset, different for each language.
In order to achieve tag-uniformity, we performed
the following dual tag-smoothing operation.

Firstly, we changed the French tags into their Eng-
lish equivalents, i.e. NOM (noun – French) became
NN (noun – English). Secondly, we simplified the
tags, so that they reflected nothing more than gen-
eral part-of-speech information. For example, tags
denoting predicate-argument structures, wh-
movement, passive voice, inflectional variation,
and so on, were simplified. For example, NNS
(noun – plural) became NN (noun).
Once our resources were uniformly tagged, we
used them to extract part-of-speech correspon-
dences between the two languages. Specifically,
we extracted a sentence-aligned parallel corpus of
French and English part-of-speech patterns from
the tagged Europarl parallel corpus. We called this
corpus of parallel and corresponding part-of-
speech patterns pos-corpus. The format of the pos-
corpus remained identical to the format of the
original parallel corpus, with the sole difference
that individual words were replaced by their corre-
sponding part-of-speech tag. Similarly, we ex-
tracted a translation table of part-of-speech patterns
from the tagged lexical phrase table. We called
this part-of-speech translation table pos-table. The
pos-table had exactly the same format as the lexi-
cal phrase table, with the unique difference that
individual words were replaced by their corre-
sponding part-of-speech tag. The translation prob-
ability values included in the lexical phrase table
were copied onto the pos-table intact.
Each of the part-of-speech patterns contained in
the pos-corpus was matched against the part-of-
speech patterns contained in the pos-table. Match-
ing was realized similarly to conventional left-to-
right string matching operations. Matching was
considered to be successful not simply when a
part-of-speech pattern was found to be contained
in, or part of a longer pattern, but when patterns
were found to be absolutely identical. When a per-
fect match was found, the translation probability
value of the specific pattern in the pos-table was
increased to the maximum value of 1. If the score
were already 1, it remained unchanged. When
there were no matches, values remained un-
changed. We chose to match identical part-of-
speech patterns, and not to accept partial pattern
matches, because the latter would require a revi-
sion of our probability recomputation method. This
point is discussed in section 3 of this paper.
Once all matching was complete, the newly en-
hanced pos-table, which now contained translation
probability scores reflecting the syntactic features
of the relevant languages, was used to update the
original lexical phrase table. This update consisted
in matching each and every part-of-speech pattern
with its original lexical phrase, and replacing the
initial translation probability score with the values
contained in the pos-table. The identification of the
original lexical phrases that generated each and
every part-of-speech pattern was facilitated by the
use of pattern-identifiers (pos-ids) and phrase-
identifiers (phrase-ids), which were introduced at a
very early stage in the process for that purpose.
The resulting translation phrase table contained
exactly the same entries as the lexical phrase table,
but had different probability scores assigned to
some of these entries, in line with the parallel part-
of-speech co-occurrences and correspondences
found in the Europarl corpus. We called this table
enhanced phrase table. Table 1 illustrates the
process described above with the example of a
phrase, the part-of-speech analysis of which has
been used to increase its original translation prob-
ability value from 0.333333 to 1.

The motivation behind this investigation has been
to test whether syntactic or structural language as-
pects can be reflected or represented in the re-
sources used in statistical phrase-based machine
translation.
We adopted a line of investigation that concen-
trates on the correspondence of part-of-speech pat-
terns between French and English. We measured
the usability of syntactic structures for statistical
phrase-based machine translation by comparing
translation performance when a standard phrase
table was used, and when a syntactically enhanced
phrase table was used. Both approaches scored
very similarly. This similarity in the performance
is justified by the following three factors.
Firstly, the difference between the two transla-
tion resources, namely the lexical phrase table and
the enhanced phrase table, does not relate to their
entries, and thus their coverage, but to a simple
alteration of the translation probability values of
some of their entries. The coverage of these re-
sources is exactly identical.
Secondly, a closer examination of the transla-
tion probability value alterations that took place in
order to reflect part-of-speech correspondences
reveals that the proportion of the entries of the
phrase table that were matched syntactically to
phrases from the parallel corpus, and thus under-
went a modification in their translation probability
score, was very low (less than 1%). The reason
behind this is the fact that the part-of-speech pat-
terns produced by the parallel corpus were long
strings in their vast majority, while the part-of-
speech patterns found in the phrase table were sig-
nificantly shorter strings. The inclusion of phrases
longer than three words in translation resources has
been avoided, as it has been shown not to have a
strong impact on translation performance [Koehn
et al., 2003].
Thirdly, the above described translation prob-
ability value modifications were not parameterized,
but consisted in a straightforward increase of the
translation probability to its maximum value. It
remains to be seen how these probability value
alterations can be expanded to a type of probability
value ‘reweighing’, in line with specific parame-
ters, such as the size of the resources involved, the
frequency of part-of-speech patterns in the re-
sources, the length of part-of-speech patterns, as
well as the syntactic classification of the members
of part-of-speech patterns. If one is to compare the
impact that such parameters have had upon the
performance of automatic information summarisa-
tion [Mani, 2001] and retrieval technology [Belew,
2000], it may be worth experimenting with such
parameter tuning when refining machine transla-
tion resources.
A note should be made to the choice of tagger
for our experiments. A possible risk when attempt-
ing any syntactic examination of a large set of data
may stem from the overriding role that syntax of-
ten assumes over semantics. Statistical phrase-
based machine translation has been faced with in-
stances of this phenomenon, often disguised as
linguistic idiosyncrasies. This phenomenon ac-
counts for such instances as when nouns appear in
pronominal positions, or as adverbial modifiers.
On these occasions, and in order for the syntactic
examination to be precise, words would have to be
defined on the basis of their syntactic distribution
rather than their semantic function. The TreeTag-
ger abides by this convention, which is one of the
main reasons why we chose it over a plethora of
other freely available taggers, the remaining rea-
sons being its high speed and low error rate. In ad-
dition, it should be clarified that there is no
statistical, linguistic, or other reason why we chose
to adopt the English version of the Penn TreeBank
tagset over the French, as they are both equally
conclusive and transparent.
The overall driving force behind our investiga-
tion has been to test whether part-of-speech struc-
tures can be of assistance to the enhancement of
translation resources for statistical phrase-based
machine translation. We view our use of part-of-
speech patterns as a natural extension to the intro-
duction of structural elements to statistical machine
translation by Wang [1998] and Och et al. [1999].

Our empirical results suggest that the use of part-
of-speech pattern correspondences to enhance ex-
isting translation resources does not damage ma-
chine translation performance. What remains to be
investigated is how this approach can be opti-
mized, and how it would respond to known statis-
tical machine translation issues, such as mapping
nested structures, or the handling of ‘unorthodox’
language pairs, i.e. agglutinative-fusion languages.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999392">
Syntactic and structural language information con-
tained in a bilingual parallel corpus has been ex-
tracted and used to refine the translation
probability values of a translation phrase table,
using simple heuristics. The usability of the said
translation table in statistical phrase-based machine
translation has been tested in the shared task of the
second track of the ACL 2005 Workshop on Build-
ing and Using Parallel Corpora. Findings suggest
that using part-of-speech information to alter trans-
lation probabilities has had no significant effect
upon translation performance. Further investiga-
tion is required to reveal how our approach can be
optimized in order to produce significant perform-
ance improvement.

Whereas language generation has benefited from syntax [Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al., 2000], the performance of statistical phrase-based machine translation when relying solely on syntactic phrases has been reported to be poor [Koehn et al., 2003]. We carry out a set of experiments to explore whether heuristic learning of part-of-speech patterns from a parallel corpus can be used to enhance phrase-based translation resources. 2 System The resources used for our experiments are as follows. The statistical machine translation GIZA++ toolkit was used to generate a bilingual translation table from the French-English parallel and sentence-aligned Europarl corpus. A</context>
