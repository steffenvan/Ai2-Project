This paper describes the participation of
the SINAI research group in the 2013 edi-
tion of the International Workshop Se-
mEval. The SINAI research group has
submitted two systems, which cover the
two main approaches in the field of sen-
timent analysis: supervised and unsuper-
vised.

In the last years, the sentiment analysis (SA) re-
search community wants to go one step further,
which consists in studying different texts that
usually can be found in commerce websites or
opinions websites. Currently, the users publish
their opinions through other platforms, being one
of the most important the microblogging plat-
form Twitter1. Thus, the SA research commu-
nity is focused on the study of opinions that users
publish through Twitter. This interest is shown in
several workshops focused on the study of SA in
Twitter:

2012 Conference to foster the research in
the field of SA in social media, specifically

In this paper is described the participation of
the SINAI4 research group in the second task of
the 2013 edition of the International Workshop
SemEval (Wilson et al., 2013). We have submit-
ted two systems (constrained and unconstrained).
The constrained system follows a supervised ap-
proach, while the unconstrained system is based
on an unsupervised approach which used two lin-
guistic resources: the Sentiment Analysis Lexi-
cons (Hu and Liu, 2004) and WeFeelFine6 (Kam-
var and Harris, 2011).
The paper is organized as follows: first we
present a description of the preparing data pro-
cess. Then the constrained system is outlined.
The participation overview finishes with the de-
scription of the unconstrained system.

The organizers provided two sets of data, one for
training and another for the development. The
data was concerned by a set of identification
number of tweets with their corresponding po-
larity label. We used the script provided by the
organizers to download the two sets of tweets.

Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM), Volume 2: Seventh International Workshop on Semantic
Evaluation (SemEval 2013), pages 402–407, Atlanta, Georgia, June 14-15, 2013. c�2013 Association for Computational Linguistics
The python script was no able to download all the
tweets. The training set was composed by 8,633
tweets and the development set by 1,053 tweets.
The data preparation is a step in the workflow
of most data mining tasks. Also, in Natural Lan-
guage Processing is usual the preparation of the
documents or the texts for their further process-
ing. Internet is usually the source of texts for SA
tasks, so the application of a specific processing
to those texts with the aim of extracting their po-
larity is recommended. The texts published in
Twitter have several issues that must be resolved
before processing them:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8855538">
1. The linguistic style of tweets is usually in-
formal, with a intensive usage of abbrevia-
tions, idioms, and jargon.
2. The users do not care about the correct use
of grammar, which increases the difficulty
of carrying out a linguistic analysis.
3. Because the maximum length of a tweet is
140 characters, the users normally refer to
the same concept with a large variety of
short and irregular forms. This problems is
known as data sparsity, and it is a challenge
for the sentiment-topic task.
4. The lack of context, which makes difficult
to extract the semantics of these sort pieces
of text.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999151777777778">
Before applying a cleaning process to the cor-
pus with the aim of overcoming the issues de-
scribed above, we have studied the different
kinds of marks, like emoticons, question and ex-
clamation marks or hashtags in the tweets.
Regarding the issues listed above and the
marks in the tweets, we have carried out a clean-
ing and a normalization process which imply the
following operations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.975665086956522">
1. The uppercase characters have been ex-
changed by lowercase characters.
2. Links have been replaced by the token
“ ULR ”.
3. Question and exclamation marks have been
switched to the tokens “ QUESTION ” and
“ EXCLAMATION ” respectively.
4. Mentions7 have been exchanged by the to-
ken “ MENTION ”.
5. All the HTML tags have been removed.
6. The hashtags8 have been normalized with
the token “ HASHTAG ”.
7. Tokens that express laughing (hahaha,
hehehe...) have been normalized with the
token “ LAUGH ”.
8. Users usually write expressions or abbrevi-
ations for surprise phrases like omg. All
these kind of expressions are replaced by the
token “ SURPRISE ”.
9. Positive emoticons like:), ;) or :, have been
normalized with the token “ HAPPY ”.
10. Negative emoticons like :(, :’( or :-( have
been normalized with the token “ SAD ”.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.945665">
11. Twitter users usually repeat letters to em-
phasize the idea that they want to express.
Therefore, all the words with a letter re-
peated more than two times have been re-
duced to only two instances. For exam-
ple, the word “aaaamaaaaaziiiing” in tweet
111733236627025920 is transformed into
“aamaaziing”.
After applying a normalization process to the
training and development sets, we have used for
the constrained system and the unsconstrained
system a dataset of 9,686 tweets.

3 Constrained System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897888888889">
The guidelines of the task define a constrained
system as a system that only can use the train
data provided by the organizers. Due to this re-
striction we decided to follow a supervised ap-
proach. It is required to define a set of parame-
ters when the supervised method is the elected.
The first step is to choose the minimum unit of
information, i.e. what segments of text are con-
sidered as features. Pang et al. (2002) assert that

opinions or reviews should be represented with
unigrams, but other work shows bigrams and tri-
grams outperformed the unigrams features (Dave
et al., 2003). Therefore, there is not agreement
in the SA research community about what is the
best choice, unigrams or n-grams. Before several
validations on the training set of the task we de-
cided to use unigrams as feature for the polarity
classification process. Thus, for the supervised
algorithm, we have represented each tweet as a
vector of unigrams.
The next decision was about the application
of a stemmer process and getting rid off the En-
glish stop words. We only have applied stemmer
process to the data because in previous works
(Martinez-C´amara et al., 2013a) we did not reach
good results removing the stop words in texts
from Twitter. Another topic of discussion in the
SA research community is the weighting scheme.
Pang et al. (2002) weighted each unigram fol-
lowing a binary scheme. Also, in the most cited
survey about SA (Pang and Lee, 2008) the au-
thors indicated that the overall sentiment may not
usually be highlighted through repeated use of
the same terms. On the other hand, Martinez-
C´amara et al. (2011) achieved the best results
using TF-IDF as weighting scheme. Due to the
lack of agreement in the SA research community
about the use of a specific weight scheme, we
have carried out several assessments with aim of
deciding the most suitable one for the task. The
machine learning algorithm selected for the eval-
uation was SVM. The results are shown in Tables
1 and 2.
The results achieved with the two weighting
schemes are very similar. Regarding the posi-
tive class, the binary weighting scheme obtains
better results than the TF-IDF one, so the pres-
ence of positive keywords is more useful than
the frequent occurrence of those keywords. For
the neutral class, regarding precision and F1-
score, the TF-IDF scheme outperformed the bi-
nary scheme, but the recall had a higher value
when the terms are weighted binary. The pre-
cision of the classification for the neutral class
is only 1.2% better than the case where TF-IDF
is used, while recall and the F1-score is better
when the weighting of the features is binary. Al-
though the negative class has a similar perfor-
mance to that of the positive one with the two
weighting schemes, we highlighted the high dif-
ference between the other two classes and the
negative. The difference is more evident in the
recall value, while the neutral class has a value
of 0.8313 (binary), the negative one has a value
of 0.2105 (binary). Therefore, due to the fact that
the binary weighting scheme achieved better re-
sults in average, we decided to use it in the final
system.
The last step in the configuration of a su-
pervised approach based on machine learning is
the selection of the algorithm. The algorithm
selected was Support Vector Machine (SVM)
(Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). Our decision is based
on the widely used SVM by the research com-
munity of SA. The first application of SVM for
SA was in (Pang et al., 2002) with good re-
sults. Since the publication of the previous work,
other researchers have used SVM, and some of
them are: (Zhang et al., 2009), (Pang and Lee,
2004) and (Jindal and Liu, 2006). Also, the al-
gorithm SVM has been used to classify the po-
larity over tweets (Go et al., 2009) (Zhang et al.,
2011) (Jiang et al., 2011). A broader review of
the research about SA in Twitter can be found in
(Martinez-C´amara et al., 2013b). Furthermore,
our decision is supported by previous in-house
experimentation.

<bodyText confidence="0.988919375">
For the experimentation we have used the
framework for data mining RapidMiner9. In
RapidMiner there are several implementations
of SVM, among which we have selected Lib-
SVM10(Chang and Lin, 2011) with built-in de-
fault parametrization.
To sum up, the configuration of the SINAI
constrained system is:

1. Machine learning approach: Supervised

4 Unconstrained System
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928916666667">
Our unconstrained system follows a two level
categorization approach, determining whether
the tweet is subjective or not at a first stage, and,
for the subjective classified ones, whether the
tweet is positive or negative. Both classification
phases are fully based on knowledge resources.
A predefined list of affective words is used for
subjectivity detection, and a search process over
the collection of emotions generated from a web
resource is applied for final polarity classifica-
tion. Figure 1 shows a general diagram of the
system.

<bodyText confidence="0.999933">
The system based in WeFeelFine only catego-
rizes between positive and negative texts, so a
preliminary classification into subjective and ob-
jective (i.e. neutral) must be performed. To this
end, a lexical approach is followed: those tweets
containing at least one affective term from a list
of predefined ones are considered subjective. If

affective terms are not found, then the tweet is
directly labeled as neutral. This list is called Sen-
timent Analysis Lexicon (SAL), which is defined
in the work of Bing Liu (Hu and Liu, 2004). The
list has two differentiated groups: a list of posi-
tive terms (agile, enjoy, improving) and another
with negative ones (anger, refusing, unable...).
At this phase, the polarity is not considered, so
both lists are merged into a list of around 6,800
subjectivity terms.

The WeFeelFine project (Kamvar and Harris,
2011) has been used as knowledge base for po-
larity classification following the approach pro-
posed by (Montejo-R´aez, 2013). WeFeelFine11
gathers affective texts from several blogs, cre-
ating a huge database of mood-related expres-
sions. Almost two millions “feelings” are col-
lected and indexed by the system. It is possible
to retrieve related sentences and expressions by
using its API. In this way, we have obtained the

top 200 most frequent feelings. For each feeling,
about 1,500 sentences are include in a document
that represents such a feeling. Then, using the
Lucene12 search engine, these documents have
been indexed. In this way, we can use an incom-
ing tweet as query and retrieve a ranked list of
feelings, as shown in Figure 2.

<figureCaption confidence="0.994914">

<bodyText confidence="0.999996">
The ranked list with the top 100 feelings (i.e.
those feelings more related to the tweet) is taken
for computing the final polarity by a summation
of the manually assigned polarity of the feeling
weighted with the score value returned by the en-
gine, as shown in Equation 1.

p(t) is the polarity of tweet t
R is the list of retrieved feelings
lr is the polarity label of feeling r

As we did with the constrained system, we
also assess the unconstrained system before ap-
plying the test data. The results reached during
the evaluation phase are shown in Table 3. It is
remarkable the fact that the precision value of the
unconstrained system is a bit higher than the one

SAL is a good resource for subjective classifi-
cation tasks. The unconstrained system reached
worse results with positive and negative classes,
but it is an expected result because supervised
approaches usually obtain better results than the
unsupervised and knowledge based approaches.
However, the polarity classification has reached
acceptable results, so it encourage us to follow
improving the method based of the use of We-
FeelFine.

The difference is more evident in the recall value, while the neutral class has a value of 0.8313 (binary), the negative one has a value of 0.2105 (binary). Therefore, due to the fact that the binary weighting scheme achieved better results in average, we decided to use it in the final system.

Therefore, there is not agreement in the SA research community about what is the best choice, unigrams or n-grams. Before several validations on the training set of the task we decided to use unigrams as feature for the polarity classification process. Thus, for the supervised algorithm, we have represented each tweet as a vector of unigrams.

We have submitted two systems (constrained and unconstrained). The constrained system follows a supervised approach, while the unconstrained system is based on an unsupervised approach which used two linguistic resources: the Sentiment Analysis Lexicons (Hu and Liu, 2004) and WeFeelFine6 (Kamvar and Harris, 2011). The paper is organized as follows: first we present a description of the preparing data process. Then the constrained system is outlined. The participation overview finishes with the description of the unconstrained system. 2 Preparing data The organizers provided two sets of data, one for training and another for the development. The data was concerned by a set of identification number of tweets with their corresponding polarity label. We used the script provided by the organizers to download the two sets of tweets. 3http://www.daedalus.es/TASS/ 4ht</context>

The next decision was about the application of a stemmer process and getting rid off the English stop words. We only have applied stemmer process to the data because in previous works (Martinez-C´amara et al., 2013a) we did not reach good results removing the stop words in texts from Twitter. Another topic of discussion in the SA research community is the weighting scheme. Pang et al. (2002) weighted each unigram following a binary scheme. Also, in the most cited survey about SA (Pang and Lee, 2008) the authors indicated that the overall sentiment may not usually be highlighted through repeated use of the same terms. On the other hand, MartinezC´amara et al. (2011) achieved the best results using TF-IDF as weighting scheme. Due to the lack of agreement in the SA research community about the use of a specific weight scheme, we have carried out several assessments with aim of deciding the most suitable one for the task. The machine learning algorithm selected for the evaluation was SVM. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The results achieved with the two weighting schemes are very si</context>

After applying a normalization process to the training and development sets, we have used for the constrained system and the unsconstrained system a dataset of 9,686 tweets. 3 Constrained System The guidelines of the task define a constrained system as a system that only can use the train data provided by the organizers. Due to this restriction we decided to follow a supervised approach. It is required to define a set of parameters when the supervised method is the elected. The first step is to choose the minimum unit of information, i.e. what segments of text are considered as features. Pang et al. (2002) assert that 7A twitter mention is a reference to another user which has the pattern “@user name” 8A hashtag is the way to refer a topic in Twitter, which has the pattern “#topic name” 403 Class Precision Recall F1-score Positive 0.6983 0.6295 0.6621 Neutral 0.6591 0.8155 0.7290 Negative 0.5592 0.2710 0.3651 Average 0.6652 Table 1: Assessment with TF-IDF weighting scheme Class Precision Recall F1-score positive 0.7037 0.6335 0.6668 neutral 0.6506 0.8313 0.7299 negative 0.5890 0.2105 0.3112 Average 0.6654 Table 2: Assessment with a binary weighting scheme opinions or reviews should be represent</context>

(2002)" startWordPosition="1279" endWordPosition="1282"> several validations on the training set of the task we decided to use unigrams as feature for the polarity classification process. Thus, for the supervised algorithm, we have represented each tweet as a vector of unigrams. The next decision was about the application of a stemmer process and getting rid off the English stop words. We only have applied stemmer process to the data because in previous works (Martinez-C´amara et al., 2013a) we did not reach good results removing the stop words in texts from Twitter. Another topic of discussion in the SA research community is the weighting scheme. Pang et al. (2002) weighted each unigram following a binary scheme. Also, in the most cited survey about SA (Pang and Lee, 2008) the authors indicated that the overall sentiment may not usually be highlighted through repeated use of the same terms. On the other hand, MartinezC´amara et al. (2011) achieved the best results using TF-IDF as weighting scheme. Due to the lack of agreement in the SA research community about the use of a specific weight scheme, we have carried out several assessments with aim of deciding the most suitable one for the task. The machine learning algorithm selected for the evaluation was</context>

Therefore, due to the fact that the binary weighting scheme achieved better results in average, we decided to use it in the final system. The last step in the configuration of a supervised approach based on machine learning is the selection of the algorithm. The algorithm selected was Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). Our decision is based on the widely used SVM by the research community of SA. The first application of SVM for SA was in (Pang et al., 2002) with good results. Since the publication of the previous work, other researchers have used SVM, and some of them are: (Zhang et al., 2009), (Pang and Lee, 2004) and (Jindal and Liu, 2006). Also, the algorithm SVM has been used to classify the polarity over tweets (Go et al., 2009) (Zhang et al., 2011) (Jiang et al., 2011). A broader review of the research about SA in Twitter can be found in (Martinez-C´amara et al., 2013b).

In this paper is described the participation of the SINAI4 research group in the second task of the 2013 edition of the International Workshop SemEval (Wilson et al., 2013). We have submitted two systems (constrained and unconstrained). The constrained system follows a supervised approach, while the unconstrained system is based on an unsupervised approach which used two linguistic resources: the Sentiment Analysis Lexicons (Hu and Liu, 2004) and WeFeelFine6 (Kamvar and Harris, 2011). The paper is organized as follows: first we present a description of the preparing data process. Then the constrained system is outlined. The participation overview finishes with the description of the unconstrained system. 2 Preparing data The organizers provided two sets of data,</context>
