Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999952428571429">
The paper discusses an Information Extraction approach, which is
applied for the automatic processing of hospital Patient Records
(PRs) in Bulgarian language. The main task reported here is
retrieval of status descriptions related to anatomical organs. Due
to the specific telegraphic PR style, the approach is focused on
shallow analysis. Missing text descriptions and default values are
another obstacle. To overcome it, we propose an algorithm for
exploring the correlations between patient status data and the
corresponding diagnosis. Rules for interdependencies of the
patient status data are generated by clustering according to chosen
metrics. In this way it becomes possible to fill in status templates
for each patient when explicit descriptions are unavailable in the
text. The article summarises evaluation results which concern the
performance of the current IE prototype.

Patient data are stored in various formats including paper
archives which are recently transformed to electronic files.
The task of Information Extraction (IE) from patient
records is very important, because it enables automatic
generation of databases with structured patient data that can
be explored for improving the diagnostics, care decisions,
the personalised treatment of diseases as well as other
fields like the healthcare management, epidemiology etc.
On the other hand most of the clinical documents present
only partial information about the patients so some kind of
aggregation is needed to provide a complex view to the
patient health status.
Medical documents contain much unstructured text and
their automatic processing is a challenge to be faced for
every natural language separately. Especially for Bulgarian
language, the biomedical NLP is making its initial steps.
This is partly due to the lack of large corpora in the medical
domain. Our present work deals with anonymous hospital
records of patients who are diagnosed with different forms

of diabetes. The PR pseudonymisation is done by the
information system of the University Specialised Hospital
for Active Treatment of Endocrinology “Acad. I. Penchev”,
which is part of the Medical University – Sofia. The
general objective of our project, to be achieved by 2011, is
to apply IE techniques to patient texts in order to extract
data concerning the hospitalisation effect. Currently we
consider the extraction of patient status data, i.e. the
recognition and structuring of the patient&apos;s symptoms which
are related to diabetes.
Bulgarian medical texts contain a specific mixture of
terminology in Latin, Cyrillic and Latin terms transcribed
with Cyrillic letters. The terms occur in the text with a
variety of wordforms which is typical for the highly-
inflexional Bulgarian language. The major part of the text
consists of sentence phrases without agreement and often
without proper punctuation marks. We consider normalised
texts with standard abbreviations and without spelling
errors, because we aim at a research study. Our present
experimental corpus is formed by some 6400 words, with
some 2000 of them being medical terms.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 overviews
some related research and discusses IE applications in the
medical domain. Section 3 describes the raw data features,
the main types of patient status data and some techniques
for their extraction. Section 4 presents the approach for
aggregation of patient data and calculation of correlations
among different values of patient characteristics. Section 5
sketches the evaluation of the present IE prototype. Section
6 contains the conclusion and some discussions for further
work.

Information Extraction is viewed as a successful language
technology for capturing patient data from unstructured
medical texts. The classical rule-based IE paradigm
involves extraction of entities after shallow analysis,
recognition of references, creation of databases, and filling
templates [1]. The integration of machine-learning

<bodyText confidence="0.997495166666667">
approaches, like e.g. the classification of sentences enables
recognition of patient features with high precision and
recall [2].
Shallow analysis in the IE systems is often based on pattern
matching involving cascading applications of regular
expressions. Some of these patterns are manually produced
and their adaptation to new domain requires much effort.
Other patterns are semi-automatically produced by using
general meta-rules but they are not too precise [3].
IE is applied in various prototypes which are constructed to
perform different extraction tasks from medical documents,
including the following ones:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996428232558139">
• Processing of patient symptoms and diagnosis
treatment data: the system CLEF (Clinical E-Science
Framework) extracts data from clinical records of
cancer patients [4]; AMBIT acquires Medical and
Biomedical Information from Text [5]; MiTAP
(MITRE Text and Audio Processing) monitors
infectious disease outbreaks and other global events
[6]; the system caTIES (Cancer Text Information
Extraction System) processes surgical pathology
reports [7]; the Medical Language Extraction and
Encoding System (MedLEE) was designed for
radiology reports and later extended to other domains
such as discharge summaries [8]. Other systems are
HITEx (Health Information Text Extraction), an open-
source NLP system [9] and cTAKES (clinical Text
Analysis and Knowledge extraction system) [10];
• Building of medical ontologies: IE is applied for
construction of ontology in pneumology in the
PertoMed project. The approach is based on
terminology extraction from texts according to the
differential semantics theory - distributional analysis
and recognition of semantic relationships by lexico-
syntactic patterns [11]. ODIE (Ontology Development
and Information Extraction) is a software toolkit which
codes document sets with ontologies or enriches
existing ontologies with new concepts from the
document set. It contains modules for Named Entity
Recognition, co-reference resolution, concept
discovery, discourse reasoning and attribute value
extraction [12];
• Semi-automatic production of clinical guidelines:
[13] presents the systems EviX (Facilitating Evidence-
based Decision Support Using Information Extraction
and Clinical Guidelines) and LASSIE (modeLing
treAtment proceSSes using Information Extraction)
that apply IE methods to semi-automatically creation
of computer-interpretable clinical guidelines and
modeling treatment processes;
• Creating databases and digital libraries: the
system EMPathIE applies IE for conjunction of online
database from academic journal articles [14]. The
system OntoGene extracts semantic relations between
specific biological entities (such as Genes and
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.909356615384615">
Proteins) from the scientific literature (e.g., PubMed)
[15], and PASTA creates a database of protein active
sites [16].
Unfortunately the presented IE techniques cannot be
directly adapted to our project, because we deal with
documents in Bulgarian and many language-processing
activities start from scratch. For instance, no Named Entity
Recognition has been done for Bulgarian entities in the
medical domain; the regular expressions for shallow
sentence analysis are constructed in the project for the first
time and so on. In this article we present our initial results
in automatic processing of PRs in Bulgarian language using
manually defined patterns.

3. Patient Status Extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956974358974">
The length of PR texts in Bulgarian hospitals is usually 2-3
pages. The document is organised in the following sections:
(i) personal details; (ii) diagnoses of the leading and
accompanying diseases; (iii) anamnesis (personal medical
history), including current complains, past diseases, family
medical history, allergies, risk factors; (iv) patient status,
including results from physical examination; (v) laboratory
and other tests findings; (vi) medical examiners comments;
(vii) discussion; (viii) treatment; (ix) recommendations.
Here we discuss the extraction of patient status data from
free text. The relevant PR section contains mostly short
declarative sentences in present tense which describe the
status of different anatomic organs. At present we do not
consider the values concerning Lab and other tests findings.
Several organs are referred to in the PRs of patients with
diabetes; the text presents the characteristics of 20-30
different anatomic organs and status conditions. The full
description might contain more than 45 different status
observations. The explanation detailness depends on the
status of the corresponding anatomic organs: for some
organs only general characteristics are presented, while
detailed description is given for other organs which are
important for the particular disease. Sometimes organ
descriptions are missing and we assume that there is no
deviation from the normal status; therefore the system
automatically includes certain default values. When an
organ description is located in the text, its phrases and
sentences are analysed by a cascade of regular expressions.
In order to capture the information we use a terminological
bank of medical terms, derived from ICD-10 in Bulgarian
language. The International Classification of Diseases
(ICD-10) contains 10970 terms. The Bulgarian version of
ICD-10 has no clinical extension, i.e. some medical terms
need to be extracted from additional resources like a partial
taxonomy of body parts, a list of medicines etc. We have
compiled a lexicon of medical terminology containing 5288
terms. A lexicon of 30000 Bulgarian lexemes, which is part
of a large general-purpose lexical database with 70000
lexemes, completes the necessary dictionary for
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.993172823529412">
morphological analysis of Bulgarian medical text. Another
helpful resource is the conceptual model of body parts. It
supports the decision how to relate characteristics to
anatomic organs when they are presented in separated
sentences; this partial medical ontology shows the links
between the concepts and points the organs which the
attributes refer to. The ontology also supports the dynamic
generation of templates if the text contains only partial
information about some anatomic organ.
Below we present the typical occurrences of organ
descriptions in the PR texts. Let us denote the Anatomic
Organs by AO (e.g. skin, neck, limbs), their characteristics
(attributes) by Ch (e.g. for skin - colour, hydration, turgor,
elasticity etc.), the attribute values by V (e.g. pale, subicter,
decreased, reduced), and let G stands for the general
explanation of patient status. Then the status-related text
expressions can be grouped into the following categories:

About 96% of all PRs in our training corpus contain organ
descriptions in this format. The more complicated phrases
and sentences are analysed by rules for recognising the
attributes and their values scope. Some PRs lack
descriptions about certain organ attributes. The above-listed
six kinds of text formats are recognised by especially
prepared rules and regular expressions (taking into account
some typical prepositions). The AOs are usually nouns in
basic form and can be identified in the text using the labels
of the medical ontology: e.g. “кожа, щитовидна жлеза,
шия, крайници“ (skin, thyroid gland, neck, limbs). The
main attributes can be also recognised using the medical
terminology lexicon and the medical ontology although
some of them have adjacent modifiers like:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9720994">
• adverbs – which express the degree and stage of
the symptom, like умерено, добре, частично
(moderately, well, partially)
• adjectives:
(i) some of them express details about certain
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.789249636363636">
attributes. For instance, the “skin” characteristic
“hydration” can be presented by a variety of
wordforms: „сух” (dry) and others “възсух, суховат,
...” (slightly dry, rather dry than normal, ...). In other
cases the adjectives express different rates of the
attribute values. For instance the noun phrase
“hypodermic fat tissue” can be modified by adjectives
like “увеличена, леко увеличена, умерено изразена,
добре изразена, редуцирана, силно редуцирана”
(increased, slightly increased, moderately developed,
well developed, reduced, highly reduced).

<bodyText confidence="0.999496785714286">
(ii) other adjectives represent attributes and participate
in the medical terminology lexicon. Sometimes the
PRs contain adjectives which are not typical for the
medical domain. For instance, the attribute &amp;quot;colour&amp;quot; of
the organ &amp;quot;skin&amp;quot;, is usually presented by the adjectives
&amp;quot;бледа, розова, бледо розова, пастьозна, мургава&amp;quot;
(pale, rose, light rose, doughty, swarthy) and non-
typical words like &amp;quot;с пепеляв отенък, бакърена&amp;quot;
(ash-coloured, copper-like). The successful
recognition of these attributes is provided by the large,
representative corpus of patient records and the large
Bulgarian dictionary with general lexica.
To summarise, in our corpus the patient organs and their
features are described in the following way:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.958312">
• General discussion – by giving some default
value, e.g. &amp;quot;с непроменена характеристика за
възрастта&amp;quot; (with unchanged characteristics typical
for the age), &amp;quot;със запазена характеристика&amp;quot; (with
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98919475">
preserved characteristics), &amp;quot;с нормална
характеристика&amp;quot; (with normal characteristics).
General statements happen relatively often, e.g. the
skin status for 26% of the PRs is given by general
explanations. For filling in the obligatory IE template
fields in these cases, we need predefined default values
for the respective organs status. This issue is further
discussed below;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999296576923077">
• Explicit statements – the PR text contains specific
values. The attribute name might be missing since the
reference to the organ is sufficient: e.g. &amp;quot;pale skin&amp;quot;
instead of &amp;quot;skin with pale colour&amp;quot;. The attributes are
described by a variety of expressions, e.g. for the
&amp;quot;volume of the thyroid gland” the value &amp;quot;нормална&amp;quot;
(normal) can be expressed as &amp;quot;неувеличена, не се
палпира увеличена, не се палпира&amp;quot; (not enlarged, not
palpated enlarged, not palpated). There are several
characteristics (about 15% of all attributes) that have
numerical values like &amp;quot;АН в легнало положение
150/110 mmHg, изправено положение 110/90
mmHg.&amp;quot; (BP 150/110 mmHg in lying position, 110/90
mmHg in standing position).
• Partial explanations – the text contains
descriptions about organ parts, not for the whole
anatomic organ. For instance, the skin status can be
expressed by phrases like &amp;quot;дифузно зачервяване на
лицето&amp;quot; (diffuse redness of the face). In this case we
need some knowledge about the body parts to infer that
face skin is part of the whole skin. Additional fields are
added to the obligatory fields of the IE template;
• By diagnosis – sometimes a diagnosis is given
instead of organ description, e.g. &amp;quot;Затлъстяване от
първа степен&amp;quot; (First degree of obesity) or
&amp;quot;онихомикоза&amp;quot; (onychomicosis).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999861428571429">
It is challenging to extract the patient status description
directly from the PRs as it is often not recorded in the
patient&apos;s clinical notes. Figure 1 presents the percentage of
PR texts which discuss five skin characteristics. About 20%
of the PRs in our corpus report observations of other skin
attributes which are not included in Fig. 1. Much
information in the PR text is implicit.

Our approach for negation treatment is based on shallow
processing (chunking only) in combination with deep
semantic analysis in certain points [17]. The choice of
proper templates for recognition and interpretation of the
negation influences considerably the system performance.
For example we can recognize phrases like:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.726509333333333">
&amp;quot;без шумова находка&amp;quot; (without thrill finding)
&amp;quot;няма патологичи промени&amp;quot; (no pathological changes)
&amp;quot;отсъстват хрипове&amp;quot; (absent rales)
&amp;quot;липсват отоци и варикозни промени&amp;quot; (missing edema
or varicose changes)

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999577818181818">
In general, the shallow text analysis using regular
expressions helps to identify the necessary sentence phrases
but the decision for filling in a template is often difficult.
Fig. 2/left shows the default template of “skin” with its four
obligatory characteristics. A general sentence might occur
in the text, line “skin with normal characteristic”, and the
IE module has to fill in the default values. Fig. 2/right
contains a partially-filled template for a PR containing the
sentence “skin - pale, dry, with decreased turgor and
elasticity”. Therefore, we need to invent some methods to
‘calculate’ the missing status values, using the default
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995024">

<bodyText confidence="0.999620285714286">
values and reasoning rules. In addition we notice that the
values for turgor and elasticity are not quite independent,
so the reasoning rules should be based on certain statistical
observations regarding the values&apos; interdependencies.
To study the correlation of values for different organ
attributes, the medical experts in the project have
developed a scale of normal, worse and bаd conditions.
Some words from the PRs are chosen as representative for
the corresponding status scale and the other text
expressions are automatically classified into these typical
status grades. Table 1 illustrates the scales for skin and
gives examples for words signaling the respective status. In
fact the regular expressions for shallow analysis map the
explicit text descriptions about skin into the chosen
categories. In this way all word expressions are turned into
numeric values and it becomes possible to study the
deviations from the normal condition. The mapping process
is not trivial and requires precise elaboration of the regular
expressions. Some 95 skin colour characteristics exist in
the medical domain, although our present corpus contains
less and they all have to be treated by corresponding rules.

In order to explore the correlations in Fig. 3 we need to
analyse the repeated observations on patient status data.
Applying standard techniques like Canonical Correlation
Analysis and Multiple Regression Analysis is a time and
efforts consuming task [18]. Instead of analysing all
possible combinations and permutations of values of all
characteristics of all anatomic organs, we try to analyse
only possible and consistent combinations of values and
explore their correlations.
Patient status texts explain not only the current disease;
they rather present a complex view which is influenced by
all patients’ current and previous diseases. That is why it is
too difficult to generate the aggregated patient status for a
particular disease. First we need to study statistical data
about the patient status for each disease. Then we have to
select the most typical data and characteristics. For instance
if we deal with a disease D1 we need to explore with high
priority the data for patients which have only D1, but we
have to take in consideration also patients with more
complex diseases like D1&amp;D2, D1&amp;D3, D1&amp;D2&amp;D3 etc.
There are also sets of diseases that cannot happen together
at the same moment, e.g. Diabetes - type 1, Diabetes - type
2, and Diabetes - type 3. Even for patients who have only
some disease D1 the aggregation results are not clear
because their status can be influenced from previous
diseases which are not mentioned in the present PR texts.
In order to avoid inconsistent combinations of diseases we
explore only those presented in our corpus.
Below we sketch a data aggregation algorithm which we
explore at present in order to complete the picture of patient
status data and fill in a special kind of dynamic IE
templates. Please note that there could be several PR texts
for different visits of the same patient at the hospital.
Algorithm: Let P={p1, p2, ...., pk}
be the training set of patients (i.e.
text describing patient status data).
Step 1: For each patient pj∈P,
j=1,..,n find in the PR text the set qj
of the corresponding diseases of pj
(the mapping is shown at Fig. 4).

Step 2: From the set Q = {q1, q2, ...., qk } find D={D1, ...,
Dn} of all diseases for the patients in P;
Step 3: Cluster Q into m classes of equivalence
T={T1,T2,...,Tm} where the class Ti={qj  |qj∈Q and qj = qi };
Step 4: Cluster P into m sets S = {S1, S2, ..., Sm} where
Si={pj  |pj∈P and qj ∈ Ti };
Step 5: For each set Si, each anatomic organ and each of its
characteristics, calculate the statistical distribution of the
attributes among the patients with the class of diagnosis Ti
only and compute the most expected (most probable) value
of each characteristic. Let us denote it by APDi
(Aggregated Patient Data for the class of diseases Ti).
Step 6: Find S(1) for patients whose diagnosis differ in
exactly one disease (one more or less, but have at least one
common disease ) S(1)i={Sj  |Sj ∈S : |qj \ qi|+|qi \ qj|=1 }
1≤i≤n, S(2) i=={Sj |Sj ∈S : |qj \ qi|+|qi \ qj|=2} 1≤i≤n for
patients which diagnosis differ in exactly two diseases etc.
(See Fig. 5).
Step 7: Refine results for each APDi by using data from
S(1), S(2), ..., S(n). This refinement is done by including
patient data from S(1), S(2), ..., S(n). For each set S(m), its
APDi is calculated separately for the patients having Ti.
Different decreasing weights (w1,w2,...,wn) are assigned to
the APDi values for the sets in S(1), S(2), ..., S(n) .

Using the aggregated personal data, we can define
templates for each disease and its possible combinations
with other diseases. There will be more expected
characteristics of the anatomic organs – those with
probabilities higher than a predefined threshold. Not all
combinations of values are consistent and due to this reason
we cannot mark directly the default values.
The next step is to produce rules for more possible
consistent values for the IE templates. First we rank
characteristics according to their number of occurences in
the patient status. Then for every possible value of the
characteristics, occurring more often, the rest of
characteristics values are ranked. The obtained rules will be
used for improvement of the generated templates and their
obligatory fields with expected values.
This approach for generation of &apos;intelligent dynamic
templates&apos; is under development at present. The objective is
to have dynamic templates for each disease, where the
expected obligatory fields and their default values can
change depending on the information which is filled in for
the corpus of PRs in the particular hospital.

5. Evaluation Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986285714286">
We have evaluated the text analysis and the recognition of
the basic status scales for the skin attributes (partly
explicated in the text as shown in Table 1). In fact our
approach has the same objectives like the one presented in
[2], where the patient smoking status is classified into 5
categories by selecting sentences which contain the
relevant information. As stated above, the negated
descriptions are treated as one expression, following a
previous study of negative forms in Bulgarian medical
patient texts [17].
We have evaluated the extraction progress using a corpus
of 197 PRs as a training set and another 43 PR as a test set.
The evaluation is done organ by organ since their
description in the text are separated and can be analysed
independently. There are few PRs without any description
of the organ status but they are removed by the evaluation
figures.
The first row of Table 2 shows the percentage of correctly
recognised attribute descriptions for three anatomic organs:
skin, thyroid gland and limbs. The second row of Table 2
shows the percentage of correctly processed PRs.

<tableCaption confidence="0.964856">
Table 2. Percentage of correctly extracted status attributes
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.84018575">
The cases of incorrect extraction are due to more complex
sentence structures in the PR text which need to be
processed by a deeper syntactic analyser. For example:
&amp;quot;Кожа бледа с папулозен обрив по главата, гърдите и
гърба, най-вероятно обусловен от калциеви отлагания
в меките тъкани. &amp;quot;
(Pale skin with papular rash on the head, chest and back,
most likely caused by calcium precipitation in soft tissues.)

<bodyText confidence="0.9965513">
Table 2 shows that the simple regular expressions work
relatively well and produce enough input for statistical
observations and aggregations of patient status data. It is
also clear that we need more data to properly develop the
algorithms for production of dynamic templates. Currently
we have one base template for each anatomic organ; its
possible variations depends on the size of the medical
ontology branch concerning this anatomic organ. In more
complicated cases variations can increase up to 218
.

6. Present Results and Further Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955117647059">
The article presents on-going work for extraction of patient
status data from PR text. In this initial stage we have
considered only some relations in the patient’s clinical
notes. Steps for generation of dynamic templates are
sketched. Our present efforts are focused on morpho-
syntactic annotation of full sentences in order to train a
statistical parser on Bulgarian medical documents.
Unfortunately no Named Entity Recognition component is
available for Bulgarian, so we have to consider its
development too. As further work for negated phrases we
plan to refine the chunking algorithm, to enlarge the
number of templates and to expand the language and
knowledge resources of the system (lexicon, ontology etc.).
In a long run we plan to develop algorithms for discovering
more complex relations and other dependences that are not
explicitly given in the text, but this is a target for the future
project stages.

<abstract confidence="0.9999044">The paper discusses an Information Extraction approach, which is applied for the automatic processing of hospital Patient Records (PRs) in Bulgarian language. The main task reported here is retrieval of status descriptions related to anatomical organs. Due to the specific telegraphic PR style, the approach is focused on shallow analysis. Missing text descriptions and default values are another obstacle. To overcome it, we propose an algorithm for exploring the correlations between patient status data and the corresponding diagnosis. Rules for interdependencies of the patient status data are generated by clustering according to chosen metrics. In this way it becomes possible to fill in status templates for each patient when explicit descriptions are unavailable in the text. The article summarises evaluation results which concern the performance of the current IE prototype.</abstract>

Figure 1 presents the percentage of PR texts which discuss five skin characteristics. About 20% of the PRs in our corpus report observations of other skin attributes which are not included in Fig. 1. Much information in the PR text is implicit. Figure 1. Percentage of PRs with explicit statements about skin status Our approach for negation treatment is based on shallow processing (chunking only) in combination with deep semantic analysis in certain points [17]. The choice of proper templates for recognition and interpretation of the negation influences considerably the system performance. For example we can recognize phrases like: &amp;quot;без шумова находка&amp;quot; (without thrill finding) &amp;quot;няма патологичи промени&amp;quot; (no pathological changes) &amp;quot;отсъстват хрипове&amp;quot; (absent rales) &amp;quot;липсват отоци и варикозни промени&amp;quot; (missing edema or varicose changes) Figure 2.

Evaluation Results and Discussion We have evaluated the text analysis and the recognition of the basic status scales for the skin attributes (partly explicated in the text as shown in Table 1). In fact our approach has the same objectives like the one presented in [2], where the patient smoking status is classified into 5 categories by selecting sentences which contain the relevant information. As stated above, the negated descriptions are treated as one expression, following a previous study of negative forms in Bulgarian medical patient texts [17]. We have evaluated the extraction progress using a corpus of 197 PRs as a training set and another 43 PR as a test set. The evaluation is done organ by organ since their description in the text are separated and can be analysed independently. There are few PRs without any description of the organ status but they are removed by the evaluation figures. The first row of Table 2 shows the percentage of correctly recognised attribute descriptions for three anatomic organs: skin, thyroid gland and limbs. The second row of Table 2 shows the percentage of correctly processed PRs. Table 2. Percentage </context>

Each column corresponds to one patient; the values marked there signal the presence of text description in the PR which explains the skin status. We notice that the turgor and elasticity are usually discussed together. 4. Aggregated Patient Data vs Individual Patient Data In order to explore the correlations in Fig. 3 we need to analyse the repeated observations on patient status data. Applying standard techniques like Canonical Correlation Analysis and Multiple Regression Analysis is a time and efforts consuming task [18]. Instead of analysing all possible combinations and permutations of values of all characteristics of all anatomic organs, we try to analyse only possible and consistent combinations of values and explore their correlations. Patient status texts explain not only the current disease; they rather present a complex view which is influenced by all patients’ current and previous diseases. That is why it is too difficult to generate the aggregated patient status for a particular disease. First we need to study statistical data about the patient status for each disease. Then we have to select the mos</context>
