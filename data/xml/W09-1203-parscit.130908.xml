In this paper we present a system submitted to the
CoNLL Shared Task 2009 performing the identifi-
cation and labeling of syntactic and semantic depen-
dencies in multiple languages. Dependencies are
truly jointly learned, i.e. as if they were a single
task. The system works in two phases: a classifica-
tion phase in which three classifiers predict different
types of information, and a ranking phase in which
the output of the classifiers is combined.

<bodyText confidence="0.9995931">
In this paper we present the machine learning system
submitted to the CoNLL Shared Task 2009 (Hajiˇc
et al., 2009). The task is an extension to multi-
ple languages (Burchardt et al., 2006; Hajiˇc et al.,
2006; Kawahara et al., 2002; Palmer and Xue, 2009;
Surdeanu et al., 2008; Taul´e et al., 2008) of the
CoNLL Shared Task 2008, combining the identifica-
tion and labeling of syntactic dependencies and se-
mantic roles. Our system is a joint-learning system
tested in the “closed” challenge, i.e. without making
use of external resources.
Our system operates in two phases: a classifica-
tion phase in which three memory-based classifiers
predict different types of information, and a rank-
ing phase in which the output of the classifiers is
combined by ranking the predictions. Semantic and
syntactic dependencies are jointly learned and pro-
cessed. In the task description no precise defini-
tion is given of joint learning. We consider that a
joint-learning system is one in which semantic and
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999954925925926">
syntactic dependencies are learned and processed
jointly as a single task. In our system this is achieved
by fully merging semantic and syntactic dependen-
cies at the word level as the first step.
One direct consequence of merging the two tasks,
is that the class space becomes more complex;
the number of classes increases. Many machine-
learning approaches do not scale well to larger class
spaces in terms of efficiency and computer resource
requirements. Memory-based learning is a noted ex-
ception, as it is largely insensitive to the number of
classes in terms of efficiency. This is the primary
reason for using memory-based learning. Memory-
based language processing (Daelemans and van den
Bosch, 2005) is based on the idea that NLP prob-
lems can be solved by storing solved examples of the
problem in their literal form in memory, and apply-
ing similarity-based reasoning on these examples in
order to solve new ones. Memory-based algorithms
have been previously applied to semantic role la-
beling and parsing separately (Morante et al., 2008;
Canisius and Tjong Kim Sang, 2007).
We briefly discuss the issue of true joint learning
of two tasks in Section 2. The system is described
in Section 3, Section 4 presents and discusses the
results, and in Section 5 we put forward some con-
clusions and future research.

When two tasks share the same feature space, there
is the natural option to merge them and consider the
merge as a single task. The merging of two tasks
will typically lead to an increase in the number of
classes, and generally a more complex class space.
In practice, if two combined tasks are to some ex-

tent related, the increase will tend to be less than the
product of the number of classes in the two original
tasks, as classes from both tasks will tend to cor-
relate. Yet, even a mild increase of the number of
classes leads to a further fragmentation of the class
space, and thus to less training examples per class
label. Joint learning can therefore only lead to posi-
tive results if the data sparsity effect of the fragmen-
tation of the class space is counter-balanced by an
improved learnability.
Here, we treat the syntactic and semantic tasks as
one and the same task. At the word level, we merge
the class labels of the two tasks into single labels,
and present the classifiers with these labels. Further
on in our system, as we describe in the next sec-
tion, we do make use of the compositionality of the
labels, as the semantic and syntactic output spaces
represented two different types of structure.

The joint system that we submitted works in
two phases: a classification phase in which three
memory-based classifiers predict different aspects of
joint syntactic and semantic labeling, and a ranking
phase in which the output of the classifiers is com-
bined. Additionally, a memory-based classifier is
used for predicate sense disambiguation. As a first
step, before generating the instances of the classi-
fiers we merge the semantic and syntactic dependen-
cies into single labels. The merged version of the
dependencies from an example sentence is shown
in Table 1, where column MERGED DEPs contains
all the dependencies of a token separated by a blank

In the classification phase, three classifiers predict
different local aspects of the global output structure.
The classifiers have been optimized for English, by
training on the full training set and testing on the
development set; these optimized settings were then
used for the other six languages. We experimented
with manually selected parameters and with param-
eters selected by a genetic algorithm, but the param-
eters found by the genetic algorithm did not yield
better results than the manually selected parameters.

ing modified value difference as the similarity met-
ric, gain ratio for feature weighting, using 11 k-
nearest neighbors, and weighting the class vote of
neighbors as a function of their inverse linear dis-
tance. Because of time limitations we used TRIBL
for Czech and Chinese to produce the official results,
although we also provide postevaluation results pro-
duced with IB1. TRIBL is a hybrid combination
of IB1 and IGTREE, a fast decision-tree approxi-
mation of k-NN (Daelemans and van den Bosch,
2005), trading off fast decision-tree lookup on the
most important features (in our experiments, five)
with slower k-NN classification on the remaining
features.

merged semantic and syntactic dependencies that
hold between two tokens (PDEPREL:APRED la-
bels). If this classifier would be able to predict the
dependencies with 100% accuracy, no further pro-
cessing would be necessary. Naturally, however, the
classifier predicts incorrect dependencies to a certain
degree, and does not provide a graph in wich all to-
kens have at least a syntactic head. It achieves 51.3%
labeled macro F1. The ranking phase improves this
performance. This is done in three steps: (i) ranking
the predictions of Classifier 1; (ii) constructing an
intermediate dependency tree, and (iii) adding extra
semantic dependencies to the tree.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.911988">
3.2.1 Ranking predictions of Classifier 1
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930352941176">
In order to disambiguate between all possible de-
pendencies predicted by this classifier, the system
applies ranking rules. It analyses the dependency
relations that have been predicted for a token with
its potential parents in the sentence and ranks them.
For example, for a sentence with 10 tokens, the sys-
tem would make 10 predictions per token. The pre-
dictions are first ranked by entropy of the class dis-
tribution for that prediction, then using the output of
Classifier 2, and next using the output of Classifier 3.
Ranking by entropy In order to compute entropy
we use the (inverse-linear) distance-weighted class
label distributions among the nearest neighbors that
Classifier 1 was able to find. For example, the pre-
diction for an instance can be: { NONE (2.74),
NMOD: (0.48) }. We can compute the entropy for
this instance using the formula in (1):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.91418225">
n
− P(labelZ)log2(P(labelZ)) (1)
Z=1
with

<bodyText confidence="0.923868083333333">
- n: the total number of different labels in the distri-
bution, and
- P label &apos; the weight of label i
( a )&apos; the total sum of the weights in the distribution
The system ranks the prediction with the lowest
entropy in position 1, while the prediction with the
highest entropy is ranked in the last position. The
rationale behind this is that the lower the entropy,
the more certain the classifier is about the predicted
dependency. Table 4 lists the first six heads for the
predicate word ‘starts’ ranked by entropy (cf. Ta-
ble 1).

performed by using the predictions of Classifier 2,
i.e. the estimated labels of the dependency rela-

Because this is done after ranking by entropy, the
instances with the lowest entropy are still at the top
of the list. Table 5 displays the re-ranked six heads
of ‘starts’, given that Classifier 2 has predicted that
possible relations to heads are SBJ:A1 and :A1, and
given that only ‘expected’ is associated with one of
these two relations.

this rule induces a 9.0% error reduction on labeled

makes use of Classifier 3, which predicts the rela-
tion that holds between two tokens. The dependency

3.2.2 Construction of the intermediate
dependency tree
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998544">
After ranking the predictions of Classifier 1, the
system selects a syntactic head for every token. This
is motivated by the fact that every token has one and
only one syntactic head. The system selects the pre-
diction with the best ranking that has in the PDE-
PREL part a value different than “ ”.
The intermediate tree can have more than one root
or no root at all. To make sure that every sentence
has one and only one root we apply some extra rules.
If the sentence does not have a token with a root la-
bel, the system checks the distributions of Classi-
fier 1. The token with the rootlabel in its distribution
that is the head of the biggest number of tokens is
taken as root. If the intermediate tree has more than
one root, the last root is taken as root. The other root
tokens get the label with a syntax part (PDEPREL)
that has the highest score in the distribution of Clas-
sifier 1.
The product of this step is a tree in which ev-
ery token is uniquely linked to a syntactic head.
Because syntactic and semantic dependencies have
been linked, the tree contains also semantic depen-
dencies. However, the tree is missing the purely se-
mantic dependencies. The next step adds these rela-
tions to the dependency tree.

In order to find the tokens that have only a seman-

each predicate (i.e. tokens marked with Y in FILL-

and selects the predictions in which the PDEPREL
part of the label is “ ” and the APRED part of the
label is different than “ ”. On the development data
for English, applying this rule produces a 6.7% er-

5 Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.999568166666667">
In this paper we presented the system that we sub-
mitted to the “closed” challenge of the CoNLL
Shared Task 2009. We observe fairly low scores,
which can be possibly improved for all languages by
making use of the available morpho-syntactic fea-
tures, which we did not use in the present system,
by optimising the classifiers per language, and by
improving the reranking algorithm. We also ob-
serve a relatively low recall on the semantic task as
compared to overall recall, indicating that syntactic
dependencies are identified with a better precision-
recall balance. A logical continuation of this study
is to compare joint learning to learning syntactic and
semantic dependencies in isolation, using the same
architecture. Only then will we be able to put for-
ward conclusions about the performance of a joint
learning system versus the performance of a system
that learns syntax and semantics independently.
