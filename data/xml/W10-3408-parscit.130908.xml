<bodyText confidence="0.999967">
This paper is based on our efforts on
automatic multi-word terms extraction
and its conceptual structure for multi-
ple languages. At present, we mainly
focus on English and the major Ro-
mance languages such as French, Span-
ish, Portuguese, and Italian. This pa-
per is a case study for Italian language.
We present how to build automatically
conceptual structure of automatically ex-
tracted multi-word terms from domain
specific corpora for Italian. We show
the experimental results for extracting
multi-word terms from two domain cor-
pora (“natural area” and “organic agri-
culture”). Since this work is still on-
going, we discuss our future direction at
the end of the paper.

<bodyText confidence="0.999986431372549">
Great progress has been recently obtained on us-
ing text analysis to extract terms in a specific
field. The study of texts helps in finding and or-
ganizing textual segments representing concep-
tual units. A corpus is a collection of texts stored
in an electronic database. Texts have been se-
lected to be representative of a particular goal.
A corpus must be balanced in quality and quan-
tity contents: in order to be representative of a
domain, texts have to cover all the possible com-
municative situations. Generally, in a specialised
domain, users share contents and they normally
can understand and communicate with each oth-
ers without ambiguities. However, when differ-
ent communities get in touch the possibility of
misunderstanding arises because of terminolog-
ical variation. This variation can be detected at
a conceptual level or at the formal one. Our ap-
proach tries to overcome this problem by collect-
ing different text typologies. Texts may be ex-
tracted from different sources which can be clas-
sified as their specialisation level, their contents,
their pragmatic application, etc. In our case, we
are interested in using different texts, in order to
analysis the result of automatic extraction in dif-
ferent communicative situations to improve its
functioning.
A term can be simple if composed by one
word, or complex if composed by several words.
This paper focuses on extracting and concep-
tually structuring multi-word terms for Italian.
Collet (2000) affirmed that a complex term
(multi-word term in our terminology) is a com-
plex unit whose components are separated by a
space and are syntactically connected. The re-
sulting unit denominates a concept which be-
longs to the language for special purposes (LSP).
Texts on any domain are easily available on the
Web these days. To create a corpus represent-
ing a field, materials should be, however anal-
ysed and re-elaborated in order to resolve even-
tual problems arising the transfer of data. In
particular, a corpus have to be processed in or-
der to classify the composing units. This clas-
sification represents the first step towards termi-
nological extraction. Terminologists must often
look through many texts before finding appropri-
ate ones (Agbago and Barrire, 2005). L’Homme
(2004) presents guidelines for choosing termi-
nology such as domain specificity, language
originality, specialization level, type, date, data

evaluation.1
Since interaction between domains increases
consistently, domain specificity is a crucial point
to considerer during the creation of a corpus.
Text typologies and communicative situations
reflect their peculiarity to terms. A concept can
be represented differently if the level of special-
isation of a text or the context changes. Here,
we consider the context as the frame in which
the communication takes place. For example,
the domain of “natural area”, Italian language is
really interesting because terms register a high
level of variations due to the different contexts.
The LSP changes as the society evolves.
Terms can register the diachronic variation due
to the development of a certain domain. The
evolution of a domain influences also the termi-
nologies which form LSP. Terminological evolu-
tion generates variations in the conceptual rep-
resentation which should be observed in order
to detect terms and their variants and to estab-
lish relations between them. For example, the
domain of “organic agriculture” is now evolving
and changing because of political choices. This
affects the terminology and the eventual creation
of new forms. The affix bio- which can be use
as a variant of almost all multi-word terms con-
cerning the biological production such as metodo
di produzione biologica (‘method of organic pro-
duction’) becomes metodo bio and prodotto bio-
logico (‘organic product’) becomes prodotto bio
or just bio.
In this paper, we present an approach for ex-
tracting automatically multi-word terms (MWT)
from domain specific corpora for Italian. We
also try to conceptually structure them, that is we
build the ’conceptual’ structure of variations of
multi-word terms where we can learn dynamics
of terms (Daille, 2002). Conceptual structure in
this paper limits to the semantic relationships be-
tween terms such as Hyperonomy, Antony, Set
of, and Result between multi-word terms and we
currently implement only hyperonomy relations.
Actually, this paper is based on our efforts
on automatic multi-word terms extraction and its
conceptual structure for multiple languages. At
present, we mainly focus on English and the ma-
jor Romance languages such as French, Span-
ish, Portuguese, and Italian. This paper is a case
study for Italian language. The remaining of this
paper is organized as follows: We explain how
to automatically extract and conceptually struc-
ture multi-word terms from domain specific cor-
pora in the next section. We also describe some
implementation issues and current advancement.
Since this work is still on-going, we discuss our
future direction in the last section.

2.1 ACABIT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999283">
To extract automatically multi-word terms from
domain specific corpora and conceptually struc-
ture them for Italian, we adapt existing ACABIT
which is a general purpose term extractor. It
takes as input a linguistically annotated corpus
and proposes as output a list of multi-word term
candidates ranked from the most representative
of the corpus to the least using the log-likelihood
estimation.2 ACABIT is currently available for
English and French as different programs for
each language. Fundamentally, ACABIT works
as two stages: stat and tri. At the stat,
it allows us to identify multi-word terms in cor-
pora to calculate the statistic. At the tri, it al-
lows us to sort and conceptually structure them
based on base terms. For the moment, we reim-
plement universal stat for major Romance lan-
guages. We explain the more detailed issues of
our reimplementation of ACABIT for Italian in
Section 2.3.

2.2 Base Term and its Variations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999825">
For automatic multi-word term identification, it
is necessary to define first the syntactic struc-
tures which are potentially lexicalisable (Daille,
2003). We refer to these complex sequences as
base terms. For Italian, the syntactic structure of
base terms is as follows (where Nouni is a head):

Noun1 Adj area protetta (‘protected area’),
azienda agricola (‘agricultural company’)
Noun1 Noun2 zona tampone (‘buffer area’)
Noun1 di (Det) Noun2 sistema di controllo
(‘control system’), conservazione dei
biotopi (‘biotope conservation’)
Besides these base term structures, there is
also [Noun1 a` VZ,,,f] for example for French. For
Italian, there might be [Noun1 da VZ,,,f] such as
prodotto biologico da esportare (‘organic prod-
uct to export’) which is rather phraseology and
not a term. Consequently, we define only three
base term structures for Italian for now.
ACABIT for Italian should spot variations of
base terms and puts them together. For exam-
ple, there are graphical variations such as case
differences and the presence of an optional hy-
phen inside of base term structures, inflexional
variations where aree protette (‘protected ar-
eas’) should be considered as the variation of
area protetta (‘protected area’), or shallow syn-
tactic variations which only modifies function
words of the base terms, such as optional charac-
ter of the preposition and article such as sistema
di informazione and sistema informativo (‘infor-
mation system’).
To conceptually structure identified multi-
word terms, ACABIT for Italian should put to-
gether syntactic variations which modify the in-
ternal structure of the base term: internal mod-
ification and coordination. Internal modifica-
tion variations introduce the modifier such as
the adjective in [Noun1 di Noun2] structure or
a nominal specifier inside of [Noun1 Adj] struc-
ture. For example, qualit`a ambientale (‘envi-
ronmental quality’) and elevata qualit`a ambien-
tale (‘high environmental quality’) for [Noun1 di
Noun2] structure and ingrediente biologico (‘or-
ganic ingredient’) and ingrediente d’origine bi-
ologico (‘organic origin ingredient’) for [Noun1
Adj] structure . Coordination variations coordi-
nate or enumerate the base term structure, for
example habitat ntaurali (‘natural habitat’) and
habitat naturali e quasi naturali (‘natural and al-
most natural habitat’)

2.3 Implementation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887777777777">
To keep consistent with the original ACABIT and
to take an advantage of by directly using a certain
part of existing modules, we use the input and the
output formats of ACABIT. The input format of
ACABIT requires the lemmatized forms of words
for detecting inflexional variations of multi-word
terms. For example, putting together inflexional
variations such as area protetta and aree protette
(‘protected area(s)’) is easily predictable by us-
ing their lemmatized forms. The original ver-
sion of ACABIT for French uses BRILL’s POS
tagger3 for POS tagging and FLEMM4 for restor-
ing morpho-syntactic information and lemma-
tized forms. And for English, it uses BRILL’s
POS tagger and CELEX lexical database5 as a
lemmatiser.
Since we are reimplementing ACABIT for
multiple languages and we want to use the ho-
mogeneous preprocessing for ACABIT, we use
TREETAGGER6 which annotates both of part-of-
speech tags and lemma information as prepro-
cessor for . Moreover, TREETAGGER is avail-
able for several languages. We, then adapt the
result of TREETAGGER for the input format for
ACABIT. We use French POS tagger’s tagset
(´Etiquettes de Brill94 Franc¸ais INALF/CNRS)
for every language, we convert TREETAGGER
tagset into BRILL’s tagset.7
Figure 1 shows the example of the input for-
mat of ACABIT in XML makes use of which
conforms to Document Type Definition (DTD)
in Figure 2. In Figure 1, POS tags are followed
by morpho-syntactic information and the lem-
matized form of a token in each &lt;PH&gt;.8 TREE-

morphological features such as gender, number,
person and case as FLEMM in the previous ver-
sion of ACABIT. We simply introduce dummy
morphological information because it is not ac-
tually used in ACABIT. Note that `e/SYM/`e in
Figure 1 is not correctly POS-tagged by TREE-
TAGGER. It is one of flexional forms of essere
(‘be’) instead of the symbol (SYM). However, we
do not perform any post-processing to correct er-
rors and we leave it as it is analyzed for the mo-
ment.
In Figure 2, &lt;CORPUS&gt; is for the name of
the corpus, &lt;RECORD&gt; is for different texts
which are usually from separate files, &lt;INFO&gt;
has a format like &lt;INFO&gt;00/CAR/00 -/-
0001800/SBC/0001800&lt;/INFO&gt; with the
year of text creation 00 and the file identifica-
tion 0001800. &lt;TITLE&gt; is for the title, &lt;AB&gt;
is for the text body, and &lt;PH NB=&amp;quot;num&amp;quot;&gt; is for
sentence identification.
ACABIT proposes as output a list of multi-
word terms ranked from the most representa-
tive of the corpus using log-likelihood estima-
tion (Dunning, 1993) and their variations in the
corpus. It also shows the semantic relation be-
tween multi-word terms. The example of the
output is given in Figure 3. A base term, for
example area protetto (‘protected area’) is put
together with its syntactic variations “area nat-
urale protetto (‘natural protected area’) and area
marino protetto (‘marine protected area’). We
can rewrite them as Hyperonomy (area natu-
rale protetto) = area protetto” or Hyperonomy
(area marino protetto) = area protetto because
ACABIT identifies that area protetto is a hyper-
nym of area naturale protetto and area marino
protetto as &lt;MODIF&gt;ied terms of &lt;BASE&gt;
terms . Likewise, a base term prodotto bio-
logico (‘organic product’) has its syntactic varia-
tion: internal modification such as prodotto non
biologico (‘non-organic product’), prodotto ali-
mentare non biologico (‘non-organic alimentary
product’), and prodotto ittico biologico (‘organic
fishing product’), and coordination like prodotto
biologico e non biologico (‘organic and non-
organic product’). Moreover, there are Antonym
relation described as LINK type=&amp;quot;Neg&amp;quot; be-
tween the base terms and some of its syntactic
variations such as prodotto non biologico and
prodotto alimentare non biologico. Note that
output of ACABIT in Figure 3 only contains
canonical forms of multi-word terms.

2.4 Experiments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999752055555555">
Creation of domain specific corpora: For our
experiments we crawl two domain corpora of
“natural area” domain which consists of 17,291
sentences and 543,790 tokens from Gli E-
Quaderni9 and 47,887 sentences and 1,857,914
tokens from Parchi10. We also crawl in the Inter-
net to create the corpus of “organic agriculture”
which consists of 5,553 sentences and 150,246
tokens from National legislations and European
legislations for organic agriculture11.
Automatic evaluation: Table 1 shows the statis-
tics of experimental results from each domain.
Since our domain corpora are mutually related,
we count the common multi-word terms and
there are 600 unique terms (base terms + vari-
ations) shared in both corpora. This is 18.74%
of the number of terms in “organic agriculture”.
Figure 4 shows example of these common terms.

Till now, we reimplement only stat for multi-
ple languages. To conceptually struture them, we
still borrow tri of the previous ACABIT. We
have not implemented yet full features of stat
for Italian neither because of the lack of morpho-
syntactic rules.
For example, the preposition inside of the term
of [Noun1 di Noun2] structure might be equiva-
lent to a prefix-added Noun2 such as deteriora-
mento dopo la raccolta (‘rot after harvest’) vs.
deterioramento post-raccolta (‘post-harvesting

In general, manual retrieval and validation of
terms is labor intensive and time consuming.
The automatic or semi-automatic methods which
works on text in order to detect single or multi-
word terms relevant to a subject field is referred
to as term extraction. Term extraction produces
the raw material for terminology databases. It
is a process which is likely to produce signifi-
cant benefits in terms individuation. The reasons
which justify term extractions are:

Term extraction systems are usually catego-

sented by the linguistically-based or rule-based
approaches use linguistic information such as
POS and chunk information to detect stop words
and to select candidate terms to predefined syn-
tactic patterns. The second group is represented
by the statistical corpus-based approaches se-
lect n-gram sequences as candidate terms. The
terms are selected by applying statistical mea-
sures. Recently, these two approach are com-
bined.
We implement ACABIT for Italian, which
uses the combined method to extract multi-word
terms and structure them automatically. We in-
troduce base term structures and their linguistic
variation such as graphical, inflexional, and shal-
low syntactic variations. We also consider the
modification of the structure of base terms such
as internal modification using adjective and co-
ordinate variations. We evaluate on two domain
specific corpora mutually related “natural area”
and “organic agriculture” to extract multi-words
terms and we find 600 unique terms shared in
both copora. This paper is based on our efforts
on automatic multi-word terms extraction and its
conceptual structure for multiple languages and
this is a case study for Italian language. For
the moment, we reimplement universal stat for
major Romance languages. Most of previous
work on extracting terms, especially for multiple
languages are focusing on single-word terms and
they are also often based on statistical approach
with simple morphological patterns, for exam-
ple Bernhard (2006), and Velupillai and Dalianis
(2008).

Since this work is still on-going, we con-
sider only Hyperonomy relations as the con-
ceptual relation where a relative adjective mod-
ifies inside of the base term with [Nouns Adj]
or [Nouns di Noun2] structures. We also con-
sider Antonym only with negative adverbs like
non. There are still Antonym (e.g. solubilit`a
micellare (‘micellar solubilization’) vs. insolu-
bilit`a micellare (‘micellar insolubilisation’)), Set
of (e.g. piuma d’anatra (‘duck feather’) vs. pi-
umaggio dell’anatra (‘duck feathers’)), Result
(e.g. filettaggio del salmone (‘salmon filleting’)
vs. filetto di salmone (‘salmon fillet’)) rela-
tionships. ACABIT for French detects concep-
tual relations by using morphological conflating
which implements stripping-recording morpho-
logical rules. We are planning to add these con-
ceptual relationships in ACABIT for Italian in
near future.

Texts may be extracted from different sources which can be classified as their specialisation level, their contents, their pragmatic application, etc. In our case, we are interested in using different texts, in order to analysis the result of automatic extraction in different communicative situations to improve its functioning. A term can be simple if composed by one word, or complex if composed by several words. This paper focuses on extracting and conceptually structuring multi-word terms for Italian. Collet (2000) affirmed that a complex term (multi-word term in our terminology) is a complex unit whose components are separated by a space and are syntactically connected. The resulting unit denominates a concept which belongs to the language for special purposes (LSP). Texts on any domain are easily available on the Web these days. To create a corpus representing a field, materials should be, however analysed and re-elaborated in order to resolve eventual problems arising the transfer of data. In particular, a corpus have to be processed in order to classify the composing units. This classification repre</context>

The affix bio- which can be use as a variant of almost all multi-word terms concerning the biological production such as metodo di produzione biologica (‘method of organic production’) becomes metodo bio and prodotto biologico (‘organic product’) becomes prodotto bio or just bio. In this paper, we present an approach for extracting automatically multi-word terms (MWT) from domain specific corpora for Italian. We also try to conceptually structure them, that is we build the ’conceptual’ structure of variations of multi-word terms where we can learn dynamics of terms (Daille, 2002). Conceptual structure in this paper limits to the semantic relationships between terms such as Hyperonomy, Antony, Set of, and Result between multi-word terms and we currently implement only hyperonomy relations. Actually, this paper is based on our efforts on automatic multi-word terms extraction and its conceptual structure for multiple languages. At present, we mainly focus on English and the major Romance languages such as French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian. This paper is a case study for Italian language.

At the stat, it allows us to identify multi-word terms in corpora to calculate the statistic. At the tri, it allows us to sort and conceptually structure them based on base terms. For the moment, we reimplement universal stat for major Romance languages. We explain the more detailed issues of our reimplementation of ACABIT for Italian in Section 2.3. 2.2 Base Term and its Variations For automatic multi-word term identification, it is necessary to define first the syntactic structures which are potentially lexicalisable (Daille, 2003). We refer to these complex sequences as base terms. For Italian, the syntactic structure of base terms is as follows (where Nouni is a head): 1The translated text is adapted from Agbago and Barrire (2005) 2http://www.bdaille.fr 49 Noun1 Adj area protetta (‘protected area’), azienda agricola (‘agricultural company’) Noun1 Noun2 zona tampone (‘buffer area’) Noun1 di (Det) Noun2 sistema di controllo (‘control system’), conservazione dei biotopi (‘biotope conservation’) Besides these base term structures, there is also [Noun1 a` VZ,,,f] for example for French.

It also shows the semantic relation between multi-word terms. The example of the output is given in Figure 3. A base term, for example area protetto (‘protected area’) is put together with its syntactic variations “area naturale protetto (‘natural protected area’) and area marino protetto (‘marine protected area’).
