The difficulties to be met with the resolu-
tion of syntactical ambiguity in MT can be at
least partially overcome by means of preserving the
syntactical ambiguity of the source language into
the target language. An extensive study of the co-
rrespondences between the syntactically ambiguous
structures in English and Bulgarian has provided a
solid empirical basis in favor of such an approach.
Similar results could be expected for other suffi-
ciently related languages as well. The paper con-
centrates on the linguistic grounds for adopting

1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998897769230769">
Syntactical ambiguity, as part of the ambigui-
ty problem in general, is widely recognized as a
major difficulty in MT. To solve this problem, the
efforts of computational linguists have been main-
ly directed to the process of analysis: a unique
analysis is searched (semantical and/or world
knowledge information being basically employed to
this end), and only having obtained such an ana-
lysis, it is proceeded to the process of synthesis.
On this approach, in addition to the well known
difficulties of general-linguistic and computa-
tional character, there are two principle embarras-
ments to be encountered. It makes us entirely in-
capable to process, first, sentences with &amp;quot;unre-
solvable syntactical ambiguity&amp;quot; (with respect to
the disambiguation information stored), and, se-
condly, sentences which must be translated ambi-
guously (e.g. puns and the like).
In this paper, the burden of solution of the
syntactical ambiguity problem is shifted from the
domain of analysis to the domain of synthesis of
sentences. Thus, instead of trying to resolve such
ambiguities in the source language (SL), syntac-
tically ambiguous sentences are synthesized in the
target language (TL) which preserve their ambigui-
ty, so that the user himself rather than the par-
ser disambiguates the ambiguities in question.
This way of handling syntactical ambiguity
may be viewed as an illustration of a more gene-
ral approach, outlined earlier (Penchev and Peri-
cliev 1982, Pericliev 1983, Penchev and Pericliev
1984), concerned also with other types of ambi-
guities in the SL translated by means of syntacti-
cal, and not only syntactical, ambiguity in the
TL.
In this paper, we will concentrate on the
linguistics grounds for adopting such a manner of
handling of syntactical ambiguity in an English in-
to Bulgarian translation system.

2. PHILOSOPHY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999215228571429">
This approach may be viewed as an attempt to
simulate the behavior of a man-translator who is
linguistically very competent, but is quite unfa-
miliar with the domain he is translating his texts
from. Such a man-translator will be able to say
what words in the original and in the translated
sentence go together under all of the syntactica-
lly admissible analyses; however, he will be, in
general, unable to make a decision as to which of
these parses &amp;quot;make sense&amp;quot;. Our approach will be
an obvious way out of this situation. And it is in
fact not infrequently employed in the everyday
practice of more &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; translators.
We believe that the capacity of such transla-
tors to produce quite intelligible translations is
a fact that can have a very direct bearing on at
least some trends in MT. Resolving syntactical am-
biguity, or, to put it more accurately, evading
syntactical ambiguity in MT following a similar
human-like strategy is only one instance of this.
There are two further points that should be
made in connection with the approach discussed.
We assume as more or less self-evident that:
(i) MT should not be intended to explicate
texts in the SL by means of texts in the TL as
previous approaches imply, but should only tran-
slate them, no matter how ambiguous they might
happen to be;
(ii) Since ambiguities almost always pass un-
noticed in speech, the user will unconsciously
disambiguate them (as in fact he would have done,
had he read the text in the SL); this, in effect,
will not diminish the quality of the translation
in comparison with the original, at least insofar
as ambiguity is concerned.

3. THE DESCRIPTION OF SYNTACTICAL AMBIGUITY
IN ENGLISH AND BULGARIAN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978864833333333">
The empirical basis of the approach is provi-
ded by an extensive study of syntactical ambiguity
in English and Bulgarian (Pericliev 1983), accom-
plished within the framework of a version of de-
pendency grammar using dependency arcs and bra-
cketings. In this study, from a given list of con-
figurations for each language, all logically-ad-
missible ambiguous strings of three types in En-
glish and Bulgarian were calculated. The first
type of syntactically ambiguous strings is of the
form:
1/2
</bodyText>

obj.dir(what?)
where A, B, ... are complexes of word-classes,
&amp;quot;---:&gt;&amp;quot; is a dependency arc, and 1, 2, ... are syn-
tactical relations.
The second type is of the form:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.388699285714286">

(2) A C, e.g.

The third type is of the form:
(3) A 1 1C, e.g.
adv.mod(how?)
1 %:1
He failed(V) entirely(Adv) to cheat(Vinf) her
1
adv.mod(how?)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998692">
It was found, first, that almost all logically
-admissible strings of the three types are actually
realized in both languages (cf. the same result al-
so for Russian in Jordanskaja (1967)). Secondly,
and more important, there turned out to be a stri-
king coincidence between the strings in English and
Bulgarian; the latter was to be expected from the
coincidence of configurations in both languages as
well as from their sufficiently similar global
syntactic organization.

4. TRANSLATIONAL PROBLEMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994675">
With a view to the aims of translation, it
was convenient to distinguish two cases: Case A, in
which to each syntactically ambiguous string in En-
glish corresponds a syntactically ambiguous string
in Bulgarian, and Case B, in which to some English
strings do not correspond any Bulgarian ones;
Case A provides a possibility for literal English
into Bulgarian translation, while there is no such
possibility for sentences containing strings
classed under Case B.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.806278">
4.1. Case A: Literal Translation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977894736842">
English strings which can be literally tran-
slated into Bulgarian comprise,roughly speaking,
the majority and the most common of strings to
appear in real English texts. Informally, these
strings can be included into several large groups
of syntactically ambiguous constructions, such as
constructions with &amp;quot;floating&amp;quot; word-classes (Ad-
verbs, Prepositional Phrases, etc. acting as slaves
either to one, or to another master-word), constru-
ctions with prepositional and post-positional ad-
juncts to conjoined groups, constructions with se-
veral conjoined members, constructions with symmet-
rical predicates, some elliptical constructions,
etc.
Due to space limitations, a few English phra-
ses with their literal translations will suffice
as an illustration of Case A. (Further on, syntac-
tical relations as labels of arcs will be omitted
where superfluous in marking the ambiguity):

4.2. Case B: Non-Literal Translation
English strings which cannot be literally
translated into Bulgarian are such strings which
contain: (i) word-classes (Vint. Gerund) not pre-
sent in Bulgarian, and/or (ii) syntactical
relations (e.g. &amp;quot;composite&amp;quot;: language&apos;.--- theory,
etc.) not present in Bulgarian, and/or (iii) other
differences (in global syntactical organization,
agreement, etc.).
It will be shown how certain English strings
falling under this heading are related to Bulgarian
strings preserving their ambiguity. A way to over-
come difficulties with (ii) and (iii) is exempli-
fied on a very common (complex) string, viz.
Adj/N/Prt+N/N&apos;s+N (e.g. stylish gentlemen&apos;s suits).
As an illustration, here we confine to prob-
lems to be met with (i), and, more concretely, to
such English strings containing Vint. These strings
are mapped onto Bulgarian strings containing
da-construction or a verbal noun (Vinf generally
being translated either way). E.g. the Vinf in
obj.dir

<equation confidence="0.935749">

(promised what or why?) is rendered by a da-con-

<bodyText confidence="0.991776933333333">
Yet in other strings, e.g. The chicken(N) is
ready(Adj) to eat(Vint) (the chicken eats or is
eaten?), in order to preserve the ambiguity the
infinitive should be rendered by a prepositional
verbal noun: Pileto(N) e gotovo(Adj) za jadene
(PrVb1N), rather than with the finite da-construc-
tion, since in the latter case we would obtain
two unambiguous translations: Pileto e gotovo da
jade (the chicken eats) or Pileto e gotovo da se
jade (the chicken is eaten), and so on.
For some English strings no syntactically am-
biguous Bulgarian strings could be put into corres-
pondence, so that a translation with our method
proved to be an impossibility. E.g.
predicative
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6344694">

(10) He found(V) the mechanic(N) a helper(N)
r
1;%
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9427555">
obj.indir 4
obj.dir
(either the mechanic or someone else is the helper)
is such a sentence due to the impossibility in Bul-
garianibr two non-prepositional objects, a direct
and an indirect one, to appear in a sentence.

4.3. Multiple Syntactical Ambiguity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998001">
Many very frequently encountered cases of mul-
tiple syntactical ambiguity can also be handled
successfully within this approach. E.g. a phrase
like Cybernetical devices and systems for automatic
control and diagnosis in biomedicine with more than
30 possible parsings is amenable to literal trans-
lation into Bulgarian.

4.4. Semantically Irrelevant Syntactical
Ambiguity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995940076923077">
Disambiguating syntactical ambiguity is an im-
portant task in MT only because different meanings
are usually associated with the different syntac-
tical descriptions. This, however, is not always
the case. There are some constructions in English
the syntactical ambiguity of which cannot lead to
multiple understanding. E.g. in sentences of the
form A is not B (He is not happy), in which the ad-
verbial particle not is either a verbal negation
(He isn&apos;t happy) or a non-verbal negation (He&apos;s not
happy), the different syntactical trees will be in-
terpreted semantically as synonymous: &apos;A is not B&apos;
is not-B&apos;.

<bodyText confidence="0.999984461538462">
We should not worry about finding Bulgarian
syntactically ambiguous correspondences for such
English constructions. We can choose arbitrarily
one analysis, since either of the syntactical des-
criptions will provide correct information for
our translational purposes. Indeed, the construc-
tion above has no ambiguous Bulgarian correspon-
dence: in Bulgarian the negating particle combines
either with the verb (then it is written as a se-
parate word) or with the adjective (in which case
it is prefixed to it). Either construction, how-
ever, will yield a correct translation: Toj me e
radosten or Toj e neradosten.

4.5. A Lexical Problem
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959310344828">
Certain difficulties may arise, having managed
to map English syntactically ambiguous strings onto
ambiguous Bulgarian ones. These difficulties are
due to the different behavior of certain English
lexemes in comparison to their Bulgarian equiva-
lents. This behavior is displayed in the phenomenon
we call &amp;quot;intralingual lexical-resolution of syn-
tactical ambiguity&amp;quot; (the substitution of lexemes
in the SL with their translational equivalents
from the TL results in the resolution of the syn-
tactical ambiguity).
For instance, in spite of the existence of am-
biguous strings in both languages of the form
Verbtr/itr212E.11/114&gt;Noun, with some particular le-
xemes (e.g. 212224r/itr===&gt;zastreljamtr or
strelj&amp;quot;itr)&apos; in which to one English lexeme co-
rrespond two in Bulgarian (one only transitive, and
the other only intransitive), the ambiguity in the
translation will be lost. This situation explains
why it seems impossible to translate ambiguously
into Bulgarian examples containing verbs of the
type given, or verbal nouns formed from such verbs,
as the case is in The shooting of the hunters.
This problem, however, could be generally tackled
in the translation into Bulgarian, since it is a
language usually providing a series of forms for a
verb: transitive, intransitive, and transitive/in-
transitive, which are more or less synonymous ?for
more details, cf. Penchev and Pericliev (1984)).

5. CONCLUDING REMARKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929796296296">
To conclude, some syntactically ambiguous
strings in English can have literal, others non-li-
teral, and still others do not have any correspon-
dences in Bulgarian. In summary, from a total num-
ber of approximately 200 simple strings treated in
English more than 3/4 can, and only 1/4 cannot, be
literally translated; about half of the latter
strings can be put into correspondence with syntac-
tically ambiguous strings in Bulgarian preserving
their ambiguity. This gives quite a strong support
to the usefulness of our approach in an English in-
to Bulgarian translation system.
Several advantages of this way of handling of
syntactical ambiguity can be mentioned.
First, in the processing of the majority of
syntactically ambiguous sentences within an En-
glish into Bulgarian translation system it dispen-
ses with semantical and world knowledge information
at the very low cost of studying the ambiguity co-
rrespondences in both languages. It could be expec-
ted that investigations along this line will prove
to be fruitful for other pairs of languages as
well.
Secondly, whenever this way of handling syn-
tactical ambiguity is applicable, the impossibili-
ty of previous approaches to translate sentences
with unresolvable ambiguity, or such with verbal
jokes and the like, turns out to be an easily
attainable task.
Thirdly, the approach seems to have a very na-
tural extension to another principal difficulty in
MT, viz. coreference (cf. the three-ways ambiguity
of Jim hit John and then he (Jim, John or neither?)
went away and the same ambiguity of tot (=he) in
its literal translation into Bulgarian: Djim udari
Djon i togava toj(?) si otide).
And, finally, there is yet another reason for
adopting the approach discussed here. Even if we
choose to go another way and (somehow) disambigu-
ate sentences in the SL, almost certainly their
translational equivalents will be again syntacti-
cally ambiguous, and quite probably preserve the
very ambiguity we tried to resolve. In this sense,
for the purposes of MT (or other man-oriented
applications of CL) we need not waste our efforts
to disambiguate e.g. sentences like John hit the
dog with the long bat or John hit the dog with the
long wool, since, even if we have done that, the
correct Bulgarian translations of both these sen-
tences are syntactically ambiguous in exactly the
same way, the resolution of ambiguity thus proving
to be an entirely superfluous operation (cf. Djon
udari kucheto s dalgata palka and Djon udari ku-
cheto s dalgata valna).

In summary, from a total number of approximately 200 simple strings treated in English more than 3/4 can, and only 1/4 cannot, be literally translated; about half of the latter strings can be put into correspondence with syntactically ambiguous strings in Bulgarian preserving their ambiguity. This gives quite a strong support to the usefulness of our approach in an English into Bulgarian translation system. Se</context>

In this paper, the burden of solution of the syntactical ambiguity problem is shifted from the domain of analysis to the domain of synthesis of sentences. Thus, instead of trying to resolve such ambiguities in the source language (SL), syntactically ambiguous sentences are synthesized in the target language (TL) which preserve their ambiguity, so that the user himself rather than the parser disambiguates the ambiguities in question. This way of handling syntactical ambiguity may be viewed as an illustration of a more general approach, outlined earlier (Penchev and Pericliev 1982, Pericliev 1983, Penchev and Pericliev 1984), concerned also with other types of ambiguities in the SL translated by means of syntactical, and not only syntactical, ambiguity in the TL. In this paper, we will concentrate on the linguistics grounds for adopting such a manner of handling of syntactical ambiguity in an English into Bulgarian translation system. 2. PHILOSOPHY This approach may be viewed as an attempt to simulate the behavior of a man-translator who is linguistically very competent, but is quite unfamiliar with the domain he is translating his texts from. Such a man-translator will be able to say</context>

THE DESCRIPTION OF SYNTACTICAL AMBIGUITY IN ENGLISH AND BULGARIAN The empirical basis of the approach is provided by an extensive study of syntactical ambiguity in English and Bulgarian (Pericliev 1983), accomplished within the framework of a version of dependency grammar using dependency arcs and bracketings. In this study, from a given list of configurations for each language, all logically-admissible ambiguous strings of three types in English and Bulgarian were calculated. The first type of syntactically ambiguous strings is of the form: 1/2 (1) A e.g. adv.mod(how long?) The statistician studied(V) the whole year(PP), 1 A obj.dir(what?) where A, B, ... are complexes of word-classes, &amp;quot;---:&gt;&amp;quot; is a dependency arc, and 1, 2, ... are syntactical relations. The second type is of the form: 1 2 </context>
