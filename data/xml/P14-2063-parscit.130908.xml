<bodyText confidence="0.99993356">
Sentiment analysis in a multilingual
world remains a challenging problem, be-
cause developing language-specific senti-
ment lexicons is an extremely resource-
intensive process. Such lexicons remain a
scarce resource for most languages.
In this paper, we address this lexicon gap
by building high-quality sentiment lexi-
cons for 136 major languages. We in-
tegrate a variety of linguistic resources
to produce an immense knowledge graph.
By appropriately propagating from seed
words, we construct sentiment lexicons for
each component language of our graph.
Our lexicons have a polarity agreement
of 95.7% with published lexicons, while
achieving an overall coverage of 45.2%.
We demonstrate the performance of our
lexicons in an extrinsic analysis of 2,000
distinct historical figures’ Wikipedia ar-
ticles on 30 languages. Despite cul-
tural difference and the intended neutrality
of Wikipedia articles, our lexicons show
an average sentiment correlation of 0.28
across all language pairs.

Sentiment analysis of English texts has become a
large and active research area, with many commer-
cial applications, but the barrier of language limits
the ability to assess the sentiment of most of the
world’s population.
Although several well-regarded sentiment lexi-
cons are available in English (Esuli and Sebastiani,
2006; Liu, 2010), the same is not true for most
of the world’s languages. Indeed, our literature
search identified only 12 publicly available sen-
timent lexicons for only 5 non-English languages

that these resources are not widely available for
most important languages.
In this paper, we strive to produce a comprehen-
sive set of sentiment lexicons for the worlds’ major
languages. We make the following contributions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.85139372">
• New Sentiment Analysis Resources – We have
generated sentiment lexicons for 136 major
languages via graph propagation which are
now publicly available1. We validate our own
work through other publicly available, human
annotated sentiment lexicons. Indeed, our
lexicons have polarity agreement of 95.7%
with these published lexicons, plus an over-
all coverage of 45.2%.
• Large-Scale Language Knowledge Graph
Analysis – We have created a massive com-
prehensive knowledge graph of 7 million vo-
cabulary words from 136 languages with over
131 million semantic inter-language links,
which proves valuable when doing alignment
between definitions in different languages.
• Extrinsic Evaluation – We elucidate the sen-
timent consistency of entities reported in dif-
ferent language editions of Wikipedia using
our propagated lexicons. In particular, we
pick 30 languages and compute sentiment
scores for 2,000 distinct historical figures.
Each language pair exhibits a Spearman sen-
timent correlation of at least 0.14, with an av-
erage correlation of 0.28 over all pairs.

Sentiment analysis is an important area of NLP
with a large and growing literature. Excellent sur-
veys of the field include (Liu, 2013; Pang and Lee,
2008), establishing that rich online resources have
greatly expanded opportunities for opinion min-
ing and sentiment analysis. Godbole et al. (2007)
build up an English lexicon-based sentiment anal-
ysis system to evaluate the general reputation of
entities. Taboada et al. (2011) present a more so-
phisticated model by considering patterns, includ-
ing negation and repetition using adjusted weights.
Liu (2010) introduces an efficient method, at the
state of the art, for doing sentiment analysis and
subjectivity in English.
Researchers have investigated topic or domain
dependent approaches to identify opinions. Jijk-
oun et al. (2010) focus on generating topic spe-
cific sentiment lexicons. Li et al. (2010) extract
sentiment with global and local topic dependency.
Gindl et al. (2010) perform sentiment analysis ac-
cording to cross-domain contextualization and Pak
and Paroubek (2010) focus on Twitter, doing re-
search on colloquial format of English.
Work has been done to generalize sentiment
analysis to other languages. Denecke (2008) per-
forms multilingual sentiment analysis using Sen-
tiWordNet. Mihalcea et al. (2007) learn multi-
lingual subjectivity via cross-lingual projections.
Abbasi et al. (2008) extract specific language fea-
tures of Arabic which requires language-specific
knowledge. Ginsc˘a et al. (2011) work on better
sentiment analysis system in Romanian.
The ready availability of machine translation to
and from English has prompted efforts to employ
translation for sentiment analysis (Bautin et al.,
2008). Banea et al. (2008) demonstrate that ma-
chine translation can perform quite well when ex-
tending the subjectivity analysis to multi-lingual
environment, which makes it inspiring to replicate
their work on lexicon-based sentiment analysis.
Machine learning approaches to sentiment anal-
ysis are attractive, because of the promise of re-
duced manual processing. Boiy and Moens (2009)
conduct machine learning sentiment analysis us-
ing multilingual web texts. Deep learning ap-
proaches draft off of distributed word embedding
which offer concise features reflecting the seman-
tics of the underlying vocabulary. Turian et al.
(2010) create powerful word embedding by train-
ing on real and corrupted phrases, optimizing for
the replaceability of words. Zou et al. (2013) com-
bine machine translation and word representation
to generate bilingual language resources. Socher
et al. (2012) demonstrates a powerful approach to
English sentiment using word embedding, which
can easily be extended to other languages by train-
ing on appropriate text corpora.

3 Knowledge Graph Construction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99495225">
In this section we will describe how we leverage
off a variety of NLP resources to construct the se-
mantic connection graph we will use to propagate
sentiment lexicons.
</bodyText>

showing links between words and edge represen-
tation to preserve source identity. For each edge
between corresponding words, a 5-bit integer will
record the existence of 5 possible semantic links.
The Polyglot project (Al-Rfou et al., 2013)
identified the 100,000 most frequently used words
in each language’s Wikipedia. Drawing a can-
didate lexicon from Wikipedia has some down-
sides (e.g. limited use of informal words), but is
representative and convenient over a large num-
ber of languages. In particular, we collect total
of 7,741,544 high-frequency words from 136 lan-
guages to serve as vertices in our graph.
We seek to identify as many semantic links
across languages as possible to connect our net-
work, and so integrated several resources:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997097">
• Wiktionary – This growing resource has en-

<bodyText confidence="0.9999345">
tries for 171 languages, edited by people
with sufficient background knowledge. Wik-
tionary provides about 19.7% of the total
links covering 382,754 vertices in our graph.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999120227272727">
• Machine Translation - We script the Google
translation API to get even more semantic
links. In particular we ask for translations of
each word in our English vocabulary to 57
languages with available translators as well
as going from each known vocabulary word
in other languages to English. In total, ma-
chine translation provides 53.2% of the to-
tal links and establishes connections between
3.5 million vertices.
• Transliteration Links – Natural flow brings
words across languages with little morpho-
logical change. Closely related language
pairs (i.e. Russian and Ukrainian) share many
characters/words in common. Though not al-
ways true, words with same spelling usually
have similar meanings so this can improve
the coverage of semantic links. Translitera-
tion provides 22.1% of the total links in our
experiment.
• WordNet – Finally, we gather synonyms and
antonyms of English words from WordNet,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.876213444444444">
which prove particularly useful in propagat-
ing sentiment across languages. In total we
collect over 100,000 pairs of synonyms and
antonyms and created 5.0% of the total links.
Links do not always agree in a bidirectional
manner, particularly for multi-sense words, thus
all links in our network are unidirectional. Figure
1 illustrates how we encode links from different
resources in an integer edge value.

4 Graph Propagation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996267666666667">
Sentiment propagation starts from English senti-
ment lexicons. Through semantic links in our
knowledge graph, words are able to extend their
sentiment polarities to adjacent neighbors. We
experimented with both graph propagation algo-
rithm (Velikovich et al., 2010) and label propaga-
tion algorithm (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Rao
and Ravichandran, 2009). The primary differ-
ence between is that label propagation takes multi-
ple paths between two vertices into consideration,
while graph propagation utilizes only the best path
between word pairs.
We report results from using Liu’s lexicons
(Liu, 2010) as seed words. Liu’s lexicons con-
tain 2006 positive words and 4783 negative words.
Of these, 1422 positive words and 2956 negative
words (roughly 64.5%) appear among the 100,000
English vertices in our graph.

Acc represents the ratio of identical polarity be-
tween our analysis and the published lexicons.
Cov reflects what faction of our lexicons overlap
with published lexicons.
Our knowledge network is comprised of links
from a heterogeneous collection of sources, of dif-
ferent coverage and reliability. For the task of de-
ciding sentiment polarity of words, only antonym
links are negative. An edge gains zero weight
if both negative and positive links exist. Edges
having multiple positive links will be credited the
highest weight among all these links. We con-
ducted a grid search on the weight of each type of
links to maximize the best overall accuracy on our
test data of published non-English sentiment lexi-
cons. To avoid potential overfitting problems, grid
search starts from SentiWordNet English lexicons
(Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) instead of Liu’s.

We present the accuracy and coverage achieved
by two propagation model in Table 1. Both mod-
els achieve similar accuracy while slightly more
words in graph propagation can be verified via
published lexicons. Performance is not good on
Japanese because of mismatching between our
dictionary and the test data.
Table 2 reveals that very sparse sentiment lex-
icons resulted for a small but notable fraction of
the languages we analyzed. In particular, only 20
languages yielded lexicons of less than 100 words.
Without exception, they all have very small avail-
able definitions in Wikitionary. By contrast, 48
languages had lexicons with over 2,000 words, an-
other 16 with between 1,000 and 2,000: clearly
large enough to perform a meaningful analysis.

We consider evaluating our lexicons on the con-

Wikipedia pages of 2,000 most significant peo-
ple as measured in the recent book Who’s Bigger?

ity of a page is simply computed by subtracting

the number of negative words from that of posi-
tive words, divided by the sum of both.
The differing ratio of positive and negative po-
larity terms in Table 2 means that sentiment cannot
be directly compared across languages. For more
consistent evaluation we compute the z-score of
each entity against the distribution of all its lan-
guage’s entities.
We use the Spearman correlation coefficient to
measure the consistence of sentiment distribution
across all entities with pages in a particular lan-
guage pair. Figure 2 shows the results for 30 lan-
guages with largest propagated sentiment lexicon
size. All pairs of language exhibit positive corre-
lation (and hence generally stable and consistent
sentiment), with an average correlation of 0.28.
Finally, Table 3 illustrates sentiment consis-
tency over all 136 languages (represented by blue
tick marks), with the first 10 languages in Figure 2
granted labels. Respected artists like Steven Spiel-
berg and Leonardo da Vinci show as consistently
positive sentiment as notorious figures like Osama

Our knowledge graph propagation is generally ef-
fective at producing useful sentiment lexicons. In-
terestingly, the ratio of positive sentiment words
is strongly connected with number of sentiment
words – it is noteworthy that English has the
smallest ratio of positive lexicon terms. The

phenomenon possibly shows that many negative
words reflecting cultural nuances do not translate
wel. We believe that this ratio can be consid-
ered as quality measurement of the propagation.
Similar approaches can be extended to other NLP
tasks using different semantic links, specific dic-
tionary and special seed words. Future work will
revolve around learning modifiers, negation terms,
and various entity/sentiment attribution.

<abstract confidence="0.999426846153846">Sentiment analysis in a multilingual world remains a challenging problem, because developing language-specific sentiment lexicons is an extremely resourceintensive process. Such lexicons remain a scarce resource for most languages. In this paper, we address this lexicon gap by building high-quality sentiment lexicons for 136 major languages. We integrate a variety of linguistic resources to produce an immense knowledge graph. By appropriately propagating from seed words, we construct sentiment lexicons for each component language of our graph. Our lexicons have a polarity agreement of 95.7% with published lexicons, while achieving an overall coverage of 45.2%. We demonstrate the performance of our lexicons in an extrinsic analysis of 2,000 distinct historical figures’ Wikipedia articles on 30 languages. Despite cultural difference and the intended neutrality of Wikipedia articles, our lexicons show an average sentiment correlation of 0.28 across all language pairs.</abstract>

Figure 1: Illustration of our knowledge graph, showing links between words and edge representation to preserve source identity. For each edge between corresponding words, a 5-bit integer will record the existence of 5 possible semantic links. The Polyglot project (Al-Rfou et al., 2013) identified the 100,000 most frequently used words in each language’s Wikipedia. Drawing a candidate lexicon from Wikipedia has some downsides (e.g. limited use of informal words), but is representative and convenient over a large number of languages. In particular, we collect total of 7,741,544 high-frequency words from 136 languages to serve as vertices in our graph. We seek to identify as many semantic links across languages as possible to connect our network, and so integrated several resources: • Wiktionary – This growing resource has en384 tries for 171 languages, edited by people with s</context>

Despite cultural difference and the intended neutrality of Wikipedia articles, our lexicons show an average sentiment correlation of 0.28 across all language pairs. 1 Introduction Sentiment analysis of English texts has become a large and active research area, with many commercial applications, but the barrier of language limits the ability to assess the sentiment of most of the world’s population. Although several well-regarded sentiment lexicons are available in English (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Liu, 2010), the same is not true for most of the world’s languages. Indeed, our literature search identified only 12 publicly available sentiment lexicons for only 5 non-English languages (Chinese mandarin, German, Arabic, Japanese and Steven Skiena Computer Science Dept. Stony Brook University Stony Brook, NY 11794 skiena@cs.stonybrook.edu Italian). No doubt we missed some, but it is clear that these resources are not widely available for most important languages.

For the task of deciding sentiment polarity of words, only antonym links are negative. An edge gains zero weight if both negative and positive links exist. Edges having multiple positive links will be credited the highest weight among all these links. We conducted a grid search on the weight of each type of links to maximize the best overall accuracy on our test data of published non-English sentiment lexicons. To avoid potential overfitting problems, grid search starts from SentiWordNet English lexicons (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) instead of Liu’s. 5 Lexicon Evaluation We collected all available published sentiment lexicons from non-English languages to serve as standard for our evaluation, including Arabic, Italian, German and Chinese.

Despite cultural difference and the intended neutrality of Wikipedia articles, our lexicons show an average sentiment correlation of 0.28 across all language pairs. 1 Introduction Sentiment analysis of English texts has become a large and active research area, with many commercial applications, but the barrier of language limits the ability to assess the sentiment of most of the world’s population. Although several well-regarded sentiment lexicons are available in English (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Liu, 2010), the same is not true for most of the world’s languages. Indeed, our literature search identified only 12 publicly available sentiment lexicons for only 5 non-English languages (Chinese mandarin, German, Arabic, Japanese and Steven Skiena Computer Science Dept. Stony Brook University Stony Brook, NY 11794 skiena@cs.stonybrook.edu Italian). No doubt we missed some, but it is clear that these resources are not widely available for most important languages. In this paper, we strive to produce a comprehensive set of sentiment lexicons for the worlds’ major languages. We make the following contrib</context>

As our candidate entities for analysis, we use the Wikipedia pages of 2,000 most significant people as measured in the recent book Who’s Bigger? (Skiena and Ward, 2013).

Boiy and Moens (2009) conduct machine learning sentiment analysis using multilingual web texts. Deep learning approaches draft off of distributed word embedding which offer concise features reflecting the semantics of the underlying vocabulary. Turian et al. (2010) create powerful word embedding by training on real and corrupted phrases, optimizing for the replaceability of words. Zou et al. (2013) combine machine translation and word representation to generate bilingual language resources. Socher et al. (2012) demonstrates a powerful approach to English sentiment using word embedding, which can easily be extended to other languages by training on appropriate text corpora. 3 Knowledge Graph Construction In this section we will describe how we leverage off a variety of NLP resources to construct the semantic connection graph we will use to propagate sentiment lexicons.

Excellent surveys of the field include (Liu, 2013; Pang and Lee, 2008), establishing that rich online resources have greatly expanded opportunities for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Godbole et al. (2007) build up an English lexicon-based sentiment analysis system to evaluate the general reputation of entities. Taboada et al. (2011) present a more sophisticated model by considering patterns, including negation and repetition using adjusted weights. Liu (2010) introduces an efficient method, at the state of the art, for doing sentiment analysis and subjectivity in English. Researchers have investigated topic or domain dependent approaches to identify opinions. Jijkoun et al. (2010) focus on generating topic specific sentiment lexicons. Li et al. (2010) extract sentiment with global and local topic dependency. Gindl et al. (2010) perform sentiment analysis according to cross-domain contextualization and Pak and Paroubek (2</context>

In total we collect over 100,000 pairs of synonyms and antonyms and created 5.0% of the total links. Links do not always agree in a bidirectional manner, particularly for multi-sense words, thus all links in our network are unidirectional. Figure 1 illustrates how we encode links from different resources in an integer edge value. 4 Graph Propagation Sentiment propagation starts from English sentiment lexicons. Through semantic links in our knowledge graph, words are able to extend their sentiment polarities to adjacent neighbors. We experimented with both graph propagation algorithm (Velikovich et al., 2010) and label propagation algorithm (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009). The primary difference between is that label propagation takes multiple paths between two vertices into consideration, while graph propagation utilizes only the best path between word pairs. We report results from using Liu’s lexicons (Liu, 2010) as seed words. Liu’s lexicons contain 2006 positive words and 4783 negative words. Of these, 1422 positive words and 2956 negative words (roughly 64.5%) appear among the 100,000 English vertices in our graph. Dataset Propagation Acc Cov Arabic Label 0.93 0.45 Grap</context>
