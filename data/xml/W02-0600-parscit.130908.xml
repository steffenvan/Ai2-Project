This is the sixth workshop on computational phonology (and now morphology!) held by
SIGPHON, the ACL Special Interest Group in Computational Phonology. We are happy
this year to be holding the workshop with the cooperation of SIGNLL, the ACL Special
Interest Group in Natural Language Learning.
As the name of our workshop suggests, the topic this year includes not only phonology,
but also morphology—and in fact all but one of the papers are about morphology. The
boundary between these two disciplines has always been fuzzy, and indeed many of the
interesting problems in phonology would not arise were it not for morphology.
The traditional way to build a computationally interpretable morphological grammar and
lexicon (if one can speak of a tradition in such a young discipline) is to do so by hand.
While this is still the dominant way to build morphological grammars, there has been an
increasing interest in the last few years in machine learning techniques.
The papers in this workshop explore some of the ways machine learning could be brought
to bear on the task of building grammars for morphology and phonology. Given the
traditional definition of a morpheme as the smallest unit with meaning, linguists may be
surprised that none of the morphology learning methods described here uses bilingual
text to infer semantics. There are several reasons for that, but some of the approaches
described here do use word-level co-occurrence as a substitute for richer forms of
semantic representation.
It is my pleasure to thank our invited speaker, David Yarowsky (of Johns Hopkins
University), for his presentation, “Bootstrapping morphological analyzers from
monolingual and bilingual data—building multimodal bridges”. In addition, I thank
Mikhail Belkin and John Goldsmith (both of The University of Chicago) and Adam
Albright and Bruce Hayes (of UCLA) for accepting our invitation to present their work.
Without ACL’s generous support, it would not have been possible to hold this workshop.
Finally, I want to thank the other members of the program committee for their advice,
and for reviewing the papers on a tight schedule: Antal van den Bosch (Tilburg
University, and our representative from SIGNLL), Jason Eisner (Johns Hopkins
