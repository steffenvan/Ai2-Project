Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999987357142857">
The purpose of this study is to construct a
semantic analysis method for disambiguating
Japanese compound verbs. Japanese speakers
produce a rich variety of compound verbs,
making it difficult to process them by computer.
We construct a method employing 110
disambiguation rules based on the semantic
features of the first verb of a compound and
syntactic patterns consisting of co-occurrence
between verbs and nouns. The disambiguation
rules are evaluated by applying them to
compound verbs in the dictionary. The
obtained accuracy is 87.19% for our rules. This
result shows the advantage of our method.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99724443">
The treatment of multiword expressions (MWEs)
has attracted much interest as an important issue
(Sag et al. 2002). Japanese has diverse types of
MWEs and there are difficulties in processing them
(Baldwin and Bond 2002). In those studies, MWEs
are defined as a “word with spaces” in English and
“idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word
boundaries” in Japanese. Verb particles as one type
of MWE in English have been studied (Villavicencio
and Copestake 2002). We predict that verb particles
in English and compound verbs in Japanese have
commonalities in terms of ambiguity and semantic
constraints. For example, the English particle “up”
has both an aspectual (“finish up writing” cf.
“kaki-owaru”) and a spatial meaning (“go up the
stairs” cf. “kake-agaru”), which is equivalent to the
second verb in Japanese compound verbs. We
investigate Japanese compound verbs (JCVs) and
extract semantic constraints for the purpose of
applying them to machine translation.
JCVs consist of two verbs, the first verb (V1)
and the second verb (V2). V1 always appears in the
continuative form. In this paper, we discuss only
“Verb-Verb” JCVs, which are a composition of two
native Japanese verbs, for example oshi-ageru “push
up”, tabe-sugiru “eat too much” and so on. JCVs of
V1-V2 form are frequently used for expressing
complex motion, elaborated phenomena and
emotional state. However, JCVs have high
productivity, a great number of ambiguities and
semantic constraints between each constituent.
Examples of correlation between semantic constraint
and ambiguities of JCVs are given in (1).
(1) a. nage-ageru “throw up”, keri-ageru “kick up”,
mochi-ageru “lift up”, oshi-ageru “push up”
b. yude-ageru “finish boiling”, mushi-ageru
“finish steaming”, yaki-ageru “finish baking”
Ageru “lift” has multiple meanings when it appears
in the V2 position of a JCV. A directional compound
verb in (1a) is formed by compounding ageru “lift”
as V2 with a verb of motion like nageru “throw” and
keru “kick” as V1. Conversely, an aspectual
compound verb in (1b) is formed by combining
ageru “lift” as V2 with a verb of cooking process
like yuderu “boil” and musu “steam” as V1. There
are a small number of such ambiguous verbs which
appear as V2. Ambiguous JCVs are generated by
compounding various instances of V1 with an
ambiguous V2, which makes it difficult to process
on computer.
The analysis of JCVs has been discussed in the
field of linguistics and natural language processing.
In linguistics, JCVs have been studied mainly in
terms of syntax (Kageyama 1999) and constraints on
semantic structures (Matsumoto 1996, 1998).
Himeno (2000) made a semantic analysis
concerning the types of V2s which have multiple
meanings. She classified JCVs by the meaning of
their V2. However, she confounded the meaning of
V1 with that of V2 in her classification. In order to
clarify the semantic constraints between V1 and V2,
we need to analyze each constituent individually.
In natural language processing, Shirai (1998)
proposed a method of building valency patterns for
JCVs by compiling a Japanese and English corpus.
This approach, in which whole compound verbs are
registered in an electronic dictionary, can improve
the translation rate of the system. However, it is
inefficient to register all the compound verbs in
advance. For that reason, it is desirable to develop a
framework for understanding JCVs by processing
each constituent.
Based on this background, we propose a method
employing rules which utilize semantic features and
syntactic information to clarify the semantic
constraints for disambiguation of JCVs.
In this paper, we take two steps in order to
construct a disambiguation method. The first step is
to identify the meaning of V1 using by rules which
an MT system or other lexical database should have
already. The second step is to classify JCVs into
semantic clusters and extract commonalities of
semantic features on V1 (semantic information) and
verb complements (syntactic information). We build
rules using this obtained semantic and syntactic
information. This is the major innovation of this
study. The proposed method based on
disambiguation rules has the advantage of being able
to analyze new compound verbs not in the dictionary.
Since the semantic restrictions of JCVs are similar to
those of phrasal verbs in English (Villavicencio and
Copestake 2002), there might be a possibility of
applying our method to machine translation.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 describes the definition, ambiguities and
semantic relations of JCVs. Section 3 shows analysis
results. The semantic analysis method is explained in
Section 4. The evaluation of this method is discussed
in Section 5. The conclusion of our study and
implication for future work are stated at the end.

2 Ambiguities of JCVs
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999197">
2.1 Types of Ambiguities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906">
Kageyama (1993) has proposed that JCVs can
be analyzed by the argument structure of each
constituent and divided into two types: syntactic
compounds and lexical compounds. Lexical
compounds have semantic constraints and are
limited to lexically specified combinations, whereas
syntactic compounds are basically compositional
and have no lexical idiosyncrasies .
We do not differentiate these two types in
advance, because our method may be also useful for
identifying them. There are two types of ambiguity
in JCVs: ambiguities within lexical compounds and
ambiguities between lexical compounds and
syntactic compounds.
Lexical compounds containing an ambiguous
V2 (as in example (1)) are examined in this study.
Semantic constraints govern the pairs of verbs which
may be compounded. The semantic features of V1
play a key role in identifying the meaning of V2. We
focus on extracting commonalities of semantic
features from V1 in order to disambiguate V2.
On the other hand, some JCVs are ambiguous,
because they may be either syntactic or lexical
compounds depending on context. Syntactic
information is important in disambiguating this type
of JCV. Example (2) indicates that JCVs with the
same morphology change their meanings depending
on specific context.

“The bus ran past the bus stop.”
b. Kare wa shiai no tame ni hashiri-sugita.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9961785">
“He ran too much because of the game.”
V2 sugiru in the lexical compound in (2a) means
path of motion (“go past”), but in the syntactic
compound in (2b) it denotes excessiveness (“too
much”). As sugiru is most commonly used as a
compositional V2 (“too much”), it is difficult to
identify the difference between (2a) and (2b). Since
sentence (2a) includes a word indicating the place
like basutei “bus stop”, we can distinguish the
difference between the lexical compound (2a) and
the syntactic compound (2b) by co-occurring words.
We identify the meaning of such JCVs using
syntactic information gained from co-occurrence and
verb complements.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999364">
2.2 Ambiguities of V2
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998079289473684">
We classified ambiguities of V2 into three semantic
clusters: aspectual, spatial and adverbial (Niimi
1987). An ambiguous V2 is defined as a word with
multiple meanings which overlap several semantic
clusters. This framework makes it easier to
distinguish the difference in meaning for an
ambiguous V2.
We listed all the ambiguous V2, i.e. the
following 20 words, based on the previous study
(Himeno 2001).
agaru “go up”, ageru “lift”, otosu “drop”, kakeru
“hang”, kakaru “hang onto”, kaeru “go back”,
kaesu “send back”, iru “enter”, komu “insert”,
sugiru “go past”, tatsu “stand”, tateru “make
stand”, tsuku “be attached”, tsukeru “attach”, dasu
“put out”, kiru “cut”, toosu “pierce”, nuku “pull
out”, tobasu “scatter”, wataru “go across”
For the first step of analysis, we extracted 10
ambiguous words at random, agaru “go up”, ageru
“lift”, otosu “drop”, kakeru “hang”, kakaru “hang
onto”, kaeru “go back”, kaesu “send back”, iru
“enter”, komu “insert” and sugiru “go past”. Table 1
shows examples of ambiguities of V2 as JCVs.
V2 Aspectual Spatial Adverbial
agaru yude-agaru tobi-agaru furue-agaru
“go up” “finish boiling” “ jump up” “be terrified”
kakaru ochi-kakaru kiri-kakaru
“hang onto” “be dropping” “slash at”
otosu kiri-otosu ii-otosu
“drop” “cut off” “forget to say”
kaeru uchi-kaesu waki-kaeru

We are not concerned here with disambiguation
of the meanings within a single cluster. For example,
tabe-kakeru “already begin to eat” and
hashiri-kakeru “be about to run” are both classified
as members of the aspectual cluster. JCVs of the
adverbial cluster which include naosu “fix” and au
“fit” seem to be similar cases. Such differences
are not analyzed in this study.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.960527">
2.3 Criteria for Classification of Semantic Cluster
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981419354839">
In order to classify JCVs into semantic clusters, we
need to establish certain criteria. We define the
syntactic roles and semantic relations between
each constituent as criteria for classification into a
semantic cluster. Each constituent of a JCV has
syntactic roles such as dependency to a noun phrase
and suffix usage. We refer to any JCV component
verb that requires a complement as a main verb, and
any suffixing component as a subsidiary verb.
We also need to examine how the two verbs are
related each other within a JCV. The semantic
relation classes are assigned to the JCV constituents
respectively based on Tagashira’s (1986) study. As the
paraphrasing of V2 facilitates understanding of these
semantic relations, we investigate them by
paraphrasing.
The ambiguous JCVs were classified into three
types based on the syntactic roles of V2:
complementation, modification and directional
motion. In complementation, V2 plays a
complementary role to V1, and can be paraphrased
using other aspectual words such as hajimeru “start”
and owaru “finish”. In modification, the V2 modifies,
so we can paraphrase V2 with an adverb. Directional
motion consists of two main verbs. The V1 expresses
the manner of motion, and V2 the direction.
We describe the semantic relations of JCVs as
“SEM”, the syntactic roles of V1 as “SYN” and the
paraphrase as “PAR”, with examples as follows. The
symbol ‘/’ means “or”. The criteria for classification
into each semantic cluster are given in (3).

3 Analysis of JCVs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995125">
In order to build disambiguation rules which are
applicable to novel JCVs, we need to examine and
analyze frequency, types of semantic features and
co-occurring words of JCVs not in the dictionary.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999728">
3.1 Extraction of JCVs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931666666667">
We used data from the Mainichi Shinbun (Mainichi
1993) in order to examine JCVs not in the printed
dictionary (Kindaichi 1999). The newspaper articles
were tagged by the morphological analysis system
Chasen (Matsumoto et al. 2000). All occurrences of
“Verb-Verb” JCVs and non-compounded single
verbs were extracted from the tagged articles. Table
2 shows the number of tokens extracted and the
number of tokens after duplicates had been removed.

The “Verb-Verb” form accounts for only 1.36% of
the total tokens, however, this type accounts for
44.06% of types. In addition, 3525 words
(accounting for 65.71% of all “Verb-Verb” tokens)
are not registered in the dictionary. The result shows
a rich variety of JCVs and difficulty of processing
JCVs using a static dictionary. 829 types of
ambiguous JCVs, using of the 10 ambiguous V2s,
mentioned in 2.2, were found in the 3525 JCVs not
in the dictionary.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999232">
3.2 Semantic Features for Disambiguation of JCVs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996575">
The semantic features are necessary for
representing appropriate meanings of V1. We used
Ruigo Shin Jiten (Oono and Hamanishi 1989) to
label the semantic feature. The framework of the
semantic feature in Ruigo Shin Jiten provides
enough accuracy to distinguish the meaning of V1.
For instance, Ruigo Shin Jiten defines the semantic
feature of musu “steam” as suiji “kitchen work” and
that of nageru “throw” as dageki “throw and hit”.
These features can identify the different semantic
clusters of mushi-ageru “finish steaming” in the
aspectual cluster and nage-ageru “throw into the
air” in the spatial cluster. Ruigo Shin Jiten is
organized in three levels and constitutes 1000
categories. The labels from the second level, which
include 60 categories for verbs, are used in assigning
a semantic feature to V1. If it is difficult to identify
the meaning of V1 using the label from the second
level, the label from the third label is applied as the
semantic feature.

<sectionHeader confidence="0.843026" genericHeader="method">
4 Construction of Disambiguation Method
4.1 Information for Disambiguation Rules
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999416156862745">
We analyzed semantic features of all 328 V1s
among 829 target words. We examined ambiguities
of V1 based on the co-occurring nouns in a sentence
using the syntactic information in IPAL verb
dictionary (IPA 1987).
In order to construct disambiguation rules, we
took two steps. The first step was to disambiguate
the meaning of V1. The second step was to clarify
semantic and syntactic information for use in the
disambiguation rules.
As for the first step, we used the IPAL verb
dictionary. The IPAL verb dictionary defines the
meaning of verbs using valency patterns and assigns
a semantic feature from Ruigo Shin Jiten to each
entry.
Initially, the co-occurring nouns and verb
complements of JCVs were extracted from a
sentence. For the purpose of examining the
correlation between co-occurring nouns and V1, we
investigate the valency patterns of V1 in the IPAL
dictionary. For example, in the case of a sentence
like kare wa udon o uchi-ageta “He completed
making buckwheat noodle”, we try to find the
sub-entry of utsu “hit” having a complement such as
‘kare wa’ and ‘udon o’ in IPAL dictionary. When we
can identify the sub-entry of utsu “hit” which fulfills
this condition, a semantic label like seisan
“production” is selected as the semantic feature for
utsu “hit”.
The second step is to classify JCVs into
semantic clusters based on the criteria as defined in
2.3, and to extract commonalities of semantic
features on V1 within the same semantic cluster. For
example, JCVs such as yude-ageru “finish boiling”,
mushi-ageru “finish steaming” and yaki-ageru
“finish baking” classified into the aspectual cluster,
have a common semantic feature: suiji “house
keeping”.
Verb complements which are not related to V1
and their semantic features are used as syntactic
information in disambiguating the meaning of V2.
For instance, unazuku “nod” has a single meaning of
“agreement”. In combining unazuku “nod” with
kakeru “hang” as V2, unazuki-kakeru causes two
ambiguities. The first meaning is the aspectual
meaning such as kare wa sono kotoba ni
unazuki-kaketa “he was about to nod at what was
being said.” The second meaning is a spatial one
such as kare ni unazuki-kaketa “I nodded at him”. In
this case, we need semantic features and syntactic
information including verb complements.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98909">
4.2 Disambiguation Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99979480952381">
In order to construct of disambiguation rules, the
JCVs were classified into two groups using the
results of the analysis in section 4.1.
The rules of the first group are based on the
semantic features of V1. For example, utsu “hit” has
two meanings, “hit” and “make”. The semantic
feature of utsu “hit” in the first meaning is labeled as
dageli “hit and throw” in a specific context such as
kare wa bouru o uchi-ageta: “he hit the ball up”, and
classified in spatial cluster. The second meaning is
assigned suiji “cooking” as a semantic feature in a
sentence such as kare wa udon o uchi-ageta: “he
finished making buckwheat noodles”, and
categorized in aspectual cluster.
We built compounding rules for disambiguation
utilizing the semantic features of Ruigo Shin Jiten.
The rules are composed of the semantic features of
V1 and verb of V2 and the corresponding semantic
cluster.
Examples of these disambiguation rules are
shown as follows.

5 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996524">
The JCVs in Shin Meikai Kokugo dictionary were
selected for the evaluation of our rules, because the
meanings of JCVs can be judged objectively from
their definition. Before the evaluation procedure, we
categorized JCVs from the dictionary into idiomatic,
fused, high frequency and exception categories.
Idiomatic JCVs are those where the meaning of
the compound cannot be construed from the
meaning of two verbs independently. The meaning
of fused JCVs and high frequency JCVs can be
inferred from each constituent. Fused JCVs are those
which are used only in a specific context. High
frequency JCVs can be divided into two verbs
semantically and the case particle ‘te’ or ‘de’ can be
inserted between the two verbs in certain cases.
Exceptional JCVs are those with certain V2s such as
hajimeru “start” and tsuzukeru “continue” which can
be processed easily using only the definition of V2.
Since idiomatic and fused JCVs cannot be
processed by our method, registering such JCVs in
the dictionary is a reasonable approach for computer
implementation. Exceptions may also be registered
in the dictionary. However, all high frequency JCVs
can be treated with our method and are designated as
target words for evaluation.

cluster, their dictionary definitions must include
words related to some semantic cluster, such as
owaru “finish” in the case of the aspectual cluster,

5.2 Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.999993162162162">
As a result of the evaluation, 31 errors are observed.
These errors can be divided into three types,
corresponding to the lack of rules, the problem of
semantic features and exceptions. Lack of rules
including the semantic features of V1 and V2 has not
yet been registered in our rules.
The second problem occurs where semantic
features cannot be assigned to V1 appropriately. For
instance, koneru “knead” is assigned hendo
“fluctuation” as the semantic feature of V1, but the
verb means motion for making something. The
difference between hendo “fluctuation” and seisan
“production” is important in identifying the semantic
cluster, because kone-ageru “complete kneading” is
in the aspectual cluster, but maki-ageru “roll up” is
assigned the semantic feature of “fluctuation” in the
spatial cluster. We consider that such verbs should
be rearranged in an appropriate framework.
The errors classified as exceptions are those
where an unusual usage of V1 causes the wrong
cluster to be selected by our rules. For example,
moeru “burn” used in moe-agaru “flare up” is
assigned bussho “physical phenomena” as its
semantic feature. Moe-agaru “flare up” should be
regarded as spatial cluster, because of its dictionary
definition that something burns with rising flames.
However, a JCV with a V1 of bussho “physical
phenomena” and V2 of agaru “go up” is classified
into the aspectual cluster by our rules, similarly to
waki-agaru “boil up” and atatame-ageru “finish
heating”. Moe-agaru “flare up” should be registered
in the dictionary as an exception.
The accuracy of our rules is improved up to
nearly 99% by the addition of 10 rules for 19 verbs
and by rearranging the semantic features of 8 verbs.
The result confirms the advantage of our method for
disambiguating JCVs.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

<bodyText confidence="0.999850615384615">
We proposed a disambiguation method for JCVs
based on disambiguation rules which make use of
the semantic features of each constituent. We also
clarified the characteristics of, and problems for, a
treatment of JCVs. The obtained accuracy is
87.19% for our rules. This result shows the
advantage of our method.
The disambiguation rules will be enhanced by
analyzing the rest of the ambiguous V2 verbs shown
in 2.3. This will complete our method for
disambiguation. We will try to apply our method to
a machine translation system, comparing the results
of our study with a study of phrasal verbs in English.

Japanese has diverse types of MWEs and there are difficulties in processing them (Baldwin and Bond 2002). In those studies, MWEs are defined as a “word with spaces” in English and “idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries” in Japanese. Verb particles as one type of MWE in English have been studied (Villavicencio and Copestake 2002). We predict that verb particles in English and compound verbs in Japanese have commonalities in terms of ambiguity and semantic constraints. For example, the English particle “up” has both an aspectual (“finish up writing” cf. “kaki-owaru”) and a spatial meaning (“go up the stairs” cf. “kake-agaru”), which is equivalent to the second verb in Japanese c</context>

We identify the meaning of such JCVs using syntactic information gained from co-occurrence and verb complements. 2.2 Ambiguities of V2 We classified ambiguities of V2 into three semantic clusters: aspectual, spatial and adverbial (Niimi 1987). An ambiguous V2 is defined as a word with multiple meanings which overlap several semantic clusters. This framework makes it easier to distinguish the difference in meaning for an ambiguous V2. We listed all the ambiguous V2, i.e. the following 20 words, based on the previous study (Himeno 2001). agaru “go up”, ageru “lift”, otosu “drop”, kakeru “hang”, kakaru “hang onto”, kaeru “go back”, kaesu “send back”, iru “enter”, komu “insert”, sugiru “go past”, tatsu “stand”, tateru “make stand”, tsuku “be attached”, tsukeru “attach”, dasu “put out”, kiru “cut”, toosu “pierce”, nuku “pull out”, tobasu “scatter”, wataru “go across” For the first step of analysis, we extracted 10 ambiguous words at random, agaru “go up”, ageru “lift”, otosu “drop”, kakeru “hang”, kakaru “hang onto”, kaeru “go back”, kaesu “send back”, iru “enter”, komu “insert” and sugiru “go past”.

The labels from the second level, which include 60 categories for verbs, are used in assigning a semantic feature to V1. If it is difficult to identify the meaning of V1 using the label from the second level, the label from the third label is applied as the semantic feature. 4 Construction of Disambiguation Method 4.1 Information for Disambiguation Rules We analyzed semantic features of all 328 V1s among 829 target words. We examined ambiguities of V1 based on the co-occurring nouns in a sentence using the syntactic information in IPAL verb dictionary (IPA 1987). In order to construct disambiguation rules, we took two steps. The first step was to disambiguate the meaning of V1. The second step was to clarify semantic and syntactic information for use in the disambiguation rules. As for the first step, we used the IPAL verb dictionary. The IPAL verb dictionary defines the meaning of verbs using valency patterns and assigns a semantic feature from Ruigo Shin Jiten to each entry. Initially, the co-occurring nouns and verb complements of JCVs were extracted from a sentence. For the purpose of examining the correlation between co-occurring nouns and V1, w</context>

There are a small number of such ambiguous verbs which appear as V2. Ambiguous JCVs are generated by compounding various instances of V1 with an ambiguous V2, which makes it difficult to process on computer. The analysis of JCVs has been discussed in the field of linguistics and natural language processing. In linguistics, JCVs have been studied mainly in terms of syntax (Kageyama 1999) and constraints on semantic structures (Matsumoto 1996, 1998).

However, she confounded the meaning of V1 with that of V2 in her classification. In order to clarify the semantic constraints between V1 and V2, we need to analyze each constituent individually.

In addition, 3525 words (accounting for 65.71% of all “Verb-Verb” tokens) are not registered in the dictionary. The result shows a rich variety of JCVs and difficulty of processing JCVs using a static dictionary. 829 types of ambiguous JCVs, using of the 10 ambiguous V2s, mentioned in 2.2, were found in the 3525 JCVs not in the dictionary. 3.2 Semantic Features for Disambiguation of JCVs The semantic features are necessary for representing appropriate meanings of V1. We used Ruigo Shin Jiten (Oono and Hamanishi 1989) to label the semantic feature. The framework of the semantic feature in Ruigo Shin Jiten provides enough accuracy to distinguish the meaning of V1. For instance, Ruigo Shin Jiten defines the semantic feature of musu “steam” as suiji “kitchen work” and that of nageru “throw” as dageki “throw and hit”. These features can identify the different semantic clusters of mushi-ageru “finish steaming” in the aspectual cluster and nage-ageru “throw into the air” in the spatial cluster.

We predict that verb particles in English and compound verbs in Japanese have commonalities in terms of ambiguity and semantic constraints. For example, the English particle “up” has both an aspectual (“finish up writing” cf. “kaki-owaru”) and a spatial meaning (“go up the stairs” cf. “kake-agaru”), which is equivalent to the second verb in Japanese compound verbs. We investigate Japanese compound verbs (JCVs) and extract semantic constraints for the purpose of applying them to machine translation. JCVs consist of two verbs, the first verb (V1) and the second verb (V2). V1 always appears in </context>

The second step is to classify JCVs into semantic clusters and extract commonalities of semantic features on V1 (semantic information) and verb complements (syntactic information). We build rules using this obtained semantic and syntactic information. This is the major innovation of this study. The proposed method based on disambiguation rules has the advantage of being able to analyze new compound verbs not in the dictionary. Since the semantic restrictions of JCVs are similar to those of phrasal verbs in English (Villavicencio and Copestake 2002), there might be a possibility of applying our method to machine translation. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the definition, ambiguities and semantic relations of JCVs. Section 3 shows analysis results. The semantic analysis method is explained in Section 4. The evaluation of this method is discussed in Section 5. The conclusion of our study and implication for future work are stated at the end. 2 Ambiguities of JCVs 2.1 Types of Ambiguities Kageyama (1993) has proposed that JCVs can be analyzed by the argument structure of each constituent and divided into</context>
