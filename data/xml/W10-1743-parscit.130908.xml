UPV-PRHLT participated in the System
Combination task of the Fifth Workshop
on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT
2010). On each translation direction, all
the submitted systems were combined into
a consensus translation. These consen-
sus translations always improve transla-
tion quality of the best individual system.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999115">
The UPV-PRHLT approach to MT system combi-
nation is based on a refined version of the algo-
rithm described in (Gonz´alez-Rubio and Casacu-
berta, 2010), with additional information to cope
with hypotheses of different quality.
In contrast to most of the previous approaches
to combine the outputs of multiple MT sys-
tems (Bangalore et al., 2001; Jayaraman and
Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al., 2006; Schroeder et
al., 2009), which are variations over the ROVER
voting scheme (Fiscus, 1997), we consider the
problem of computing a consensus translation as
the problem of modelling a set of string patterns
with an adequate prototype. Under this frame-
work, the translation hypotheses of each of the
MT systems are considered as individual patterns
in a set of string patterns. The (generalised) me-
dian string, which is the optimal prototype of a set
of strings (Fu, 1982), is the chosen prototype to
model the set of strings.

The median string of a set is defined as the string
that minimises the sum of distances to the strings
in the set. Therefore, defining a distance between
strings is the primary problem to deal with.
The most common definition of distance be-
tween two strings is the Levenshtein distance,
also known as edit distance (ED). This metric
computes the optimal sequence of edit operations
(insertions, deletions and substitutions of words)
needed to transform one string into the other. The
main problem with the ED is its dependence on the
length of the compared strings. This fact led to the
definition of a new distance whose value is inde-
pendent from the length of the strings compared.
This normalised edit distance (NED) (Vidal et al.,
1995) is computed by averaging the number of edit
operations by the length of the edit path. The ex-
perimentation in this work was carried out using
the NED.

2.1 Median String
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997105">
Given a set E = e1,. . . , en, ... , eN of translation
hypotheses from N MT systems, let E be the vo-
cabulary in the target language and E∗ be the free
monoid over that vocabulary (E C_ E∗). The me-
dian string of the set E (noted as M(E)) can be
formally defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.857382">
[wn - D(e′, en)] , (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999824071428572">
where D is the distance used to compare two
strings and the value wn, 1 &lt; n &lt; N weights
the contribution of the hypothesis n to the sum of
distances, and therefore, it denotes the significance
of hypothesis n in the computation of the median
string. The value wn can be seen as a measure of
the “quality” of hypothesis n.
Computing the median string is a NP-Hard
problem (de la Higuera and Casacuberta, 2000),
therefore we can only build approximations to the
median string by using several heuristics. In this
work, we follow two different approximations: the
set median string (Fu, 1982) and the approximate
median string (Martinez et al., 2000).

2.2 Set Median String
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99947275">
The most straightforward approximation to the
median string corresponds to the search of a set
median string. Under this approximation, the
search is constrained to the strings in the given in-
put set. The set median string can be informally
defined as the most “centred” string in the set. The
set median string of the set E (noted as M,(E))
is given by:

The set median string can be computed in poly-
nomial time (Fu, 1982; Juan and Vidal, 1998).
Unfortunately, in some cases, the set median may
not be a good approximation to the median string.
For example, in the extreme case of a set of two
strings, either achieves the minimum accumulated
distance to the set. However, the set median string
is a useful initialisation in the computation of the
approximate median string.

2.3 Approximate Median String
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986627607142857">
A good approximation to efficiently compute the
median string is proposed in (Martinez et al.,
2000). To compute the approximate median string
of the set E, the algorithm starts with an initial
string e which is improved by successive refine-
ments in an iterative process. This iterative pro-
cess is based on the application of different edit
operations over each position of the string e look-
ing for a reduction of the accumulated distance to
the strings in the set. Algorithm 1 describes this
iterative process.
The initial string can be a random string or
a string computed from the set E. Martinez et
al. (2000) proposed two kinds of initial strings: the
set median string of E and a string computed by a
greedy algorithm, both of them obtained similar
results. In this work, we start with the set median
string in the initialisation of the computation of the
approximate median string of the set E. Over this
initial string we apply the iterative procedure de-
scribed in Algorithm 1 until there is no improve-
ment. The final median string may be different
from the original hypotheses.
The computational time cost of Algorithm 1 is
linear with the number of hypotheses in the com-
bination, and usually only a moderate number of
iterations is needed to converge.
For each position i in the string e:

Substitution: Make x = e. For each word a E E:
• Make x′ the result string of substituting the ith
word of x by a.
• If the accumulated distance of x′ to E is lower
than the accumulated distance from x to E, then
make x = x′.
Deletion: Make y the result string of deleting the ith
word of e.
Insertion: Make z = e. For each word a E E:
• Make z′ the result of inserting a at position i of
e.
• If the accumulated distance from z′ to E is lower
than the accumulated distance from z to E, then
make z = z′.
2. Choose an alternative:
• From the set {e, x, y, z} take the string e′ with
less accumulated distance to E. Make e = e′.

3 Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976181818182">
Experiments were conducted on all the 8 transla-
tion directions cz—*en, en—*cz, de—*en, en—*de,
es—*en, en—*es, fr—*en and en—*fr. Some of the
entrants to the shared translation task submit lists
of n-best translations, but, in our experience, if a
large number of systems is available, using n-best
translations does not allow to obtain better consen-
sus translations than using single best translations,
but raises computation time significantly. Conse-
quently, we compute consensus translations only
using the single best translation of each individ-
ual MT system. Table 1 shows the number of sys-
tems submitted and gives an overview of the test
corpus on each translation direction. The number
of running words is the average number of run-
ning words in the test corpora, from where the
consensus translations were computed; the vocab-
ulary is the merged vocabulary of these test cor-
pora. All the experiments were carried out with
the true-cased, detokenised version of the tuning
and test corpora, following the WMT 2010 sub-
mission guidelines.

3.2 Weighted Sum of Distances
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998062">
In section 2, we define the median string of a set
as the string which minimises a weighted sum of
distances to the strings in the set (Eq. (1)). The
weights wn in the sum can be tuned. We compute
a weight value for each MT system as a whole, i.e.
all the hypotheses of a given MT system share the
same weight value. We study the performance of
different sets of weight looking for improvements
in the quality of the consensus translations. These
weight values are derived from different automatic
MT evaluation measures:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.93349175">
• BLEU score of each system.
• 1.0 minus TER score of each system.
• Number of times the hypothesis of each sys-
tem is the best TER-scoring translation.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916714285714">
We estimate these scores on the tuning corpora.
A normalisation is performed to transform these
scores into the range [0.0, 1.0]. After the normal-
isation, a weight value of 0.0 is assigned to the
lowest-scoring hypothesis, i.e. the lowest-scoring
hypothesis is not taking into account in the com-
putation of the median string.

3.3 System Combination Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994937254902">
Our framework to compute consensus translations
allows multiple combinations varying the median
string algorithm or the set of weight values used
in the weighted sum of distances. To assure the
soundness of our submission to the WMT 2010
system combination task, the experiments on the
tuning corpora were carried out in a leaving-one-
out fashion dividing the tuning data into 5 parts
and averaging translation results over these 5 par-
titions. On each of the experiments, 4 of the par-
titions are devoted to obtain the weight values for
the weighted sum of distances while BLEU and
TER scores are calculated on the consensus trans-
lations of the remaining partition.
Table 2 shows, on each translation direction,
the performance of the consensus translations on
the tuning corpora. The consensus translations
were computed with the set median string and the
approximated median string using different sets
of weight values: Uniform, all weights are set
to 1.0, BLEU-based weights, TER-based weights
and oracle-based weights. In addition, we display
the performance of the best of the individual MT
systems for comparison purposes. The number of
MT systems combined for each translation direc-
tion is displayed between parentheses.
On all the translation directions under study, the
consensus translations improved the results of the
best individual systems. E.g. TER improved from
66.0 to 63.3 when translating from German into
English. On average, the set median strings per-
formed better than the best individual system, but
its results were always below the performance of
the approximate median string. The use of weight
values computed from MT quality measures al-
lows to improve the quality of the consensus trans-
lation computed. Specially, oracle-based weight
values that, except for the cz—*en task, always per-
form equal or better than the other sets of weight
values. We have observed that no improvements
can be achieved with uniform weight values; it is
necessary to penalise low quality hypotheses.
To compute our primary submission to the
WMT 2010 system combination task we choose
the configurations that obtain consensus transla-
tions with highest BLEU score on the tuning cor-
pora. The approximate median string using oracle-
based scores is the chosen configuration for all
translation directions, except on the cz—*en trans-
lation direction for which TER-based weights per-
formed better. As our secondary submission we

We compute MT quality scores on the WMT
2010 test corpora to verify the results on the tuning
data. Table 3 displays, on each translation direc-
tion, the results on the test corpora of our primary
and secondary submissions and of the best indi-
vidual system. These results confirm the results
on the tuning data. On all translation directions,
our submissions perform better than the best indi-
vidual systems as measured by BLEU and TER.
We have studied the performance of two consen-
sus translation algorithms that based in the compu-
tation of two different approximations to the me-
dian string. Our algorithms use a weighted sum of
distances whose weight values can be tuned. We
show that using weight values derived from auto-
matic MT quality measures computed on the tun-
ing corpora allow to improve the performance of
the best individual system on all the translation di-
rections under study.

In contrast to most of the previous approaches to combine the outputs of multiple MT systems (Bangalore et al., 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al., 2006; Schroeder et al., 2009), which are variations over the ROVER voting scheme (Fiscus, 1997), we consider the problem of computing a consensus translation as the problem of modelling a set of string patterns with an adequate prototype. Under this framework, the translation hypotheses of each of the MT systems are considered as individual patterns in a set of string patterns. The (generalised) median string, which is the optimal prototype of a set of strings (Fu, 1982), is the chosen prototype to model the set of strings. 2 System Combination Algo</context>

The set median string of the set E (noted as M,(E)) is given by: [wn - D(e′, en)] . (2) The set median string can be computed in polynomial time (Fu, 1982; Juan and Vidal, 1998). Unfortunately, in some cases, the set median may not be a good approximation to the median string. For example, in the extreme case of a set of two strings, either achieves the minimum accumulated distance to the set. However, the set median string is a useful initialisation in the computation of the approximate median string. 2.3 Approximate Median String A good approximation to efficiently compute the median string is proposed in (Martinez et al., 2000).

To compute the approximate median string of the set E, the algorithm starts with an initial string e which is improved by successive refinements in an iterative process. This iterative process is based on the application of different edit operations over each position of the string e looking for a reduction of the accumulated distance to the strings in the set. Algorithm 1 describes this iterative process. The initial string can be a random string or a string computed from the set E. Martinez et al. (2000) proposed two kinds of initial strings: the set median string of E and a string computed by a greedy algorithm, both of them obtained similar results. In this work, we start with the set median string in the initialisation of the computation of the approximate median string of the set E. Over this initial string we apply the iterative procedure described in Algorithm 1 until there is no improvement. The final median string may be different from the original hypotheses. The computational time cost of Algorithm 1 is linear with the number of hypotheses in the combination, and usually only a mode</context>

This metric computes the optimal sequence of edit operations (insertions, deletions and substitutions of words) needed to transform one string into the other. The main problem with the ED is its dependence on the length of the compared strings. This fact led to the definition of a new distance whose value is independent from the length of the strings compared. This normalised edit distance (NED) (Vidal et al., 1995) is computed by averaging the number of edit operations by the length of the edit path.
