This paper compares the consistency-

in &apos;unification-based&apos; grammars with an
implication-based account based on a sim-
ple feature extension to Lambek Catego-
rial Grammar (LCG). We show that the
LCG treatment accounts for constructions

This paper contrasts the treatment of agreement
phenomena in standard complex feature structure
or &apos;unification-based&apos; grammars such as HPSG (Pol-
lard and Sag, 1994) with that of perhaps the sim-
plest possible feature extension to Lambek Catego-
rial Grammar (LCG) (Lambek, 1958). We iden-
tify a number of situations where the two accounts
make different predictions, and find that gener-
ally the LCG account is superior. In the pro-
cess we provide analyses for a number of construc-
tions that have been recognized as problematic for
&apos;unification-based&apos; accounts of agreements (Zaenen
and Karttunen, 1984; Pullum and Zwicky, 1986; In-
gria, 1990). Our account builds on the analysis of
coordination in applicative categorial grammar in
Bayer (1994) and the treatment of Boolean connec-
tives in LCG provided by Morrill (1992). Our anal-
ysis is similiar to that proposed by Mineur (1993),
but differs both in its application and details.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The
next section describes the version of LCG we use in
this paper; for reasons of space we assume familiar-
ity with the treatment of agreement in &apos;unification-
based&apos; grammars, see Shieber (1986) and Pollard
and Sag (1994) for details. Then each of the follow-

In LCG semantic interpretation and long distance
dependencies are handled independently of the fea-
ture system, so agreement phenomena seem to be
the major application of a feature system for LCG.
Since only a finite number of feature distinctions
need to be made in all the cases of agreement we
know of, we posit only a very simple feature system
here. Roughly speaking, features will be treated as
atomic propositions (we have no need to separate
them into attributes and values), and a simple cat-
egory will be a Boolean combination of such atomic
&apos;features&apos; (since we have no reason to posit a re-
cursive feature structures either). In fact we are
agnostic as to whether more complex feature sys-
tems for LCG are linguistically justified; in any event
Dorre et. al. (1994) show how a full attribute-value
feature structure system having the properties de-
scribed here can be incorporated into LCG.
Following the standard formulation of LCG, we
regard the standard LCG connectives `/&apos; and&apos;\&apos; as
directed implications, so we construct our system so
that a/18 0&apos; can combine to form a if /3&apos; is logically
stronger than (3.
Formally, we adopt Morrill&apos;s treatment (Morrill,
1992) of the (semantically impotent) Boolean con-
nectives &apos;A&apos; and V (Morrill named these and &apos;LI&apos;
respectively). Given a set of atomic features F, we
define the set of feature terms &apos;T and categories C
as follows, where `/&apos; and `V are the standard LCG
forward and backward implication operators.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99975">
&apos;T ::= + T AT + Tyr
C ::= T CIC C\C

<bodyText confidence="0.999172">
In general, atomic categories in a standard catego-
rial grammar will be replaced in our analyses with
formulae drawn from T. For example, the NP Kim
might be assigned by the lexicon to the category
npAsgA3, the verb sleeps to the category s\npAsgA3,

and the verb slept (which does not impose person
or number features on its subject) to the category
s\np.
To simplify the presentation of the proofs, we for-
mulate our system in natural deduction terms, and
specify the properties of the Boolean connectives us-
ing the single inference rule P, rather than providing
separate rules for each connective.
—P where 0 I- 7,b in the propositional calculus.1
The rule P allows us to replace any formula in T
with a logically weaker one. For example, since Kim
is assigned to the category npAsgA3, then by rule P
it will belong to np as well.
Finally, we assume the standard LCG introduc-
tion and elimination rules for the directed implica-
tion operators.

This example brings out one of the fundamental dif-
ferences between the standard treatment of agree-
ment in &apos;unification-based&apos; grammar and this treat-
ment of agreement in LCG. In the &apos;unification-based&apos;
accounts agreement is generally a symmetric rela-
tionship between the agreeing constituents: both
agreeing constituents impose constraints on a shared
agreement value, and the construction is well-formed
if these constraints are consistent.
However, in the LCG treatment of agreement pro-
posed here agreement is inherently asymmetric, in
&apos;Because conjunction and disjunction are the only
connectives we permit, it does not matter whether we
use the classical or intuitionistic propositional calcu-
lus here. In fact, if categories such as np and op are
&apos;decomposed&apos; into the conjunctions of atomic features
+nourin—verb and +nounn-l-verb respectively as in the
Sag et. al. (1985) analysis discussed below, disjunction
is not required in any of the LCG analyses below. How-
ever, Bayer (1994) argues that such a decomposition is
not always plausible.
that an argument must logically imply, or be sub-
sumed by, the antecedent of the predicate it com-
bines with. Thus in the example above, the rule
P could be used to &apos;weaken&apos; the argument from
npAsgA3 to np, but it would not allow rip (with-
out agreement features) to be &apos;strengthened&apos; to, say,
npAsgA3.
Abstracting from the details of the feature sys-
tems, we can characterize the &apos;unification-based&apos; ap-
proach as one in which agreement is possible be-
tween two constituents with feature specifications 0
and tk if 0 and tk are consistent, whereas the LCG
approach requires that the argument 0 implies the
corresponding antecedent of the predicate (i.e.,
0)•
Interestingly, in cases where features are fully
specified, these subsumption and consistency re-
quirements are equivalent. More precisely, say that
a formula 0 from a feature constraint language fixes
an atomic feature constraint x if x or 0 k
For example, in single-valued feature systems
(person) = 1 and (person) = 3 both fix (person) =1,
(person) = 2, (person) = 3, etc., and in general all
fully-specified agreement constraints fix the same set
of formulae.
Now let 0 and lk be two satisfiable formulae that
fix the same set of atomic feature constraints. Then
0 A 0 is consistent if i,/). To see this, note
that because 0 and ik fix the same set of formulae,
each condition holds if 0 and &amp; are elementarily
equivalent (i.e., for each feature constraint x, x
iff X).
However, the role of partial agreement feature
specifications in the two systems is very different.
The following sections explore the empirical conse-
quences of these two approaches. We focus on co-
ordination phenomena because this is the one area
of the grammar where underspecified agreement fea-
tures seem to play a crucial linguistic role, and can-
not be regarded merely as an abbreviatory device for
a disjunction of fully-specified agreement values.

3 Coordination and agreement
asymmetries

<bodyText confidence="0.999951">
Interestingly, the analysis of coordination is the one
place where most &apos;unification-based&apos; accounts aban-
don the symmetric consistency-based treatment of
agreement and adopt an asymmetric subsumption-
based account. Working in the GPSG framework
Sag et. al. (1985) proposed that the features on
a conjunction must be the most specific category
which subsumes each conjunct (called the general-
ization by Shieber (1992)). Shieber (1986) proposed
a weaker condition, namely that the features on the
conjunction must subsume the features on each con-
junct, as expressed in the annotated phrase struc-

ture rule below (Shieber, 1992).2 In all of the exam-

a conjunction is the generalization of the features
associated with each of its conjuncts, so our conclu-
sions are equally valid for both the generalization
and subsumption accounts of coordination.

Consider the sentences in (2). Decomposing the cat-

valued features {(noun) = (verb) = —} and
{(noun) = +, (verb) = +} respectively, the fact that
became can select for either an NP or an AP comple-
ment (2a) can be captured by analysing it as subcat-
egorizing for a complement whose category is under-
specified; i.e., its complement satisfies (noun) = -F,

Now consider the coordination in (2b). Assum-
ing that became selects the underspecified category
(noun) = -I-, the features associated with the coor-
dination subsume the features associated with each
coordinate, as required by rule (1), so (213) has the
well-formed structure shown in Figure 1.
On the other hand, a verb such as grew which
selects solely AP complements (3a) requires that
its complement satisfies (noun) = +, (verb) = -F.
Thus the features on the coordinate structure in (3b)
must include (verb) = + and so do not subsume the
(verb) = — feature on the NP complement, correctly
predicting the ungrammaticality of (3b).

Our LCG account analyses these constructions in
a similar way. Because the LCG account of agree-
ment has subsumption &apos;built in&apos;, the coordination
rule merely requires identity of the conjunction and
each of the conjuncts.

We provide an LCG derivation of (213) in Fig-
ure 2. Roughly speaking, rule P allows both the
AP wealthy and the NP a Republican to &apos;weaken&apos; to
npvap, so the conjunction satisfies the antecedent of
the predicate became. (This weakening also takes
place in non-coordination examples such as Kim be-
came wealthy). On the other hand, (3b) is correctly
predicted to be ill-formed because the strongest pos-
sible category for the coordination is npvap, but this
does not imply the &apos;stronger&apos; ap antecedent of grew,
so the derivation in Figure 3 cannot proceed to form
a vp.
Thus on these examples, the feature-based sub-
sumption account and the LCG of complement co-
ordination constructions impose similiar feature con-
straints; they both require that the predicate&apos;s fea-
ture specification of the complement subsumes the
features of each of the arguments. In the feature-
based account, this is because the features associ-
ated with a conjunction must subsume the features

3This condition in effect makes conjunctions into is-
lands. Morrill (1992) shows how such island constraints

associated with each conjunct, while in the LCG ac-
count the features associated with the complement
specification in a predicate must subsume those as-
sociated with the complement itself.
Now consider the related construction in (4) in-
volving conjoined predicates as well conjoined argu-
ments. Similar constructions, and their relevance
to the GPSG treatment of coordination, were first
discussed by Jacobson (1987). In such cases, the
feature-based subsumption account requires that the
features associated with the predicate conjunction
subsume those associated with each predicate con-
junct. This is possible, as shown in Figure 4. Thus
the feature structure subsumption account incor-
rectly predicts the well-formedness of (4).
(4) *Kim [ grew and remained ] [ wealthy and a
Republican].
Because the subsumption constraint in the LCG
analysis is associated with the predicate-argument
relationship (rather than the coordination construc-
tion, as in the feature-based subsumption account),
an LCG analysis paralleling the one given in Figure 4
does not exist. By introducing and withdrawing a
hypothetical ap constituent as shown in Figure 5 it
is possible to conjoin grew and remained, but the re-
sulting conjunction belongs to the category vplap,
and cannot combine with the wealthy and a Repub-
lican, which belongs to the category npvap.
Informally, while rule P allows the features associ-
ated with an argument to be weakened, together with
the introduction and elimination rules it permits the
argument specifications of predicates to be strength-
ened (c.f. the subproof showing that remained be-
longs to category vplap in Figure 5). As we re-
marked earlier, in LCG predicates are analysed as
(directed) implicational formulae, and the argument
features required by a predicate appear in the an-
tecedent of such formulae. Since strengthening the
antecedent of an implication weakens the implica-
tion as a whole, the combined effect of rule P and
the introduction and elimination rules is to permit
the overall weakening of a category.

4 Consistency and agreement
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976">
Complex feature structure analyses of agreement
require that certain combinations of feature con-
straints are inconsistent in order to correctly reflect
agreement failure. For example, the agreement fail-
ure in him runs is reflected in the inconsistency of the
constraints (case) . acc and (case) = nom. In the
LCG account presented above, the agreement fail-
ure in him runs is reflected by the failure of acc to
imply nom, not by the inconsistency of the features
acc and nom. Thus in LCG there is no principled
reason not to assign a category an apparently con-
tradictory feature specification such as npnnomnacc
(this might be a reasonable lexical category assign-
ment for an NP such as Kim).

Consider the German examples in (5), cited by
Pullum and Zwicky (1986) and Ingria (1990). These

dative complement (5b), it can combine with the NP
Frauen (5c), which can appear in both accusative

Contrary to the claim by Ingria (1990), these exam-
ples can be accounted for straight-forwardly using
the standard feature subsumption-based account of
coordination. Now, this account presupposes the ex-
istence of appropriate underspecified categories (e.g.,
in the English example above it was crucial that ma-
jor category labels were decomposed into the fea-
tures noun and verb). Similarly, we decompose the
four nominal cases in German into the `subcase&apos; fea-
tures obj (abbreviating &apos;objective&apos;) and dir (for &apos;di-
rect&apos;) as follows.

As in the previous example, the LCG approach
does not require the case feature to be decom-
posed. However, as shown in Figure 7 it does as-
sign the conjunction findet und hilft to the cat-
egory vp/npnaccAdat; hence the analysis requires
that Frauen be assigned to the &apos;inconsistent&apos; cat-
egory npnaccAdat. Such overspecified or &apos;inconsis-
tent&apos; features may seem ad hoc and unmotivated,
but they arise naturally in the formal framework of
Morrill&apos;s extended LCG.
In fact, they seem to be necessary to obtain a
linguistically correct description of coordination in
German. Consider the ungrammatical &apos;double coor-
dination&apos; example in (6). Both the feature structure
generalization and subsumption accounts incorrectly
predict it to be well-formed, as shown in Figure 8.

However, the LCG analysis systematically distin-
guishes between Frau en, which is assigned to the cat-
egory npnaccAdat, and Mdnner und Kindern, which
is assigned to the weaker category npn(accvdat).
Thus the LCG analysis correctly predicts (6) to
be ungrammatical, as shown in Figure 9. The
distinction between the categories ripnaccAdat and
npn(accvdat), and hence the existence of the appar-
ently inconsistent categories, seems to be crucial to
the ability to distinguish between the grammatical
(5c) and the ungrammatical (6).

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942304347826">
This paper has examined some of the differences
between a standard complex feature-structure ac-
count of agreement, which is fundamentally orga-
nized around a notion of consistency, and an ac-
count in an extended version of LCG, in which agree-
ment is fundamentally an asymmetric relationship.
We have attempted to show that the LCG account
of agreement correctly treats a number of cases of
coordination which are problematic for the stan-
dard feature-based account. Although we have not
shown this here, the LCG account extends straight-
forwardly to the cases of coordination and morpho-
logical neutralization discussed by Zaenen and Kar-
tunen (1984), Pullum and Zwicky (1986) and In-
gria (1990).
The nature of an appropriate feature system for
LCG is still an open question. It is perhaps surpris-
ing that the simple feature system proposed here
can handle such complex linguistic phenomena, but
additional mechanisms might be required to treat
other linguistic constructions. The standard account
of adverbial modification in standard LCG, for in-
stance, treats adverbs as functors. Because the verb

heading an adverbial modified VP agrees in number
with its subject, the same number features will have
to appear in both the antecedent and consequent of
the adverb. Using the LCG account described above
it is necessary to treat adverbs as ambiguous, assign-
ing them to the categories (s\npAsg)Vs\npAsg) and
(s\npAp1)\(s\npApl).
There are several approaches which may eliminate
the need for such systematic ambiguity. First, if the
language of (category) types is extended to permit
universally quantified types as suggested by Mor-
rill (Morrill, 1992), then adverbs could be assigned
to the single type

Second, it might be possible to reanalyse adjunction
in such a way that avoids the problem altogether.
For example, Bouma and van Noord (1994) show
that assuming that heads subcategorize for adjuncts
(rather than the other way around, as is standard)
permits a particularly elegant account of the double
infinitive construction in Dutch. If adjuncts in gen-
eral are treated as arguments of the head, then the
&apos;problem&apos; of &apos;passing features&apos; through adjunction
disappears.
The comparative computational complexity of
both the unification-based approach and the LCG
accounts is also of interest. Despite their simplic-
ity, the computational complexity of the kinds of
feature-structure and LCG grammars discussed here
is largely unknown. Dorre et. al. (1992) showed
that the satisfiability problem for systems of feature-
structure subsumption and equality constraints is
undecidable, but it is not clear if such problems
can arise in the kinds of feature-structure gram-
mars discussed above. Conversely, while terminat-
ing (Gentzen) proof procedures are available for ex-
tended LCG systems of the kind we presented here,
none of these handle the coordination schema, and
as far as we are aware the computational proper-
ties of systems which include this schema are largely
unexplored.

We have attempted to show that the LCG account of agreement correctly treats a number of cases of coordination which are problematic for the standard feature-based account. Although we have not shown this here, the LCG account extends straightforwardly to the cases of coordination and morphological neutralization discussed by Zaenen and Kartunen (1984), Pullum and Zwicky (1986) and Ingria (1990). The nature of an appropriate feature system for LCG is still an open question. It is perhaps surprising that the simple feature system proposed here can handle such complex linguistic phenomena, but additional mechanisms might be required to treat other linguistic constructions.

There are several approaches which may eliminate the need for such systematic ambiguity. First, if the language of (category) types is extended to permit universally quantified types as suggested by Morrill (Morrill, 1992), then adverbs could be assigned to the single type V X .((s\np A X )\(s\ npn X)).

<context position="1128" citStr="Pullum and Zwicky, 1986" startWordPosition="162" endWordPosition="165">n This paper contrasts the treatment of agreement phenomena in standard complex feature structure or &apos;unification-based&apos; grammars such as HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) with that of perhaps the simplest possible feature extension to Lambek Categorial Grammar (LCG) (Lambek, 1958). We identify a number of situations where the two accounts make different predictions, and find that generally the LCG account is superior. In the process we provide analyses for a number of constructions that have been recognized as problematic for &apos;unification-based&apos; accounts of agreements (Zaenen and Karttunen, 1984; Pullum and Zwicky, 1986; Ingria, 1990). Our account builds on the analysis of coordination in applicative categorial grammar in Bayer (1994) and the treatment of Boolean connectives in LCG provided by Morrill (1992). Our analysis is similiar to that proposed by Mineur (1993), but differs both in its application and details. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the version of LCG we use in this paper; for reasons of space we assume familiarity with the treatment of agreement in &apos;unificationbased&apos; grammars, see Shieber (1986) and Pollard and Sag (1994) for details.

In the LCG account presented above, the agreement failure in him runs is reflected by the failure of acc to imply nom, not by the inconsistency of the features acc and nom. Thus in LCG there is no principled reason not to assign a category an apparently contradictory feature specification such as npnnomnacc (this might be a reasonable lexical category assignment for an NP such as Kim).

Consider the German examples in (5), cited by Pullum and Zwicky (1986) and Ingria (1990). These examples show that while the conjunction findet und hilft cannot take either a purely accusative (5a) or dative complement (5b), it can combine with the NP Frauen (5c), which can appear in both accusative and dative contexts.

We have attempted to show that the LCG account of agreement correctly treats a number of cases of coordination which are problematic for the standard feature-based account. Although we have not shown this here, the LCG account extends straightforwardly to the cases of coordination and morphological neutralization discussed by Zaenen and Kartunen (1984), Pullum and Zwicky (1986) and Ingria (1990). The nature of an appropriate feature system for LCG is still an open question. It is perhaps surprising that the simple feature system proposed here can handle such complex linguistic phenomena, but additional mechanisms might be required to treat other linguistic constructions. The standard account of adverbial modification in standard LCG, for instance, treats adverbs as functors.
