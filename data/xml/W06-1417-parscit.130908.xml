This paper presents the design of a discourse

documents containing arguments, and an

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980288135593">
The goal of our research is to develop methods by
which intelligent systems can help lay audiences to
understand biomedical and other kinds of scientific
arguments. We have been studying how one type
of lay-communication and biomedical-domain ex-
pert, the genetic counselor, presents written argu-
ments in patient letters, standard documents
summarizing information and services provided to
the client (Baker et al., 2002). Clinical genetics
involves causal probabilistic reasoning, e.g., diag-
nosis of a genetic basis for a health problem or
prediction of inheritance risks. The patient letter is
designed to document the experts’ reasoning for
medical and legal purposes, as well as to provide
an explanation that a lay client can understand.
This paper presents, for the first time, the design
of a discourse generator that plans the content and
organization of genetic counseling patient letters
containing arguments; and an experiment that we
performed to evaluate the arguments. The dis-
course generation process involves three modules:
a qualitative causal probabilistic domain model, a
normative argument generator, and a genre-
specific discourse grammar. In (Green, 2005), we
reported a corpus study that produced a reliable
biomedical coding scheme. In subsequent work-
shop papers (Green et al., 2004; 2005), we intro-
duced our use of qualitative probabilistic
constraints and provided a brief description of the
biomedical domain model. We have also provided
informal descriptions of argument patterns in the
corpus (Green, to appear; 2006). However, we
have not previously published the design of the
discourse generator, including the discourse
grammar and argument generator, and their rela-
tionship to the domain model.
The theoretical significance of this work is
three-fold. First, it is empirically based, i.e., based
on analysis of arguments in a corpus of genetic
counseling patient letters, since the goal is to pro-
duce the same kinds of normative arguments as are
used in expert-lay communication. Second, the
normative argument generator creates an inten-
tional-level representation of the arguments in the
text, which provides a foundation for an intelligent
system’s ability to engage in follow-up discussion
about the arguments that have been presented. Fi-
nally, due to the separation of domain, argument,
and genre-specific concerns in the design, and due
to the methodology used to acquire a domain
model, it should be possible to apply this approach
to lay-oriented argument generation in other do-
mains. The practical significance of this work is
that it is major step in the design of a deployable
system to generate the first draft of genetic coun-
seling patient letters. As genetics plays an increas-
ingly important role in medicine, there is a need for
tools to aid in dissemination of patient-tailored in-
formation.

2 System Overview
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996423076923">
We are developing a prototype system for genetic
counselors that will synthesize the first draft of a
patient letter. The deployed system will consist of
a graphical user interface for the genetic counselor,
a domain model/reasoner, an argument generator, a
discourse grammar, and a linguistic realizer. Proto-
types of all components except the linguistic real-
izer have been implemented. Although this paper
focuses on discourse generation and its relationship
to the domain model, as background we now de-
scribe the flow of information through the system.
The domain model (section 3) is initialized with
generic information on clinical genetics. Through a
user interface providing menus and other non-free-
text input devices, the counselor will provide stan-
dard clinical information such as a patient’s symp-
toms and information about his family tree; test
results; preliminary diagnosis (before testing); and
final diagnosis (after test results are known). The
system uses this information to transform its ge-
neric domain model into a specialized domain
model of the patient and his family.
In this genre, a patient letter must provide not
only the above information, but arguments for the
diagnosis and other inferences made by the medi-
cal experts. The discourse generation process
works as follows. A discourse grammar (section 4)
encodes the high-level topic structure of letters in
this genre. The discourse grammar rules generate a
derivation instantiated from the domain model with
information specific to a patient’s case. For each of
the writer’s claims about the case for which a nor-
mative argument must be provided according to
standard practice, the discourse grammar invokes
the argument generator.
The argument generator (section 5) uses non-
domain-specific argument strategies that are in-
stantiated with information from the domain
model. The argument generator returns a structured
representation of an argument in which the com-
municative function of information, e.g., as data or
warrant, is identified. As illustrated in section 6, in
future interactive systems knowledge of commu-
nicative function could be used to support follow-
up discussion. In the current prototype, this knowl-
edge is used to determine presentation order, e.g.,
that data supporting a claim is to be presented be-
fore that claim. One of the goals of the experiment
described in section 7 was to evaluate this order-
ing. In the final system, the output of discourse
generation will be transformed by a linguistic real-
izer into the first draft of a letter.

3 Domain Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999920378378378">
In a previous study of the corpus (Green, 2005),
we identified a small set of categories (e.g. geno-
type, test result, symptom) with good inter-rater
reliability that can be used to describe the biomedi-
cal content of a genetic counseling letter as a
causal probabilistic network (Korb and Nicholson,
2004). A prototype domain model has been manu-
ally constructed covering representative genetic
disorders using only these categories of variables.
By restricting a domain model to these categories,
the result should reflect the simplified conceptual
model of genetics used by genetic counselors in
communication with their lay clients; this facili-
tates generation since the generator will not have to
distinguish what information in the domain model
is appropriate to communicate to a lay audience.
Another benefit of restricting a domain model in
this way is that it reduces the knowledge acquisi-
tion effort of choosing variables and determining
network topology; any genetic disorder in the
scope of the coding scheme (over 4500 single-gene
autosomal disorders) would be modeled in terms of
a small number of variable types and a standard
topology. Thus, it should be straightforward to
semi-automatically construct a domain model cov-
ering many different genetic disorders.
Figure 1 shows part of a domain model after it
has been updated with information about a particu-
lar patient’s case. The nodes labeled GJB2
(mother), GJB2 (father), GJB2 (child) are geno-
type variables, representing the mother’s, father’s,
and child’s GBJ2 genotype, respectively. (A geno-
type is a pair of alleles of a gene; one allele is in-
herited from each parent. An individual who has
two mutated alleles of the GJB2 gene usually ex-
periences hearing loss.) The nodes labeled hearing
loss (child) and non-syndromic (child) are vari-

ables representing the child’s symptoms. The node
labeled test result (child) is a variable representing
the results of testing the child’s GJB2 genotype.
The most likely states of the variables are
shown beside the nodes in Figure 1; T1 and T2 rep-
resent the time at which the (experts’) belief is
held, before or after the child’s genetic test results
are known, respectively. The information recorded
in the network about this particular case is that the
child was observed to have hearing loss and no
features of a genetic syndrome; the preliminary
diagnosis, i.e. before testing, was that the cause of
hearing loss is having two mutated alleles of GJB2;
the test results were negative, however; thus, the
current diagnosis is some other (unspecified) auto-
somal recessively inherited genetic condition, rep-
resented by the genotype variable labeled other
genotype (child). In addition, the parents are hy-
pothesized to be carriers (i.e. to each have one mu-
tated allele) of that genotype, represented by the
variables labeled other genotype (mother), other
genotype (father).
Although a causal probabilistic network used to
perform diagnosis or risk calculation would require
specification of numeric probabilities, the role of
the network in our system is to qualitatively model
the reasoning that the medical experts have per-
formed outside of the system. Also, we found that
in the corpus numeric probabilities were provided
only when citing epidemiological statistics or risks
calculated according to Mendelian inheritance the-
ory (which does not require Bayesian probability
computation). Thus, instead of using numeric
probabilities for domain reasoning, the domain
model uses qualitative constraints based upon for-
mal relations of qualitative influence, product syn-
ergy, and additive synergy (Druzdzel and Henrion,
1993).
In addition to being adequate for natural lan-
guage generation, this approach greatly reduces
knowledge acquisition effort; it should be straight-
forward to semi-automatically acquire the qualita-
tive constraints of a full-scale domain model due to
regularities in this domain and the use of a re-
stricted set of variable types as described above.
For example, qualitative constraints between geno-
types of parents and child would be determined by
whether a genotype follows an autosomal domi-
nant or recessive inheritance pattern.
We now describe some of the qualitative do-
main constraints. An influence relation holds be-
tween a node in a causal graph and its direct
descendant. A has a positive qualitative influence
on B, written S+(state(A,VA), state(B,VB)), if the
state of A reaching a threshold value VA makes it
more likely that the state of B reaches value VB.
For example, if having two mutated alleles of a
genotype A normally results in the appearance of a
symptom B, this could be described as
S+(state(A,2), state(B,yes)). Each arc in Figure 1
implicitly represents an S+ relation.
Product and additive synergy describe converg-
ing connections, i.e., the relation between a set of
variables {A, B} and their direct descendant C in a
graph. A and B have negative product synergy
with respect to state VC of C, written
X-({state(A,VA), state(B,VB)}, state(C,VC)), if
either the state of A reaching a threshold VA or the
state of B reaching a threshold VB makes it more
likely that the state of C reaches VC. This type of
relationship characterizes mutually exclusive alter-
native diagnoses that could account for the same
symptom; it also characterizes autosomal dominant
inheritance, an inheritance pattern where inheriting
one mutated allele of a genotype (from either par-
ent) is usually sufficient to cause health problems.
In Figure 1, the possible alternative causes of the
symptoms are indicated by the X- annotations.
On the other hand, autosomal recessive inheri-
tance, an inheritance pattern where inheriting two
mutated alleles (one from each parent) is usually
necessary to cause health problems, is character-
ized by zero product synergy (X0); A and B have
zero product synergy with respect to state VC of C,
X0({state(A,VA), state(B,VB)}, state(C,VC)), if the
state of A reaching a threshold VA and the state of
B reaching a threshold VB makes it more likely that
the state of C reaches VC. For example, if the
mother’s, father’s, and child’s genotype are repre-
sented by variables A, B, and C, respectively, then
X0({state(A,1), state(B,1)}, state(C,2)) can repre-
sent the constraint that if the child’s genotype C
has two mutated alleles, then one mutated allele
must have come from each parent. In Figure 1, the
autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of GJB2
and the other hypothesized genetic disorder are
indicated by the X0 annotations.
Other qualitative constraints used in the domain
model are based on negative qualitative influence
(S-), positive product synergy (X+), and negative
additive synergy (Y-). In addition, the domain
model stores epidemiological statistics as probabil-

ity statements composed of variables used in the
network, e.g., the frequency of hearing loss due to
GJB2. This type of information can be used as
backing in an argument (see section 5) but does not
play a role in domain reasoning.

4 Discourse Grammar
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983631578948">
A discourse grammar was written based upon our
analysis of the corpus and a description of standard
practice in genetic counseling (Baker et al., 2002).
The current grammar is intended to cover letters on
single-factor autosomal genetic disorders. Thanks
to the regularities in this domain and in this genre,
the grammar consists of a small number of rules.
The starting rule of the grammar represents the
main sections of a letter in their standard order:
opening, referral, preliminary diagnosis, testing,
final diagnosis, origin of genetic condition, inheri-
tance implications, prognosis/treatment, and clos-
ing. One or more grammar rules describe each of
these sections.
Grammar rules may request the domain rea-
soner for case-specific information to be included
in the letter. In addition, when the grammar pro-
vides a choice of rules, rule selection is based upon
case-specific information provided by the domain
reasoner. For example, one rule for reporting the
final diagnosis handles cases in which the patient’s
test results confirm the preliminary diagnosis, and
another rule those cases where the preliminary di-
agnosis has been disconfirmed by test results; the
domain reasoner returns the information needed to
choose between those two rules.
The process described so far creates an initial
outline of the information to be presented (in non-
linguistic form), including various claims requiring
an argument. Each of those claims is passed to the
argument generator described in the next section.
For example, the letter shown in Figure 2 contains
seven claims labeled C1 to C7; argument generation
adds information labeled D1 to D7, W1 to W7, and
B1 to B4. The information returned by the argument
generator is added to the outline, completing the
structure that will be transformed by the linguistic
realizer into text.

5 Argument Generation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984983566037736">
Given a claim, the argument generator uses argu-
ment strategies to construct a normative argument
for the claim from information provided by the
domain reasoner. The strategies are non-domain-
specific in the sense that they refer to formal prop-
erties of the qualitative causal probabilistic domain
model rather than to genetics.
According to Toulmin’s model of normative
argument structure (1998), an argument for a claim
can be analyzed in terms of various functional
components: the data, warrant, and backing. The
data are the facts used to defend a claim. The war-
rant is a principle that licenses the claim given the
data. An optional backing may be used to justify
the warrant, e.g., by giving the facts upon which
the warrant is based. To derive the argument
strategies used in the system, we analyzed the ar-
guments in the corpus in terms of Toulmin’s
model; the resulting strategies describe mappings
from formal properties of the domain model to the
data and warrant supporting a claim and to the
backing of a warrant. Several strategies are para-
phrased below for illustration.
Strategy 1. Argument for belief in causal claim,
based on effects: An argument for the claim that it
is believed to some extent at time Ti that
state(A,VA) holds and that state(A,VA) is responsi-
ble for the states of variables B1..Bi, i.e.,
state(B1,VB1) .. state(Bi,VBi), consists of the (pre-
supposed) data that state(B1,VB1) .. state(Bi,VBi)
hold, and optionally other data that state(Bj,VBj) ..
state(Bk,VBk) hold, where the warrant is a positive
influence relation S+(state(A,VA), state(Bp,VBp))
for each Bp in { B1 .. Bi , Bj .. Bk}.
Strategy 2. Argument for decrease in belief to
unlikely that state of causal variable is at or over
threshold value, based on absence of predicted
effect: An argument for the claim that there has
been a decrease in belief, from time T1 to T2, to the
belief at T2 that it is unlikely that state(A,VA)
holds, consists of the (newly acquired) data that it
is unlikely that state(C,VCi) holds for all VCi$VC,
where the warrant is a positive influence relation
S+(state(A,VA), state(C,VC)).
Strategy 3. Argument for increase in belief in
causal claim, based on decrease in belief in alter-
native cause: An argument for the claim that there
has been a increase in belief, from time T1 to T2, to
the belief at T2 that it is believed to some extent
that state(A,VA) holds and that state(A,VA) is re-
sponsible for the states of variables state(B1,VB1) ..
state(Bi,VBi), consists of the (presupposed) data
that state(B1,VB1) .. state(Bi,VBi) hold, and the

(newly acquired) data that it is unlikely that
state(Alt,VAlt) holds for all VAlt&gt;_Vthreshold, where the
warrant is a negative product synergy relation
X-({state(A,VA),state(Alt,Vthreshold)},state(B,VB))
for each B in {B1 .. Bi}.
Strategy 4. Argument for belief in joint respon-
sibility, based on effect. An argument for the claim
that it is believed to some extent at time Ti that
state(A,VA) and state(B,VB) hold and that
state(A,VA) and state(B,VB) are jointly responsible
for state(C,VC), consists of the (presupposed) data
that state(C,VC) holds, where the warrant is a zero
product synergy relation X°({state(A,VA),

6 Example

<bodyText confidence="0.999990594936709">
This section gives an example of discourse genera-
tion for the case in section 3. An outline created by
application of the discourse grammar to the do-
main model in Figure 1 would contain, in addition
to basic information about the case not requiring an
argument, several claims requiring further support
to be provided by the argument generator.
First, the claim that it was believed, before test-
ing, that the child’s hearing loss could be due to
having two mutated alleles of GJB2 would be sup-
ported by an argument constructed using Strategy
1. The data of the argument is the presupposition
that the child has hearing loss and the additional
finding that she has no syndromic features. The
warrant is the positive influence relations (S+) link-
ing the variable representing the child’s GJB2
genotype to each of the two variables representing
the child’s symptoms. Note that if a reader ques-
tioned this argument, an interactive system could
provide information on the source of the data or
epidemiological statistics backing the warrant.
Second, the claim that it is currently believed,
after testing, that it is unlikely that the child’s
GJB2 genotype has two mutated alleles would be
supported by an argument constructed using Strat-
egy 2. The data of the argument is that the child’s
GJB2 test results were negative. The warrant is the
positive influence relation (S+) from the child’s
GJB2 genotype to the child’s GJB2 test results,
which predicts that if the child had this mutation,
then the test results would have been positive. If a
reader questioned this argument, an interactive sys-
tem could provide information on the source of the
data or back the warrant by providing information
about the rate of false negatives.
Third, the claim that it is currently believed,
after testing, that it is possible that the child has
some other genetic condition that is responsible for
her hearing loss would be supported by an argu-
ment constructed using Strategy 3. The data of the
argument is that she has hearing loss and the cur-
rent belief that GJB2 is not likely responsible. The
warrant is the negative product synergy relation
(X-) between the child’s GJB2 genotype and an-
other genotype to hearing loss. If a reader ques-
tioned this argument, an interactive system could
provide information on the proportion of cases of
hearing loss that are due to other genetic conditions
as backing for the warrant.
Fourth, the claim that it is currently believed,
after testing, that it is possible that the parents are
carriers (i.e., each has one mutated allele) of the
unspecified genotype claimed to be responsible for
the child’s hearing loss would be supported by an
argument constructed using Strategy 4. The data of
the argument is the presupposition that the child
has two mutated alleles of the other genotype. The
warrant is the zero product synergy relation (X°)
between the two parents’ genotype for this alterna-
tive to GJB2 and the child’s genotype for this same
alternative. If a reader questioned this argument, an
interactive system could provide an explanation of
the warrant, which is based on the theory of Men-
delian inheritance; or it could provide the argument
for the data, i.e., the belief that the child has two
mutated alleles of the other genotype.
Finally, the claim that it is currently believed,
after testing, that assuming they are both carriers
there is a 25% probability that each future child
that the two parents have together will inherit two
mutated alleles of the other genotype would be
supported by an argument constructed by a strat-
egy not shown in section 5. The data is the as-
sumption that the parents are both carriers, and the
warrant is the same zero product synergy relation
(X°) used in the argument for the fourth claim. If a
reader questioned this argument, an interactive sys-
tem could provide an explanation of how the prob-
abilities are determined by zero product synergy.

Argument generation was evaluated in the follow-

<bodyText confidence="0.999990234375">
screened beforehand for writing ability in biology,
were shown two patient letters. The letters were
created by the experimenter by paraphrasing the
output of discourse generation that would be input
to the realizer. The paraphrases are similar in syn-
tax and lexical style to letters in the corpus, but the
genetic disorders covered in the experiment’s let-
ters differ from those covered in the corpus. One
letter concerns a child confirmed to have cystic
fibrosis (CF); the other a child whose test results
for Waardenburg syndrome (WS) were negative.
The text of letter CF is given in Figure 2. The first
column contains annotations describing the com-
municative function of the information: C for
claim, D for data, W for warrant, and B for back-
ing. Each label is subscripted with an integer refer-
ring to the argument. (The row labeled C2/D3
functions as both the claim of argument 2 and the
data of argument 3.) Annotations were not shown
to the experiment’s participants. Communicative
function was used to determine presentation order
within each argument. Letters CF and WS had 23
and 25 segments, respectively, where a segment is
defined as a unit fulfilling one of the above func-
tions, or a non-argument-related function.
The goal of the experiment was to conduct a
preliminary evaluation of the acceptability of the
arguments in terms of content, explicitness, and
presentation order within arguments. The partici-
pants were asked to revise each letter as needed to
make it more appropriate for its intended recipi-
ents, the biological parents of a patient. Partici-
pants were told they could reword, reorder, and
make deletions and additions to a letter. The results
are summarized in Table 1, which includes the av-
erage number of segments to/from which informa-
tion was added (New) or deleted (Delete), and
reordered (Reorder). (Rewordings are not tabulated
since it was not our goal to evaluate wording.)
New and Delete are measures of acceptability of
argument content and explicitness. Reorder is a
measure of acceptability of ordering. On average,
the number of New, Delete, and Reorder revisions
were low: less than two per letter, with most revi-
sions in the category of Reorder. This is encourag-
ing since the system to be built for genetic
counselors should provide acceptable arguments
requiring a minimum of revision.
To provide more details about the results, first,
the only segments to which participants added in-
formation are warrants. The deletions of data con-
sist of information presumably already known to
the recipients, e.g. D6 in letter CF; other deletions
are of part or all of a warrant or all of a backing.
The only deletions of claims consist of information
duplicated in another part of the letter; there were
no cases where a claim was deleted even though it
could be inferred from data and warrant. The reor-
derings were across-argument, which violates con-
ventional topic structure in the genre, or within-
argument. In the latter, half repositioned a claim
from final position in an argument to a position
before the warrant or backing; the other half repo-
sitioned the warrant or backing before the data.

Due to space limitations, this section focuses on
research on generation of normative arguments (as
opposed to behavior-change and evaluative argu-
ments), and arguments designed for text rather than
dialogue. Zukerman et al. have presented several
papers on argument generation from Bayesian
network domain models (e.g., 2000). The type of
domain model used in our work differs in two re-
spects. First, it is based on empirical research since
it is intended to represent the simplified conceptual
model presented to a lay audience in this genre.
Second, it uses qualitative probabilistic constraints.
One difference in argument generation is that our
system’s argument strategies are based on analysis
of the corpus. Also, our system creates an inten-
tional-level representation of an argument.
Teufel and Moens (2002) present a coding
scheme for scientific argumentation in research
articles that is designed for automatic summariza-
tion of human-authored text. Thus, it would not be
sufficient for generation from a non-linguistic
knowledge base. Also, it does not make the finer-
grained distinctions of the Toulmin model.
Branting et al. (1999) present the architecture of
a legal document drafting system. In it, a discourse
grammar applies genre-specific knowledge, while
a legal reasoning module creates the illocutionary
structure of legal arguments. Branting et al. argue
for maintaining a distinct intentional-level repre-
sentation of arguments to support interactive fol-
low-up discussion. We agree, but our design
further distinguishes domain reasoning from argu-
ment generation.
As for work on ordering and explicitness, Reed

genetic counseling letters containing arguments. A

ising. The most important contribution of this work
is the design of a non-domain-specific normative
argument generator that creates an intentional-level
representation of an argument. From the corpus,
we formulated argument strategies that map formal
properties of qualitative causal probabilistic mod-
els to components of Toulmin’s model. Due to the
separation of domain, argument and genre-specific
concerns and the methodology used for acquiring
the domain model, this approach should be appli-
cable to lay-oriented normative argument genera-
tion in other domains.

[Patient] was referred by [doctor] to [clinic] on [date] for evaluation.
D1 She has had frequent respiratory infections.
W1 A genetic condition known as cystic fibrosis (CF) can cause respiratory problems.
B1 Eighty percent of CF patients have chronic respiratory complaints.
C1 [Doctor] suspected that CF could be the cause of her respiratory problems.
Patient was given a sweat chloride test for CF.
D2 The test showed an abnormal sweat chloride level (75 mmol/L).
W2 A result over 60 mmol/L is considered positive for CF.
C2 / It is very likely that [patient] has CF. This means that cells in [patient’s] body contain two altered copies
D3 of a gene called CFTR.
W3 This alteration affects organs that secrete mucous, such as the lungs. The alteration causes excessive se-
cretions, resulting in frequent lung infections.
C3 This alteration of the CFTR gene is most likely the cause of [patient’s] respiratory problems.
D4 Both of you, [patient’s] parents, are of Northern European ancestry.
B4 One in twenty-five people of N. European ancestry carry one altered copy of the CFTR gene.
C4 Each of you could carry this alteration.
W5 Our cells contain two copies of each gene. One copy is inherited from each parent. A child who inherited
two altered copies of a gene must have gotten one ... from the mother and one ... from the father.
D5 Since [patient’s] cells contain two altered copies of CFTR,
C5 it is likely that she got one altered copy of CFTR from each of you.
C6 This is likely
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.8105679">
D6 even though neither of you have cystic fibrosis.
W6 When a parent has one altered copy and one normal copy of a gene such as CFTR, he or she is not usually
affected. Someone who has only one altered copy is called a “carrier”. A child who inherits two altered
copies will be affected since she has no normal copy.
W7 A couple in which both are carriers will have a one in four (25%) chance that each child that they con-
ceive will inherit two altered copies and be affected. This also means that they have a three in four (75%)
chance that the child will inherit at least one unaltered copy from one parent and not be affected.
D7 Assuming that you are both carriers,
C7 the chances for each child that you conceive together is 25% that the child will have CF, and 75% that the
child will not have CF.

The patient letter is designed to document the experts’ reasoning for medical and legal purposes, as well as to provide an explanation that a lay client can understand. This paper presents, for the first time, the design of a discourse generator that plans the content and organization of genetic counseling patient letters containing arguments; and an experiment that we performed to evaluate the arguments. The discourse generation process involves three modules: a qualitative causal probabilistic domain model, a normative argument generator, and a genrespecific discourse grammar. In (Green, 2005), we reported a corpus study that produced a reliable biomedical coding scheme. In subsequent workshop papers (Green et al., 2004; 2005), we introduced our use of qualitative probabilistic constraints and provided a brief description of the biomedical domain model. We have also provided informal descriptions of argument patterns in the corpus (Green, to appear; 2006).

As illustrated in section 6, in future interactive systems knowledge of communicative function could be used to support followup discussion. In the current prototype, this knowledge is used to determine presentation order, e.g., that data supporting a claim is to be presented before that claim. One of the goals of the experiment described in section 7 was to evaluate this ordering. In the final system, the output of discourse generation will be transformed by a linguistic realizer into the first draft of a letter. 3 Domain Model In a previous study of the corpus (Green, 2005), we identified a small set of categories (e.g. genotype, test result, symptom) with good inter-rater reliability that can be used to describe the biomedical content of a genetic counseling letter as a causal probabilistic network (Korb and Nicholson, 2004). A prototype domain model has been manually constructed covering representative genetic disorders using only these categories of variables. By restricting a domain model to these categories, the result should reflect the simplified conceptual model of genetics used by genetic counselors in communication with their lay clients; this facilita</context>

Zukerman et al. have presented several papers on argument generation from Bayesian network domain models (e.g., 2000). The type of domain model used in our work differs in two respects. First, it is based on empirical research since it is intended to represent the simplified conceptual model presented to a lay audience in this genre. Second, it uses qualitative probabilistic constraints. One difference in argument generation is that our system’s argument strategies are based on analysis of the corpus. Also, our system creates an intentional-level representation of an argument. Teufel and Moens (2002) present a coding scheme for scientific argumentation in research articles that is designed for automatic summarization of human-authored text. Thus, it would not be sufficient for generation from a non-linguistic knowledge base. Also, it does not make the finergrained distinctions of the Toulmin model. Branting et al.
