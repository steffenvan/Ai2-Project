This paper describes an approach to identify-
ing the syntactic role of an antecedent in a Ko-
rean relative clause, which is essential to struc-
tural disambiguation and semantic analysis. In
a learning phase, linguistic knowledge such as
conceptual co-occurrence patterns and syntac-
tic role distribution of antecedents is extracted
from a large-scale corpus. Then, in an appli-
cation phase, the extracted knowledge is ap-
plied in determining the correct syntactic role
of an antecedent in relative clauses. Unlike pre-
vious research based on co-occurrence patterns
at the lexical level, we represent co-occurrence
patterns with concept types in a thesaurus. In
an experiment, the proposed method showed a
high accuracy rate of 90.4% in resolving am-
biguities of syntactic role determination of an-
tecedents.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943472222222">
A relative clause is the one that modifies an an-
tecedent in a sentence. To determine the syn-
tactic role of the antecedent in a verb argu-
ment structure of relative clause is important in
parsing and structural disambiguation(Li et al.,
1998). While applying case frames of a verb for
structural disambiguation, identifying the role
of antecedent will affect the correctness of struc-
tural disambiguation impressively.
In this paper, we will describe a method of
identifying the syntactic role of antecedents,
which consists of two phases. First, in the
learning phase, conceptual patterns (CPs) and
syntactic role distribution of antecedents are
extracted from a corpus of 6 million words,
the Korean Language Information Base (KLIB).
The conceptual patterns reflect the possible case
restriction of a verb with concept types, while
the syntactic role distribution shows the prefer-
ence of syntactic role of antecedents of a verb.
Second, in the application phase, the syntactic
role of an antecedent is decided using CPs and
the syntactic role distribution.
In regards to the rest of this paper, Section
2 will review the problems and related work.
Section 3 will describe a statistical approach
of conceptual pattern extraction from a large
corpus as knowledge for determining syntactic
roles. Section 4 will describe how to identify
syntactic roles using conceptual patterns and
syntactic role distribution of antecedents in the
corpus. Section 5 will then present an experi-
mental evaluation of the method. The last sec-
tion makes a conclusion with some discussion.
The Yale Romanization is used to represent Ko-
rean expressions.

2 Problems and Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999849857142857">
In English, it is possible to recognize the syntac-
tic role of antecedents by their position (trace)
in relative clauses and the valency information
of verbs. For example, the syntactic role of an
antecedent man can be recognized as subject of
the relative clause in a sentence &amp;quot;He is the man
who lives next door&amp;quot; and as object in a sen-
tence &amp;quot;He is the man whom I met.&amp;quot; The rela-
tive pronouns such as who, whom, that, whose,
and which can also be used in identifying the
role of antecedents in relative clauses.
However, it is not a trivial work to identify
the syntactic role of antecedents in Korean rel-
ative clauses. Korean is such a head final lan-
guage that the antecedent comes after the rel-
ative clause. The rest of this section will de-
scribe three main characteristics of Korean rel-
ative clauses that make it difficult to determine
the syntactic role of their antecedents. The first
characteristic is that unlike English, Korean
lacks relative words corresponding to English

relative pronouns. Instead, an adnominal verb
ending follows its verb stem of a relative clause
modifying an antecedent. The adnominal verb
ending does not provide any information about
the syntactic role of antecedent. For example,
the relative clause kang-eyse hulu- (flow in a
river) in sentence (1) modifies the antecedent
mtvu/- (water), while adnominal verb ending -
nun provides no clue about the syntactic role of
the antecedent mw.u/ (water). Figure 1 shows
the syntactic dependency tree (SDT) of sen-
tence (1). We need to decide the syntactic role
of the antecedent mwu/- (water) in the argu-
ment structure of the verb hulu- (flow) when
applying case frames of the verb for structural
disambiguation. The dependency parser (Lee,
1995) only gives the syntactic relation mod be-
tween them, which should be regarded as subject
in the relative clause.

ta.
(I saw water that flowed in a river.)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896666666667">
As the second characteristic, the syntac-
tic role of an antecedent cannot be determined
by word order. This is because Korean is a rel-
atively free word-order language like Japanese,
Russian, or Finnish, and also because some ar-
guments of a verb may be frequently omitted.
In sentence (2), for example, the verb of rela-
tive clause nolay-lul pwulless-ten (where [I] sang
a song [at the place]) have two arguments [I]
and [place] omitted. Thus, the antecedent kos-
(place) might be identified as subject or adver-
bial in the relative clause.

ta.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998899516129032">
(I went to the place where [I] sang a song
[at the place].)
The third characteristic of Korean relative
clauses is that the case particle of an antecedent,
that indicates the syntactic role in the relative
clause, is omitted during relativization. In fact,
in a relatively free-word order language, the case
particles are very important to the syntactic role
determination.
Due to lack of syntactic clues, it is very dif-
ficult to construct general rules for identify-
ing the syntactic role of antecendents. Thus,
the corpus-based method has been prefered
to the rule-based one in solving the prob-
lem of syntactic role determination in Korean
relative clauses. Yang and Kim (1993) pro-
posed a corpus-based method, where, for each
noun/verb pair, its word co-occurrence and sub-
categorization scores are extracted at lexical
level. Park and Kim (1997) described a method
of semantic role determination of antecedents
using verbal patterns and statistic information
from a corpus. These word co-occurrence pat-
terns are all at lexical-level, so we have to con-
struct a large amount of word co-occurrence
patterns and statistical information before ap-
plying to a real large-scale problem. Actually,
the system performance mainly relies on the do-
main of application, the number of word co-
occurrence patterns extracted, and the size of
corpus.

In the following sections, we will describe
an approach to acquiring statistical information
at conceptual level rather than at lexical level
from a corpus using conceptual hierarchy in the
Kadokawa thesaurus titled New Synonym Dic-
tionary (Ohno and Hamanishi, 1981), and also
describe a method of syntactic role determina-
tion using the extracted knowledge. The system
architecture is shown in Figure 2.

3 Extraction of Statistic Information
from Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879766666667">
First, for each of 100 verbs selected by order of
frequency in the KLIB (Korean Language In-
formation Base) corpus of 6 million words, its
syntactic relational patterns (SRPs) of the form
(Noun, Syntactic relation, Verb) are extracted
from the corpus. Then, the nominal words in
the SRPs are substituted with their correspond-
ing concept codes at level 4 of the Kadokawa
thesaurus. A nominal word may have multi-
ple meanings such as C1, C2, ..., C. However,
since we cannot determine which meaning of
the nominal word is used in a SRP, we uni-
formly add to the frequency of each concept
code. Through this processing, the syntactic
relational pattern (SRP) changes into the con-
ceptual frequency pattern (CFP), ({ &lt; C1, Ii &gt;
, &lt; C2,12 &gt;, •••,&lt; Cm, fm &gt;}, SR3, Vk), where
C, represents a concept code at level four of the
Kadokawa thesaurus, ft indicates the frequency
of the code C, and SR3 shows a syntactic rela-
tion between these concept codes and verb Vk.
These patterns are then generalized by a con-
cept type filter into more abstract conceptual
patterns (CPs), MCI, C2, ..., SR3, Vk)11 &lt;
j &lt; 5, 1 &lt; k &lt; 1001. Unlike in CFPs, the con-
cept code in the more generalized CPs may be
not only at level four (denoted as L4), but also
at level three (L3) and two (L2). In addition
to the CPs, we also extract the syntactic role
distributiion of antecedents.

3.1 Retrieving Syntactic Relational
Patterns from Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999587818181818">
Unlike the conventional parsing problem whose
main goal is to completely analyze a whole sen-
tence, the extraction of syntactic relational pat-
terns (SRPs) aims to partially analyze sentences
and thus to get the syntactic relations between
nominals and verbs. For this, we designed a
partial parser, the analysis result of which is
obviously not as precise as that of a full-parser.
However, it can provide much useful informa-
tion. For the set of 100 verbs, a total of 282,216
syntactic relational patterns (SRPs) was ex-
tracted from the KLIB corpus. During the gen-
eralization step, the problematic patterns are
filtered out.
In Korean, the syntactic relation of nominal
words toward a verb is mainly determined by
case particles. During the extraction of SRPs
(Ni, SR3, Vk), we only consider the syntactic
relation SR3s determined by 5 types of case
particles: nominative (-i/ka/kkeyse), accusative
(-u///u/), and three adverbial (-ey/eynun, -
se/eyse/eysenun, -lo/ulo/ulonun).

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949173913044">
For the purpose of type generalization of nom-
inal words in SRPs, the Kadokawa thesaurus
titled New Synonym Dictionary (Ohno and
Hamanishi, 1981) is used, which has a four-level
hierarchy with about 1,000 semantic classes.
Each class of upper three levels is further di-
vided into 10 subclasses, and is encoded with a
unique number. For example, the class &apos;station-
ary&apos; at level three is encoded with the number
96 and classified into ten subclasses, Figure 3
shows the structure of the Kadokawa thesaurus.
To assign the concept code of Kadokawa
thesaurus to Korean words, we take advan-
tage of the existing Japanese-Korean bilingual
dictionary (JKBD) that was developed for a
Japanese-Korean MT system called COBALT-
J/K. The bilingual dictionary contains more
than 120,000 words, the meaning of which is en-
coded with the concept codes that are at level
four in the Kadokawa thesaurus. Thus, Korean
words in the SRPs are automatically assigned
their corresponding concept codes of level four
through JKBD.

We encoded the nouns in SRPs extracted by the
parser with concept codes from the Kadokawa
thesaurus, and examined histograms of the fre-

frequency of codes for different syntactic rela-
tions of a verb showed very different distribution
shapes. This means that we could use the dis-

frequencies as clues for conceptual pattern ex-

traction. From the histograms of codes of both
subject and object relational patterns for the
verb ttena-ta (leave), we observed that concept
codes about human (codes from 500 to 599) ap-
pear most frequently in the role of subject, and
codes of position (from 100 to 109), codes of
place (from 700 to 709) and codes of building
(from 940 to 949) appear most often in the role
of object.
For each verb Vk, we first analyzed the co-
occurrence frequencies f, of concept codes Ci
of noun N, and then computed an average fre-
quency fave,t and standard deviation at around

quency f

cies. If at is small, then the shape of the his-
togram will tend to be flat, which means that
each concept code can be used equally as an ar-
gument of a verb with syntactic role SR,. If
at is large, it means that there is one or more
codes that tend to be peaks in the histogram,
and the corresponding nouns for these concept
codes are likely to be used as arguments of a
verb. The filter in our system selects the pat-
terns that have a variation larger than threshold
ao,t, and pulls out the concept codes that have a
strength of frequency larger than threshold ko,t.
If the value of the variation is small, than we
can assume there is no peak frequency for the
nouns. The patterns that are produced by the
filter should represent the concept types of ex-
tracted words that appear most frequently as
syntactic role SR, with verb Vk.
We later analyzed the distribution of fre-
quency f, in CFP.is to produce an aver-
age frequency avef,t and standard deviation
J
at. Through experimentation, we decided
the threshold of standard deviation a-0,t and
strength of frequency ko,t as shown in Table 1.
The lower the value of threshold ko,t is assigned,
the more concept codes can be extracted as
conceptual patterns from the CFPs. We main-
tained a balance between extracting conceptual
codes at low levels of the conceptual hierar-
chy for the specific usage of concept type and
extracting general concept types for enhancing
overall system performance. These values may
be variable in different application.
In Table 2, we enlist the concept types that
have more than 5 appearances in the CFP of
verb ttena-ta (leave). The strength of frequen-
cies for generalization is calculated with formula

Since the value of k0,4 is set at 4.0, as shown
in Table 1, the concept codes with frequencies
of more than 13, as the equation for k14,4 shows,
are selected as generalized concept types at L4.
After abstraction at L4, the system performs
generalization at L3. It removes selected fre-
quencies, such as frequency 14 of code 411 in
Table 2, and sums up the frequencies of the re-
maining concept codes to form the frequency
of higher level group. For example, the system
removes the frequency for code 411 from the
group {410(12), 411(14), 412(3), 413(0), 414(0),
415(0), 416(1), 417(0), 418(0), 419(0)}, then
sums up the frequencies of the remaining codes
for a more abstract code of 41. The frequency
of code 41 then becomes 16. Through this pro-
cess, the system performs a generalization at L3
for the more abstract types of the concept. The
system calculates at and strength Kf,t, selects
the most promising codes, and stores concep-
tual patterns ({Ci, C2, C3, ...}, S Rj,Vk) as the
knowledge source for syntactic role determina-
tion in real texts, where concept type C, is cre-
ated by the generalization procedure. After gen-
eralization of the CFP patterns for the subject
role of the verb ttena-ta (leave), the produced
conceptual patterns are: (1411, 430, 500, ..., 06,
11, ..., 99, 11, subj, ttena-ta).

3.3 Syntactic Role Distribution of
Antecedents
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985911764706">
In (Yang et al., 1993), they defined subcatego-
rization score (SS) of a verb considering the verb
argument structure in a corpus. They asserted
that the SS of a verb represents how likely a verb
might have a specific grammatical complement.
We observed from analyzing the corpus that
we cannot infer the syntactic roles of an-
tecedents from subcategorization scores since
the syntactic role distribution of verb arguments
in a corpus is so different from the syntactic role
distribution of antecedents due to the property
of free word language. In Korean, an argument
of a verb could be omitted, and so the subcat-
egorization score don&apos;t provide possible trend
of the role of antecedent in many cases. For
example, 26.8% of arguments of the verb ttena-
ta (leave) are used as subjects, and 54.4% are
used as objects, but 74.41% of antecedents of
the verb are of subject role, and 6.9% are of
object role.
Although the distribution of antecedents is
necessary to our task, we cannot automatically
retrieve the syntactic role distribution of them
from the corpus. We extracted relative clauses
for specific verbs from the corpus, and then
counted the number of syntactic roles of the
antecedents manually by language trained peo-
ple. Since there are about 200 to 500 relative
clauses for each verb in the corpus, it is possible
to check this information. This information is
represented by relative score RSk(SRi) of syn-
tactic role SRi for antecedents of verb Vk as is
shown bellow and is used in syntactic role de-
termination as described in section 4:

ing can be one of these empty arguments.
An antecedent (a noun) usually has one
or more meanings, which causes ambigu-
ity in determining the correct syntactic re-
lation between the antecedent and a verb.
We assume that an antecedent has meanings
C1, C2, C3, ..., Cn, and that CP, is a conceptual
pattern ({Pi, P2, ..., Pm},SR,,Vk) correspond-
ing to syntactic relation SR, of verb Vk. The
evaluation score S/Mi(Np, Vk) of an antecedent
Np that can be syntactic role SR, with verb Vk
is defined as formula 4, and conceptual similar-
ity Csim(C„, Pi) between concept C„ and Pi
as formula 5.

5 Experimental Evaluation

An informal way to evaluate the correctness of
syntactic relation determination is to have an
expert examine the test patterns and source
sentences that the patterns appears, and give
his/her judgment about the correctness of the
results produced by the system. In our exper-
iment, the correctness of syntactic and concep-
tual relation determination was evaluated man-
ually by humans who were well trained in de-
pendency syntax.
As a test set, we extracted 1,772 sentences
that included relative clauses for the 100 verbs
from 1.5 million word corpora of integrated Ko-
rean information base and test books of primary
school. The distribution of syntactic relation of
antecedents among them and the test results
were shown in Table 3. There were 1,087 an-
tecedents (61.34%) that were of subject role.
The baseline accuracy of the problem is 61.34%.
That is, if we always select subject role for an-
tecedents, the accuracy will reach 61.34%.

Our system showed 90.4% of accuracy on av-
erage in syntactic relation identification, which
shows that the conceptual patterns and relative
score of syntactic relation produced in the first
phase can be a good source for determining the
syntactic relation of an antecedent.
Through experiment, we observed several fac-
tors that affect the performance of the system.
First, the multiple meanings of a noun will af-
fect the frequency distribution of concept codes.
In our system, we cope with this problem by
adjusting the threshold of standard deviation
and strength value. The second problem is the
sparseness of corpus domain. If the corpus for
learning is specified as a certain domain, it will
greatly increase the validity of conceptual pat-
terns. If we use a sense tagged corpus in the
learning stage, we can achieve high accuracy in
syntactic relation determination.

This paper describes an approach for syntac-
tic role determination between an antecedent
and a verb in relative clause for semantic anal-
ysis. This method consists of two phases. In
the first phase, the system extracts conceptual
patterns and syntactic role distribution of an-
tecedents from a large corpus. In the second
phase, the system applies the extracted con-
ceptual patterns as knowledge in determining
correct syntactic relations for structural disam-
biguation and semantic analysis in MT system
for CG generation.
Unlike previous research that calculates sta-
tistical information at a lexical level for every
pair of words, which may require a lot of space
to store resulting patterns, we represent those
co-occurrence patterns with concept types of
Kadokawa thesaurus. The problematic concept
types are filtered out by the type generaliza-
tion procedure. We used a corpus of 6 mil-
lion words for conceptual pattern extraction.
Our method can cope with the general scope
of texts. In the experiment evaluation, the pro-
posed method showed a high accuracy rate of
90.4% in identifying the syntactic role of an-
tecedents.
The method described in this paper can be
used in resolving syntactic role of antecedents
in relative clauses of other free word order lan-
guages, and can also be used in generating se-
lectional restrictions of case frames of verbs.

Unlike previous research based on co-occurrence patterns at the lexical level, we represent co-occurrence patterns with concept types in a thesaurus. In an experiment, the proposed method showed a high accuracy rate of 90.4% in resolving ambiguities of syntactic role determination of antecedents. 1 Introduction A relative clause is the one that modifies an antecedent in a sentence. To determine the syntactic role of the antecedent in a verb argument structure of relative clause is important in parsing and structural disambiguation(Li et al., 1998). While applying case frames of a verb for structural disambiguation, identifying the role of antecedent will affect the correctness of structural disambiguation impressively. In this paper, we will describe a method of identifying the syntactic role of antecedents, which consists of two phases. First, in the learning phase, conceptual patterns (CPs) and syntactic role distribution of antecedents are extracted from a corpus of 6 million words, the Korean Language Information Base (KLIB). The conceptual patterns reflect the possible case restriction of a verb with concept types, while the synta</context>

Actually, the system performance mainly relies on the domain of application, the number of word cooccurrence patterns extracted, and the size of corpus. 757 In the following sections, we will describe an approach to acquiring statistical information at conceptual level rather than at lexical level from a corpus using conceptual hierarchy in the Kadokawa thesaurus titled New Synonym Dictionary (Ohno and Hamanishi, 1981), and also describe a method of syntactic role determination using the extracted knowledge. The system architecture is shown in Figure 2. 3 Extraction of Statistic Information from Corpus First, for each of 100 verbs selected by order of frequency in the KLIB (Korean Language Information Base) corpus of 6 million words, its syntactic relational patterns (SRPs) of the form (Noun, Syntactic relation, Verb) are extracted from the corpus. Then, the nominal words in the SRPs are substituted with their corresponding concept codes at level 4 of the Kadokawa thesaurus. A nominal word may have multiple</context>

In Korean, the syntactic relation of nominal words toward a verb is mainly determined by case particles. During the extraction of SRPs (Ni, SR3, Vk), we only consider the syntactic relation SR3s determined by 5 types of case particles: nominative (-i/ka/kkeyse), accusative (-u///u/), and three adverbial (-ey/eynun, - se/eyse/eysenun, -lo/ulo/ulonun). 3.2 Conceptual Pattern Extraction 3.2.1 Thesaurus Hierarchy For the purpose of type generalization of nominal words in SRPs, the Kadokawa thesaurus titled New Synonym Dictionary (Ohno and Hamanishi, 1981) is used, which has a four-level hierarchy with about 1,000 semantic classes. Each class of upper three levels is further divided into 10 subclasses, and is encoded with a unique number. For example, the class &apos;stationary&apos; at level three is encoded with the number 96 and classified into ten subclasses, Figure 3 shows the structure of the Kadokawa thesaurus. To assign the concept code of Kadokawa thesaurus to Korean words, we take advantage of the existing Japanese-Korean bilingual dictionary (JKBD) that was developed for a Japanese-Korean MT system called COBALTJ/K.
