Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9849055">
Lexicon is in important resource in any kind of
language processing application. Corpus-based
lexica have several advantages over other tra-
ditional approaches. The lexicon developed for
Sinhala was based on the text obtained from a
corpus of 10 million words drawn from di-
verse genres. The words extracted from the
corpus have been labeled with parts of speech
categories defined according to a novel classi-
fication proposed for Sinhala. The lexicon re-
ports 80% coverage over unrestricted text ob-
tained from online sources. The lexicon has
been implemented in Lexical Mark up Frame-
work.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979983870968">
The availability of lexical resources is central to
many natural language processing tasks as words
play a crucial role in defining higher level con-
structions such as phrases, clauses and sentences
of any language. The most generic and basic
lexical resource for such work is a lexicon, pref-
erably with part of speech annotation and infor-
mation about possible word forms. The latter is
important especially for morphologically rich
languages such as Sinhala. This kind of resource
is extremely useful for part of speech tagging,
grammar development and parsing, machine
translations, speech processing applications,
among others. As new knowledge is created, new
concepts are introduced to the language in terms
of words. Non-corpus-based lexicon develop-
ment approaches are not capable of acquiring
these new words into lexica due to their inherent
limitations such as reliance on introspection and
linguistic exposure of the human compiler(s).
Therefore it is essential to adopt less expensive
(less time consuming, labor intensive and robust)
alternative strategies to develop wide-coverage
lexica for less studied languages.
This paper presents a lexicon for Sinhala which
has nearly 35,000 entries based on the text drawn
from the UCSC Text Corpus of Contemporary
Sinhala consisting of 10 million words from di-
verse genres. The corpus-based approach taken
in this work can overcome the limitations that
traditional approaches suffering from such as less
reliance on less expert knowledge, the ability to
capture modern usage based on recently intro-
duced words and wide coverage.
The lexical entries defined in this approach are
classified according to a novel classification in
order to fulfill the requirements of language
processing tasks. The broad classes defined are
significantly different from those described in
traditional Sinhala grammar. For declensional
classes such as Nouns and Verbs, further subdi-
visions have been proposed based on their mor-
pho-phonemic features. Each of the subdivision
classes is associated with a set of rules that can
be used to generate all possible morphological
forms of that group. This has made a significant
contribution to improve the coverage of the lexi-
con as for a given lexical entry it is hard to guar-
antee that all possible forms exist in the original
corpus. However, the rules defined in each class
guarantee recognize such unseen forms in the test
data set.
In addition, a comprehensive set of function
words has been defined based on some of the
indeclinable classes such as Post-positions, Parti-
cles, Determiners, Conjunctions and Interjec-
tions. The lexicon also consists of the most
commonly used named entities such as person
and city names. Syllabified phonetic transcrip-
tions of the lexical entries are also incorporated
in order to make this resource useful in speech
processing applications.

These characteristics are essential in building
effective practical natural language processing
applications. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first attempt to build a wide coverage lexi-
con for Sinhala from a computational linguistic
perspective reported in the literature.
The rest of the paper describes the work carried
out in detail. Section 2 gives a detailed descrip-
tion of the data acquisition stage, the part of
speech categories and the subdivisions based on
morphology and the phonetic transcription with
syllabification. The implementation details of the
lexicon and schemas defined for lexical entries
using Lexical Mark up Framework (LMF) is
given in Section 3. Section 4 comments on the
results of the experiments conducted to measure
the coverage of the lexicon. Finally, Section 5
discusses the issues and limitations of the current
work with insights for future work.

<bodyText confidence="0.999317777777778">
The data for the lexicon was obtained from the
UCSC Sinhala Corpus which has text drawn
from diverse genres namely, Creative Writing,
Technical Writing and News Reportage. The
corpus represents the modern usage of Sinhala in
the above mentioned genres. This guarantees the
robustness of the lexicon in practical language
processing applications. The text distribution
across genres in the corpus is given in Table 1.

It is clear from the Table 1 that the corpus is
fairly balanced across genres while Creative
Writing and Technical Writing genres respec-
tively make the lowest and the highest contribu-
tions to the total word count of the corpus.
In order to extract the candidate words for the
lexicon, a distinct word list with frequencies was
obtained by running a simple tokenizer on the
corpus text. Misspelt and irrelevant tokens (num-
bers, foreign words, etc) were removed from the
list after manual inspection. Further, the resultant
words were manually classified into their respec-
tive parts of speech for subsequent processing
based on a predefined classification. This was
carried out by a team of five members including
one senior linguist. At the initial stage of this
phase, a substantial effort was made to train the
manual classifiers to classify words according to
the predefined set of classification criteria. In
order to automate this process, the high fre-
quency words were first classified into their re-
spective parts of speech and then certain word
ending patterns peculiar to each class were iden-
tified. These patterns were used to classify the
rest of the list automatically by running regular
expression matching followed by manual clean-
ing. This strategy significantly accelerated the
data acquisition process.
In addition to the words taken from the corpus, a
comprehensive list of named entities such as per-
son, village/city, country, capital, product names
was added to the lexicon after processing data
sources obtained from the Departments of Cen-
sus &amp; Statistics and Inland Revenue. These en-
tries were absorbed into the lexicon on the basis
of complete enumeration.

2.2 Parts of Speech and Morphology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993444444445">
In traditional Sinhala grammar, several classifi-
cations have been proposed for parts of speech.
This is mainly due to the existence of different
grammatical schools in Sinhala language studies.
They can be broadly classified into three main
categories namely, notions based on Sanskrit
grammar (Dharmarama, 1913), ideas inspired by
language purism significantly different from
those based on Sanskrit grammar (Kumaratu-
naga, 1963), and classifications proposed in the
light of modern linguistics (Karunatilake, 2004).
From a computational linguistic point of view,
each of these classifications while having their
own strengths is unable to capture phenomena
which are useful for computational linguistics.
They are mainly descriptive treatments of lan-
guage which are used for pedagogical purposes
whereas a computational model requires a formal
analytical treatment in order to be of any use.
Due to the limitations of the existing classifica-
tions of Sinhala words, a novel classification of
part-of-speech categories was developed after
studying the existing classifications closely; con-
sulting linguists and reviewing part of speech tag
set design initiatives for other Indic languages.
Widely accepted and used tag sets for English
were also taken into account when proposed

classification was developed. As described in
section 1, the current classification has improved
the predictive power of each class and this has in
turn improved the coverage that is essential for
robustness of the lexicon in computational lin-
guistic and natural language processing tasks.

and their Frequencies
Table 2 shows the thirteen broad classes of parts
of speech used in the proposed lexicon. Names of
these categories are self-explanatory except for
Verb Particle which stands for a category of
words that are used in Sinhala compound verbs,
exemplified best by the terms ඉකුත් (Sinhala:
ikuth, Sanskrit: athikräntha), පත් (Sinhala: path,
Sanskrit: präptha), and පළ (Sinhala: pala, San-
skrit: prakata). Most of these Verb Particles are
localized forms of past participle forms of some
Sanskrit verbs. For some historical reason, only
past participle forms of these verbs are present in
modern usage of Sinhala but not the other forms.
According to the frequency distribution of parts
of speech categories given in Table 2, it is clear
that nearly 50% of the lexical entries are Proper
Nouns. Overall 85% of the total number of en-
tries is nouns with only 3% being Verbs. This is
mainly due to the fact that Sinhala has many
compound verbs. Compound verbs are usually
formed by using Nouns, Adjectives, Verb Parti-
cles and Participles of some verbs together with
the helper verbs such as කරනවා (English: do),
ෙවනවා (English: be), ෙදනවා (English: give),
ගන්නවා (English: take), and දානවා (English: put).
As this contextual information is absent it is hard
to determine whether a particular noun or adjec-
tive or any other word has occurred as a constitu-
ent of a compound verb or not. Therefore they
were classified as if they occurred in their pri-
mary category.
Even though the number of entries under Verb
category is relatively small i.e. nearly 3%, it was
found that the number of instances of those verbs
is significantly high. In the distinct word list ob-
tained from the original corpus, 4.64% of the
entries were verbs (including inflected forms).
The total number of instances of verbs (including
inflected forms) in the corpus is 19.4% of the
total number of words in the corpus. This implies
that 3% of the lexicon has coverage of nearly
20% of the corpus. In addition, it was found that
27.7% of the verbs in the corpus are compound
verbs since verbs that are essentially part of
compound verbs (කරනවා, ෙවනවා, ෙදනවා, ගන්නවා,
දානවා) have occurred 27.7% of the corpus.
It was also possible to identify a set of words
which plays only functional roles in Sinhala sen-
tences and have no lexical meaning. In the tradi-
tional treatments of grammar they are classified
as nipa:tha which literally means “things that fall
in either initial or medial or final position of a
sentence to express the relationships among ele-
ments of the sentence”. This definition does not
take into account the different functional roles
played by those words and therefore classifies
them into one single class called nipa:tha. In the
work described here, these words were classified
into five classes namely, Postpositions, Particles,
Conjunctions, Determiners and Interjections. A
list of 440 words that belong to these five classes
form the first function (stop) word list reported
for Sinhala. Identifying the function words is
important for applications such as information
retrieval, prosody modeling in speech synthesis,
semantic role labeling, and dependency parsing.
Nouns and Verbs are further classified into sub-
classes according to their inflectional/declension
paradigms given in Table 3 and 4. These sub-
classes are mainly specified by the morpho-
phonemic characteristics of stems/roots.

Nouns are primarily classified with respect to the
phone type of the final position of the stem: Con-
sonant-1 and Consonant-2 classes have stems
that have a consonant ending. The difference be-
tween these two classes is defined by the phono-
logical changes that take place when nominal and
accusative suffixes are added to the stem. The
noun stems belong Consonant-1 has the plural
suffix (-u) and their final position consonant is
reduplicated when the suffix is appended
whereas noun stems belong to Consonant-2 has
null suffix to mark plurality.
The noun stems that belong to Consonant Redu-
plication have either vowel /i/ or /u/ at the final
position. When a nominative or accusative suffix
(-a: / -O: / -an) is appended to the noun stem the
final position vowel is deleted and the penulti-
mate non-retroflex consonant is reduplicated. If
the consonant is retroflex they are classified un-
der Retroflex-1. If the noun stems that have
vowel /ə/ at the final position and the penultimate
consonant is retroflex then the vowel is deleted
and the nominative or accusative suffix is ap-
pended to the remaining part of the stem. This
class is named as Retroflex-2.
When a nominative or accusative suffix is ap-
pended to a noun stem that belongs to Front-Mid
Vowel subclass, the semi-consonant /y/ is in-
serted between the noun stem and the suffix.
Similarly, /w/ is inserted if the noun stem belongs
to Back Vowel category.Kinship and Uncount-

2.3 Phonetic Transcriptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934444444444">
Sinhala orthography is relatively unambiguous as
each character corresponds to a unique speech
sound. However there are a few ambiguous cases
that have to be resolved by taking the context
into account. Though Sinhala orthography has
different symbols to denote aspirated and un-
aspirated consonants, in present usage aspiration
is not present. Similarly, the alveolar consonants
such as ළ (/l/) and ණ (/n/) are now pronounced as
their dental counterparts a and m. Schwa epen-
thesis also plays a crucial role in Sinhala pronun-
ciation as it leads to significant meaning changes
of Sinhala words.
Having considered all these issues, it was de-
cided to incorporate phonetic transcriptions of
lexical entries in order to make the current lexi-
con general purpose. This piece of information is
very useful for speech synthesis and recognition
application development. Syllabified phonetic
transcriptions were automatically derived by ap-
plying the grapheme to phoneme (G2P) rules and
the syllabification algorithm described in (Wa-
sala et al, 2006) and (Weerasinghe et al, 2005)
respectively that report 98% on G2P and 99%
accuracy on syllabification. All phonetic tran-
scriptions are given in International Phonetic Al-
phabet (IPA) symbols.

As shown in Figure 1, a typical noun entry has
main part of speech category (partOfSpeech),
sub category (subClass). Each Lemma has two
feature attributes namely citation form and pro-

There is a significant difference between the
coverage reported on the Distinct Wordlists ob-
tained from Un-cleaned and Cleaned datasets
that is 60% to 72% in Creative Writing, 58% to
70% in Technical Writing and 55% to 71% in
News Reportage. This consistent difference
proves that a significant number of the words
that could not be found in the lexicon were oc-
curred only once in the test data set.
Relatively higher coverage can be achieved when
the full text is used rather than a distinct list of
words. As high frequency words occur in text
more than once in practical situations the lexicon
covers a large area of the text though it cannot
recognize some low frequency words in the text.
This is evident from the differences of coverage
reported on Distinct Wordlists and Full Text for
both un-cleaned and cleaned data sets (see Table
7). Around 20% coverage difference between
Distinct Wordlist and Full Text was reported for
each genre.
The average coverage of the lexicon was com-
puted by averaging the coverage reported for
three different genres on un-cleaned full-text
(FT) data set, which is 80.9%.
In addition, a similar experiment was conducted
to measure the significance of the classification
proposed in the current work. In that experiment,
the coverage of the lexicon was measured by tak-
ing only the word forms occurred in the original
corpus but not all the forms of the words oc-
curred in the original corpus. Then the rules de-
fined in each subdivision of nouns and verbs
were used to generate all possible forms of the
words occurred in the original corpus. This ex-
periment was carried out on the distinct word list
obtained from the un-cleaned data set. The re-
sults show that there were 3.8%, 3.4% and 3.2%
improvements in the coverage of creative writ-
ing, technical writing and news reportage genres
respectively after introducing the generation
rules for each subdivision of nouns and verbs.

Table 9. Different Error Types Distributed
across Three Genres Reported on
Distinct Wordlist (DW) and Full Text (FT)
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918333333333">
It can be concluded from these observations that
the errors that are genre independent occur more
frequently than genre dependent error and they
are the most general mistakes that writers make
in their writings. The typographic errors that
more frequent in Technical Writing and News
Reportage genres are mainly due to the compli-
cations in Sinhala typing and Unicode represen-
tation. As Sinhala Unicode uses Zero Width
Joiner character very often to represent combined
characters typists make errors when typing by
inserting this character incorrectly. It is hard for
them to correct it by deleting that character as it
is invisible to the typist on the computer screen.
It is clear that from the results shown in Table 9
that there is no significant difference between the
error distributions in distinct wordlist and full
text test data.

5 Issues and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979833333333">
The current lexicon has 80% coverage over unre-
stricted text selected from online sources. In or-
der to make this lexicon robust in practical lan-
guage processing applications it is important to
further improve its coverage in different do-
mains.
It was observed that the number of verbs in the
lexicon is relatively small due to the fact that
fairly large numbers of Sinhala verbs are com-
pound verbs. In the future it is expected to incor-
porate those compound verbs so that the cover-
age of verbs of the lexicon is relatively higher.
In the current implementation the word forms of
nouns and verbs are generated by using third
party commercial software. It is expected to in-
corporate a morphological analyzer and genera-
tor so that all the possible word forms can be
generated by the lexicon itself.

<abstract confidence="0.988251">Lexicon is in important resource in any kind of language processing application. Corpus-based lexica have several advantages over other traditional approaches. The lexicon developed for Sinhala was based on the text obtained from a corpus of 10 million words drawn from diverse genres. The words extracted from the corpus have been labeled with parts of speech categories defined according to a novel classification proposed for Sinhala. The lexicon reports 80% coverage over unrestricted text obtained from online sources. The lexicon has been implemented in Lexical Mark up Framework.</abstract>

Schwa epenthesis also plays a crucial role in Sinhala pronunciation as it leads to significant meaning changes of Sinhala words. Having considered all these issues, it was decided to incorporate phonetic transcriptions of lexical entries in order to make the current lexicon general purpose. This piece of information is very useful for speech synthesis and recognition application development. Syllabified phonetic transcriptions were automatically derived by applying the grapheme to phoneme (G2P) rules and the syllabification algorithm described in (Wasala et al, 2006) and (Weerasinghe et al, 2005) respectively that report 98% on G2P and 99% accuracy on syllabification. All phonetic transcriptions are given in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols. 20 3 Implementation The lexicon has been implemented in XML according to the specification given in Lexical Mark-up Framework (Francopoulo et al, 2006) which is now the ISO standard for lexicon development.
