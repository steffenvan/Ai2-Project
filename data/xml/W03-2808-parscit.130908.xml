SENSEVAL is a series of evaluation exer-
cises for Word Sense Disambiguation. The
core design is in accordance with the MUC
and TREC model of quantitative, developer-
oriented (rather than user-oriented) evalua-
tion. The first was in 1998, with tasks for
three languages and 25 participating research
teams, the second in 2001, with tasks for
twelve languages, thirty-five participating re-
search teams and over 90 participating sys-
tems. The third is currently in planning. The
scale of the resources developed is indicated in
Table 1 (reproduced from (Edmonds and Kil-
garriff, 2002)).1
In this paper we address five of the workshop
themes from a SENSEVAL perspective:

One aspect of SENSEVAL of interest here is its
organizational structure. It has no centralised
sponsor to fund or supply infrastructure. Al-
most all work was done by volunteer effort
with just modest local grant funding for par-
ticular subtasks, with organisers answerable
to no-one beyond the community of WSD re-
searchers. This was possible because of the

level of commitment. People wanted the eval-
uation framework, so they were willing to find
the time, from whatever slack they were able
to concoct.
At the SENSEVAL-1 workshop, the possibil-
ity of finding an official sponsor {most likely
the EU or a branch of the US administration{
was discussed at length and vigorously. The
prevailing view was that, while it was nice
to have more money around, it was not nec-
essary and came at a cost. Various experi-
ences were cited where researchers felt their
energies had been diverted from the research
itself to the processes of grant applications,
cost statements, and the strange business of
writing reports which in all likelihood no-one
will ever read. My experience, as co-ordinator
of SENSEVAL-1 and chair of SENSEVAL-2, was
that, without external funding but with great
goodwill and energy for the task at various lo-
cations round the globe, it was possible to get
a vast amount done in a short time, at some
cost to family life but with a minimum of mis-
directed effort.
At several points, potential funders have
said &amp;quot;All you need to do is fill in our form...&amp;quot; It
is always worth asking whether this is a poi-
soned chalice. How much effort will it take
to fill in, and how much more to follow it
through? What is the cost to my engagement
and enthusiasm of doing things their way (as
I shall have to, if I take the king&apos;s shilling, as
good governance demands that procedures are
followed, forms are filled, any changes to the
original plan are justified and documented ...).
I should note that, possibly, my perspective
here is atypical. As the co-ordinator, without

As followers of the literature will
have noted, great strides have been
made in statistical parsing. In two
decades, system performance figures
have soared to over 90%. This
is a magnificent tale. Parsing is
cracked. An enormous debt is owed
to the producers of the Penn Tree-
bank. As anticipated by Don Walker,
marked-up resources were what we
needed. Once we had them, the al-
gorithm boys could set to work, and
whoomph!
The benefits of concentrating on the
one corpus have been enormous. The
field has focused. It has been the mi-
croscope under which the true nature
of language has become apparent.
Like Mendel unpacking the secrets
of all species&apos; genetics through as-
siduous attention to sweet peas, and
sweet peas alone, Charniak, Collins,
and others have unpacked the secrets
of grammatical structure through
rigorous attention to the Wall Street
Journal.
We would now like to point out the
unhelpfulness of comments appear-
a funder as taskmaster, I had a particularly
free hand to ordain as I saw fit. This was
most agreeable, but it is quite possible that
others involved saw me as their (more or less
reasonable, more or less benevolent) dictator
and bureaucracy, and did not share the plea-
sures of autonomy that I experienced.
I am not sure that I advocate the no-
bureaucracy approach: clearly, it depends on
there being some slack somewhere which can
be redirected. It is however a model well worth
considering, if only because it is such fun work-
ing with other committed volunteers for no
better reason than that you all want to reach
the same goal.
2 The re-use trap
Consider the following position (Redux, 2001):
ing on the CORPORA mailing list,
reporting low performance of various
statistical POS-taggers when applied
to text of different types to the train-
ing material, and also of a footnote
to a recent ACL paper, according
to which a leading Penn-Treebank-
trained parser was applied to literary
texts but then its performance &amp;quot;sig-
nificantly degraded&amp;quot;. These results
have not, I am glad to say, entered
beyond that footnote into the scien-
tific literature. The authors should
realise that it is prima facie invalid
to apply a resource trained on one
type of data, to another. Anyone
wishing to use a statistical parser on
a text type for which a manually-
parsed training corpus does not ex-
ist, must first create the training cor-
pus. If they are not willing to do
that, they may as well accept that
ten years of dazzling progress is of
no use to them.
. . .
So now, our proposal. We are encour-
aged to see the amount of work based
on the Wall Street Journal which ap-
pears in ACL proceedings. However
we remain concerned about the quan-
tity of papers appearing there which
fail to use a rigorous methodology,
and fail to build on the progress out-
lined above. These papers tend to
fall outside the domain which has
become the testing ground for our
understanding of the phenomenon of
language, viz, the Wall Street Jour-
nal. Outside the Wall Street Journal,
we are benighted. May I suggest that
ACL adopt a policy of accepting only
papers investigating the language of
the Wall Street Journal.
A similar position was discussed in relation
to SENSEVAL. There was a move to use, in part
or in whole, the same sample of words (ca 40
items) for SENSEVAL-2 (English lexical sample
task) as had been used in SENSEVAL-1. This
would have promoted comparability of results
across the two exercises. However, we were
anxious about continuing to focus our efforts
on just 40 of the 10,000 ambiguous words of
the language, as it seemed plausible that some
issues had simply not arisen in the first sample,
and if we did not switch sample, there was no
chance that they would ever be encountered.
All SENSEVAL resources are in the public
domain and can be (and have been) used by
researchers wanting to compare their system
performance with performance figures as in
SENSEVAL proceedings. Of course such com-
parison will never be fair, as systems compet-
ing under the examination conditions of the
evaluation exercise were operating under time
pressure, and did not always have time to cor-
rect even the most egregious of bugs. However
it is hard to see how the evaluation series can
keep the sheer range and variety of language
use on the agenda if samples are reused.
3 Language flow and the web
You cannot step twice into the same
river, for other waters are constantly
flowing on.
Heraclitus (c. 535-c. 475 BC)
We are currently planning a SENSEVAL-3 task
where the test data will be instances of words
in web pages, as located by a search engine.
Test data will be defined by URL, line num-
ber and byte offset. The goal is to explore
what happens when laboratory conditions are
changed for web conditions. It will support ex-
ploration of how supervised-training systems
perform when test set and training set are no
longer subsets of the same whole. Partipants
will be expected to first retrieve the web page
and then apply WSD to it. This will allow
systems to use a wider context than is possi-
ble in the usual paradigm of short-context test
instances. They could, for example, gather a
corpus of the reference URL, plus any pages it
links to, plus other pages close to it in its di-
rectory tree, in order to identify the domain
of the instance. In general, it makes space
for a range of techniques which the SENSEVAI,
paradigm to date has ruled out.
Clearly, web pages may change or die be-
tween selecting URLs for manual tagging at
set-up time, and the evaluation period, re-
sulting in wasted manual-tagging effort. We
shall minimize the waste by, first, drawing
up a candidate list of URL&apos;s, then, checking
them to see whether they are still available
and unchanged a month or so later. The fact
that some web pages have died will not in-
validate the exercise. It just means there will
be fewer usable test instances than test-URLs
distributed.
One hypothesis to be explored is that
supervised-training systems are less resilient
than other system-types, in the real world situ-
ation where the data to be disambiguated &amp;quot;in
anger&amp;quot; may not match the text type of the
training corpus. The relation between the per-
formance of supervised-training systems in the
laboratory and in the wild is to my mind one
of the critical issues at the current point in
time, given the ascendancy that the paradigm
has achieved in CL.
It may also shed light on the relation be-
tween a linguistic/collocational view of word
senses and one dominated by domain. In-
evitably, for some words, there will be a poor
match between the domains of training-corpus
instances and the domains of web instances.
While this might seem `unfair&apos; and a problem
following from the biases of the web, it is a fact
of linguistic life. The concept of an unbiased
corpus has no theoretical credentials. The task
will explore the implications of working with a
corpus whose biases are unknown, and in any
case forever changing.
The web also happens to be the corpus that
many potential customers for WSD need to
operate on, so the task will provide a picture
of whether WSD technology is yet ready for
these potential clients.

4 SENSEVAh and Machine
Translation evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948340425532">
As noted above, overall SENSEVAI, design is
taken from MUC. We have also followed MUC
and TREC discussions of the hub-and-spokes
model and the need to forever look towards
updating the task, to guard against partici-
pants becoming expert at the task as defined
but not at anything else.
WSD is not a task of interest in itself. One
does WSD in order to improve performance on
some other task. The critical end-to-end task,
for WSD, is Machine Translation (Kilgarriff,
1997).
In SENSEVAI,-2, for Japanese there was a
translation memory task, which took the form
of an MT evaluation (Kurohashi, 2001). In
that experimental design, each system re-
sponse potentially requires individual atten-
tion from a human assessor. As in assess-
ing human or computer translation, one can-
not specify a complete set of correct answers
ahead of time, so one must be open to the
possibility that the system response is cor-
rect but different from all the responses seen
to date. Thus the exercise is potentially far
more expensive than the MUC model. In the
MUC model, human attention is required for
each data instance. In this model, human at-
tention is potentially required for each data-
instance/system combination.
Another consequence is that there is no free-
standing, system-independent gold standard
corpus of correct answers. New or revised sys-
tems cannot simply test against a gold stan-
dard (unless they limit their range of possible
answers to ones already encountered, which
would introduce further biases).
So it is a more complex and costly form
of evaluation. However it is also far more
closely related to a real task. It is a direction
that SENSEVAI, needs to take.2 The MUC-
style fixed-sense-inventory should be seen as
what was necessary to open the chapter on
WSD evaluation: a graspable, manageable
task when we had no experience of the dif-
ficulties we might encounter, which also pro-
vided researchers with some objective datasets
for their development work. For the future the

Consider the (fictional) game show &amp;quot;Couples&amp;quot;.
The idea is to establish which couples share the
same world view to the greatest extent. Each
member of the couple is put in a space where
they cannot hear what the other is saying, and
is then asked twenty multiple-choice questions
like
What is the greatest UK pop group of the
1960s?

The couple that gives the same answer most
often wins.
Different couples get different questions,
sometimes with different numbers of multiple-
choice options, and this introduces a risk of
unfairness. If one couple gets all two-way
choices, while another gets all 13-way choices,
and both agree half the time, the 13-way cou-
ple have really done much better. Random
guessing would have got (on average) a 50%
score for the couple who got the two-way ques-
tions, whereas it would only have got a 1/13
or 7.7% score for the others.
One way to fix the problem is to give, for
each question, not a full point but a score mod-
ified to allow for what random guessing would
have given. This can be defined as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9998595">
P(A) — P(E)
1 — P(E)

<bodyText confidence="0.999576285714286">
where P(A) is the proportion of times they
actually agree, and P(E) is the proportion of
times they would agree by chance.
This is called the Kappa statistic. It was de-
veloped within the discipline of Content Anal-
ysis, and introduced into the HLT world by
Jean Carletta (Carletta, 1996).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.465363">
Inter-Annotator Agreement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988941176471">
For HLT, the issue arises in manual tagging
tasks, such as manually identifying the word
class or word sense of a word in the text, or
the discourse function of a clause. In each of
these cases, there will be a fixed set of possible
answers. Consider two exercises, one where a
team of two human taggers tag a set of clauses
for discourse function using a set of four pos-
sible functions, the other where another team
of two uses a set of fifteen possible functions.
If the first team gave the same answers 77%
of the time, and the second gave the same an-
swers 71% of the time, then, at a first pass,
the first team had a higher agreement level.
However they were using a smaller tagset, and
we can use kappa to compensate for that. The
kappa figure for the first team is

<equation confidence="0.9548695">
0:77 — 1=4 0:52

and that for the second team is

0:71 — 1=15 0:64
1 - 1=15 0:93
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916727272727">
The inter-annotator agreement (IAA) can be
presented as simple agreement figures of 77%
and 71%, or as kappa values of 0.69 in both
cases.
IAA matters to HLT evaluation because hu-
man tagging is what is needed to produced
`gold standard&apos; datasets against which system
performance can be judged. The simplest ap-
proach is for a person to mark up a text,
and to evaluate the system against those tag-
gings. But the person might make mistakes,
and there may be problems of interpretation
and judgement calls where a different human
may well have given a different answer. So, for
gold standard dataset development, each item
to be tagged should be tagged by at least two
people.
How confident can we be in the integrity of
the gold standard? Do we really know that it
is correct? A central consideration is IAA: if
taggers agreed with each other nearly all the
time, we can be confident that, firstly, the gold

standard corpus is not full of errors, and sec-
ondly, that the system of categories, or tags,
according to which the markup took place is
adequate to the task. If the tags are not well-
suited to the task and adequately defined, it
will frequently be arbitrary which tag a tagger
selects, and this will show up in low IAA.

<bodyText confidence="0.999961727272727">
Carletta presented kappa as a better mea-
sure of IAA than uncorrected agreement. In
the specific cases she describes, this is certainly
valid.
Those cases are very specific. Kappa is rel-
evant where the concern is that an IAA figure
based on a small tagset is being compared with
one based on a large tagset. Where that is the
focus of the investigation, kappa is an appro-
priate statistic.
Where it is not, there are arguments for and
against the use of kappa. In its favour is that
it builds in compensation for distortions that
might otherwise go unnoticed resulting from
different tagset sizes.
Against is, principally, the argument that
kappa figures are hard to interpret. A simple
agreement figure is just that: it is clear what
it means, and the critical question of whether,
say, 90% agreement is `good enough&apos; is one
for the reader to form their own judgment on.
With a kappa figure of .85, the reader needs to,
firstly, understand the mathematics of kappa,
and secondly, bear in mind the various com-
plexities of how kappa might have been calcu-
lated (see also below), before forming a judg-
ment. To &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; the reader with this task,
there are various discussions in the literature
as to how different kappa figures are to be in-
terpreted. Sadly, these are contradictory (and
even if they weren&apos;t, it is the duty of any criti-
cal reader to form their own judgment on what
is good enough.)
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.495892">
Complexities in the calculation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999367055555556">
Above we present kappa in its simplest form.
Naturally, when used in earnest additional is-
sues arise. The observations below arose prin-
cipally from the consideration of how we might
use kappa in SENSEVAL. The task was to pro-
duce a gold standard corpus in which words
were associated with their appropriate mean-
ings, with the inventory of meanings taken
from a dictionary.
Firstly, tagset size is assumed to be fixed.
In the SENSEVAL context, there were three is-
sues here.
1. There were two variants of the task: `lex-
ical sample&apos; and `all-words&apos;. In the all-
words variant, all content words in a text
are tagged. Some will be highly polyse-
mous, others not polysemous at all. It
is not clear how to present kappa figures
that are averages across datasets where
the tagset size varies.
In the lexical sample task, first, a sample
of sentences containing a particular word
is identified, and then, only the instances
of that word are tagged, so the issue does
not arise immediately. It does still arise
if a kappa figure is to be computed which
draws together data from more than one
lexical-sample word.
2. In addition to the dictionary senses for
the word, there were two tags, U for
`unassignable&apos; and P for `proper name&apos;,
which were always available as options for
the human taggers. If included, for pur-
poses of calculating kappa, a word that
only has two dictionary senses is classi-
fied as a four-way choice, which seems in-
appropriate, particularly as U and P tags
were quite rare and absent entirely for
some words.
3. There were a number of other `marginal&apos;
senses which, if included in the tag count,
extend it greatly (for some words). In
the SENSEVAL-1, taggers largely worked
within a given word class, so noun in-
stances of Boat were treated separately
from verb instances, but, in e.g., noun
cases where none of the noun instances
fitted, they were instructed to consider
whether any of the verb senses were a
good semantic match (even though they
evidently could not be a syntactic match).
Also some words formed part of numer-
ous multi-word units that were listed in
the dictionary. Where a tagger found
the lexical-sample word occurring within
a listed multi-word unit, the instruction
was to assign that as a sense.
One response to issues 2 and 3 is to use a
more sophisticated model of random guessing,
in which, rather than assuming all tags are
equally likely for the random guesser, we use
the relative frequencies of the different tags as
the basis for a probability model. The method
succeeds in giving less weight to marginal tags,
at the cost of making the maths of the calu-
clation more complex and the output kappa
figures correspondingly harder to interpret.
Secondly, the SENSEVAL tagging scheme
allowed human taggers to give multiple an-
swers, and also allowed multiple answers in the
tagging scheme.
Thirdly, in SENSEVAL the number of hu-
mans tagging an instance varied (according to
whether or not the instance was problematic).
Fourthly, there is a distinction between two
kinds of occasion on which two taggers give
different tags. It may be a problematic case
to tag, or it may be simple human error (such
as a typo). Arguably, simple typos and sim-
ilar are of no theoretical interest and should
be corrected before considering IAA. A related
point is the distinction between agreement lev-
els (between individual taggers) and replica-
bility (between teams of taggers). Where the
concern is the integrity of a gold standard re-
source, replicability is the real matter of in-
terest: would another team of taggers, using
the same data, guidelines and methods, arrive
at the same taggings? A tagging methodology
which guards against simple errors, wayward
individuals, and wayward interpretations will
tend to produce replicable datasets.
All of these considerations can be addressed
using a variant of kappa. My point is that
kappa becomes harder and harder to interpret,
as more and more assumptions and intricacies
are built into its calculation.
Kappa has been widely embraced as an ex-
ample of an aspect of evaluation technology
that carries across different HLT evaluation
tasks, giving a shimmer of statistical sophis-
tication wherever it alights. My sense is that
it is a bandwagon, which HLT researchers have
felt they ought to jump on in order to display
their scientific credentials and ability to use
statistics, which, in many places where it has
been used, has led to little but gratuitous ob-
fuscation.

The prevailing view was that, while it was nice to have more money around, it was not necessary and came at a cost. Various experiences were cited where researchers felt their energies had been diverted from the research itself to the processes of grant applications, cost statements, and the strange business of writing reports which in all likelihood no-one will ever read. My experience, as co-ordinator and chair of was that, without external funding but with great goodwill and energy for the task at various locations round the globe, it was possible to get a vast amount done in a short time, at some cost to family life but with a minimum of misdirected effort.

In the default case, they were split 2:1 between training and test sets. Inter-annotator agreement is generally the average percentage of cases where two (or more) annotators agree, before adjudication.

As followers of the literature will have noted, great strides have been made in statistical parsing. In two decades, system performance figures have soared to over 90%. This is a magnificent tale. Parsing is cracked. An enormous debt is owed to the producers of the Penn Treebank. As anticipated by Don Walker, marked-up resources were what we needed. Once we had them, the algorithm boys could set to work, and whoomph! The benefits of concentrating on the one corpus have been enormous. The field has focused. It has been the microscope under which the true nature of language has become apparent. Like Mendel unpacking the secrets of all species&apos; genetics through assiduous attention to sweet peas, and sweet peas alone, Charniak, Collins, and others have unpacked the secrets of grammatical structure through rigorous attention to the Wall Street Journal. We would now like to point out the of comments appeara funder as taskmaster, I had a particularly free hand to ordain as I saw fit. This was most agreeable, but it is quite possible that others involved saw me as their (more or less reasonable, more or less benevolent) dictator and bureaucracy, and did not share the pleasures of autonomy that I experienced. I am not sure that I advocate the nobureaucracy approach: clearly, it depends on there being some slack somewhere which can be redirected. It is however a model well worth considering, if only because it is such fun working with other committed volunteers for no better reason than that you all want to reach the same goal. 2 The re-use trap Consider the following position (Redux, 2001): ing on the CORPORA mailing list, reporting low performance of various statistical POS-taggers when applied to text of different types to the training material, and also of a footnote to a recent ACL paper, according to which a leading Penn-Treebanktrained parser was applied to literary texts but then its performance &amp;quot;significantly degraded&amp;quot;. These results have not, I am glad to say, entered beyond that footnote into the scientific literature. The authors should that it is facie to apply a resource trained on one type of data, to another. Anyone wishing to use a statistical parser on a text type for which a manuallyparsed training corpus does not exist, must first create the training corpus. If they are not willing to do that, they may as well accept that ten years of dazzling progress is of no use to them. . . . So now, our proposal. We are encouraged to see the amount of work based on the Wall Street Journal which appears in ACL proceedings. However we remain concerned about the quantity of papers appearing there which fail to use a rigorous methodology, and fail to build on the progress outlined above. These papers tend to fall outside the domain which has become the testing ground for our understanding of the phenomenon of language, viz, the Wall Street Journal. Outside the Wall Street Journal, we are benighted. May I suggest that ACL adopt a policy of accepting only papers investigating the language of the Wall Street Journal. A similar position was discussed in relation There was a move to use, in part or in whole, the same sample of words (ca 40 for (English lexical sample as had been used in This would have promoted comparability of results across the two exercises. However, we were anxious about continuing to focus our efforts on just 40 of the 10,000 ambiguous words of the language, as it seemed plausible that some issues had simply not arisen in the first sample, and if we did not switch sample, there was no chance that they would ever be encountered. are in the public domain and can be (and have been) used by researchers wanting to compare their system performance with performance figures as in Of course such comparison will never be fair, as systems competing under the examination conditions of the evaluation exercise were operating under time pressure, and did not always have time to correct even the most egregious of bugs. However it is hard to see how the evaluation series can keep the sheer range and variety of language use on the agenda if samples are reused. 3 Language flow and the web You cannot step twice into the same river, for other waters are constantly flowing on. 535-c. 475 BC) are currently planning a task where the test data will be instances of words in web pages, as located by a search engine. Test data will be defined by URL, line number and byte offset. The goal is to explore what happens when laboratory conditions are changed for web conditions. It will support exploration of how supervised-training systems perform when test set and training set are no longer subsets of the same whole. Partipants will be expected to first retrieve the web page and then apply WSD to it. This will allow systems to use a wider context than is possible in the usual paradigm of short-context test instances. They could, for example, gather a corpus of the reference URL, plus any pages it links to, plus other pages close to it in its directory tree, in order to identify the domain of the instance. In general, it makes space a range of techniques which the paradigm to date has ruled out. Clearly, web pages may change or die between selecting URLs for manual tagging at set-up time, and the evaluation period, resulting in wasted manual-tagging effort. We shall minimize the waste by, first, drawing up a candidate list of URL&apos;s, then, checking them to see whether they are still available and unchanged a month or so later. The fact that some web pages have died will not invalidate the exercise. It just means there will be fewer usable test instances than test-URLs distributed. One hypothesis to be explored is that supervised-training systems are less resilient than other system-types, in the real world situation where the data to be disambiguated &amp;quot;in anger&amp;quot; may not match the text type of the training corpus. The relation between the performance of supervised-training systems in the laboratory and in the wild is to my mind one of the critical issues at the current point in time, given the ascendancy that the paradigm has achieved in CL. It may also shed light on the relation between a linguistic/collocational view of word senses and one dominated by domain. Inevitably, for some words, there will be a poor match between the domains of training-corpus instances and the domains of web instances. While this might seem `unfair&apos; and a problem following from the biases of the web, it is a fact of linguistic life. The concept of an unbiased corpus has no theoretical credentials. The task will explore the implications of working with a corpus whose biases are unknown, and in any case forever changing. The web also happens to be the corpus that many potential customers for WSD need to operate on, so the task will provide a picture of whether WSD technology is yet ready for these potential clients. Machine Translation evaluation noted above, overall is taken from MUC. We have also followed MUC and TREC discussions of the hub-and-spokes model and the need to forever look towards updating the task, to guard against participants becoming expert at the task as defined but not at anything else. WSD is not a task of interest in itself. One does WSD in order to improve performance on some other task. The critical end-to-end task, for WSD, is Machine Translation (Kilgarriff, 1997). for Japanese there was a translation memory task, which took the form of an MT evaluation (Kurohashi, 2001). In that experimental design, each system response potentially requires individual attention from a human assessor. As in assessing human or computer translation, one cannot specify a complete set of correct answers ahead of time, so one must be open to the possibility that the system response is correct but different from all the responses seen to date. Thus the exercise is potentially far more expensive than the MUC model. In the MUC model, human attention is required for each data instance. In this model, human attention is potentially required for each datainstance/system combination. Another consequence is that there is no freestanding, system-independent gold standard corpus of correct answers. New or revised systems cannot simply test against a gold standard (unless they limit their range of possible answers to ones already encountered, which would introduce further biases). So it is a more complex and costly form of evaluation. However it is also far more closely related to a real task. It is a direction to The MUCstyle fixed-sense-inventory should be seen as what was necessary to open the chapter on WSD evaluation: a graspable, manageable task when we had no experience of the difficulties we might encounter, which also provided researchers with some objective datasets for their development work. For the future the is also the route we have taken in the WASPS project, which is geared towards WSD for MT (Koeling et al., 2003). emphasis needs to be on assessments such as the Japanese one, related to real tasks. 5 Metric re-use: kappa Consider the (fictional) game show &amp;quot;Couples&amp;quot;. The idea is to establish which couples share the same world view to the greatest extent. Each member of the couple is put in a space where they cannot hear what the other is saying, and is then asked twenty multiple-choice questions like What is the greatest UK pop group of the 1960s? The Beatles/The Rolling Stones or Which month is your oldest nephew/niece&apos;s birthday? Jan/Feb/Mar/Apr/May/Jun/Jul nephew-or-niece The couple that gives the same answer most often wins. Different couples get different questions, sometimes with different numbers of multiplechoice options, and this introduces a risk of unfairness. If one couple gets all two-way choices, while another gets all 13-way choices, and both agree half the time, the 13-way couple have really done much better. Random guessing would have got (on average) a 50% score for the couple who got the two-way questions, whereas it would only have got a 1/13 or 7.7% score for the others. One way to fix the problem is to give, for each question, not a full point but a score modified to allow for what random guessing would have given. This can be defined as is the proportion of times they agree, and is the proportion of times they would agree by chance.</abstract>

<title confidence="0.857354">Inter-Annotator Agreement</title>
<abstract confidence="0.928023518348623">For HLT, the issue arises in manual tagging tasks, such as manually identifying the word class or word sense of a word in the text, or the discourse function of a clause. In each of these cases, there will be a fixed set of possible answers. Consider two exercises, one where a team of two human taggers tag a set of clauses for discourse function using a set of four possible functions, the other where another team of two uses a set of fifteen possible functions. If the first team gave the same answers 77% of the time, and the second gave the same answers 71% of the time, then, at a first pass, the first team had a higher agreement level. However they were using a smaller tagset, and we can use kappa to compensate for that. The kappa figure for the first team is and that for the second team is The inter-annotator agreement (IAA) can be presented as simple agreement figures of 77% and 71%, or as kappa values of 0.69 in both cases. IAA matters to HLT evaluation because human tagging is what is needed to produced `gold standard&apos; datasets against which system performance can be judged. The simplest approach is for a person to mark up a text, and to evaluate the system against those taggings. But the person might make mistakes, and there may be problems of interpretation and judgement calls where a different human may well have given a different answer. So, for gold standard dataset development, each item to be tagged should be tagged by at least two people. How confident can we be in the integrity of the gold standard? Do we really know that it is correct? A central consideration is IAA: if taggers agreed with each other nearly all the time, we can be confident that, firstly, the gold standard corpus is not full of errors, and secondly, that the system of categories, or tags, according to which the markup took place is adequate to the task. If the tags are not wellsuited to the task and adequately defined, it will frequently be arbitrary which tag a tagger selects, and this will show up in low IAA. Reservations Carletta presented kappa as a better measure of IAA than uncorrected agreement. In the specific cases she describes, this is certainly valid. Those cases are very specific. Kappa is relevant where the concern is that an IAA figure based on a small tagset is being compared with one based on a large tagset. Where that is the focus of the investigation, kappa is an appropriate statistic. Where it is not, there are arguments for and against the use of kappa. In its favour is that it builds in compensation for distortions that might otherwise go unnoticed resulting from different tagset sizes. Against is, principally, the argument that kappa figures are hard to interpret. A simple agreement figure is just that: it is clear what it means, and the critical question of whether, say, 90% agreement is `good enough&apos; is one for the reader to form their own judgment on. With a kappa figure of .85, the reader needs to, firstly, understand the mathematics of kappa, and secondly, bear in mind the various complexities of how kappa might have been calculated (see also below), before forming a judgment. To &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; the reader with this task, there are various discussions in the literature as to how different kappa figures are to be interpreted. Sadly, these are contradictory (and even if they weren&apos;t, it is the duty of any critical reader to form their own judgment on what is good enough.) Complexities in the calculation Above we present kappa in its simplest form. Naturally, when used in earnest additional issues arise. The observations below arose principally from the consideration of how we might kappa in The task was to produce a gold standard corpus in which words were associated with their appropriate meanings, with the inventory of meanings taken from a dictionary. size is assumed to be fixed. the there were three issues here. 1. There were two variants of the task: `lexical sample&apos; and `all-words&apos;. In the allwords variant, all content words in a text are tagged. Some will be highly polysemous, others not polysemous at all. It is not clear how to present kappa figures that are averages across datasets where the tagset size varies. In the lexical sample task, first, a sample of sentences containing a particular word is identified, and then, only the instances of that word are tagged, so the issue does not arise immediately. It does still arise if a kappa figure is to be computed which draws together data from more than one lexical-sample word. 2. In addition to the dictionary senses for the word, there were two tags, U for `unassignable&apos; and P for `proper name&apos;, which were always available as options for the human taggers. If included, for purposes of calculating kappa, a word that only has two dictionary senses is classified as a four-way choice, which seems inappropriate, particularly as U and P tags were quite rare and absent entirely for some words. 3. There were a number of other `marginal&apos; senses which, if included in the tag count, extend it greatly (for some words). In taggers largely worked within a given word class, so noun inof treated separately from verb instances, but, in e.g., noun cases where none of the noun instances fitted, they were instructed to consider whether any of the verb senses were a good semantic match (even though they evidently could not be a syntactic match). Also some words formed part of numerous multi-word units that were listed in the dictionary. Where a tagger found the lexical-sample word occurring within a listed multi-word unit, the instruction was to assign that as a sense. One response to issues 2 and 3 is to use a more sophisticated model of random guessing, in which, rather than assuming all tags are equally likely for the random guesser, we use the relative frequencies of the different tags as the basis for a probability model. The method succeeds in giving less weight to marginal tags, at the cost of making the maths of the caluclation more complex and the output kappa figures correspondingly harder to interpret. scheme allowed human taggers to give multiple answers, and also allowed multiple answers in the tagging scheme. number of humans tagging an instance varied (according to whether or not the instance was problematic). is a distinction between two kinds of occasion on which two taggers give different tags. It may be a problematic case to tag, or it may be simple human error (such as a typo). Arguably, simple typos and similar are of no theoretical interest and should be corrected before considering IAA. A related point is the distinction between agreement levels (between individual taggers) and replicability (between teams of taggers). Where the concern is the integrity of a gold standard resource, replicability is the real matter of interest: would another team of taggers, using the same data, guidelines and methods, arrive at the same taggings? A tagging methodology which guards against simple errors, wayward individuals, and wayward interpretations will tend to produce replicable datasets. All of these considerations can be addressed using a variant of kappa. My point is that kappa becomes harder and harder to interpret, as more and more assumptions and intricacies are built into its calculation. Kappa has been widely embraced as an example of an aspect of evaluation technology that carries across different HLT evaluation tasks, giving a shimmer of statistical sophistication wherever it alights. My sense is that it is a bandwagon, which HLT researchers have felt they ought to jump on in order to display their scientific credentials and ability to use statistics, which, in many places where it has been used, has led to little but gratuitous obfuscation. 6 Conclusion Clearly, we would like new HLT evaluation exercises to benefit from evaluation work already done.
