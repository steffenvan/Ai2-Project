Research on dialog systems has so far concen-
trated on interactions between a single user and
a machine. In this paper we identify novel re-
search directions arising from multi-party hu-
man computer interaction, i.e. scenarios where
several human participants interact with a dia-

Most current work on spoken human-computer interac-
tion (HCI) involves dialog systems. In recent years, spo-
ken dialog systems with system initiative have become
more commonplace in commercial telephony applica-
tions, and there have been important advances in mixed
initiative and multi-modal research systems. Telephone-
based systems have made it possible to collect large
amounts of human-computer interaction data, which has
benefited empirical research as well as methods based on
automatic training. In addition, evaluation frameworks
have improved beyond the single utterance accuracy mea-
sures used a decade ago to dialog-level subjective and
quantitative measures (Walker et al., 1998).
As dialog systems have advanced, a new area of re-
search has also been developing in automatic recog-
nition and analysis of multi-party human-human spo-
ken interactions, such as meetings, talk shows, court-
room proceedings, and industrial settings (Cohen et al.,
2002). Multi-party interactions pose challenges for
speech recognition and speaker tracking because of fre-
quent talker overlap (Shriberg et al., 2001), noise and
room reverberation, but they also introduce new chal-
lenges for discourse modeling. Until recently, empirical
research was only possible using single-speaker and di-
alog corpora, but now there are many hours of data be-
ing collected in multi-talker environments (Morgan et al,
2001; Schultz et al, 2001).
While many challenges remain in dialog systems –
from error handling and user modeling to response gen-
eration – technology has advanced to the point where
one can also envision tackling the combined problem of
multi-party human-computer interaction. A key motiva-
tion for research in such a domain is supporting human-
human collaboration. We envision a scenario where a
computer plays a role as a conversational agent, much as
in a dialog system, except that it interacts with multiple
collaborating humans. The human participants may be
at distributed locations, perhaps with small subgroups at
each location, possibly with different platforms for input
and output. For example, one might imagine a group of
people in a facility with high-end computers interacting
with workers in the field with lightweight communication
clients, using the computer assistant to help gather vital
information or help plan a transportation route. A key dif-
ference from previous work in such scenarios is the idea
of computer initiative. The computer as a participant also
significantly changes the focus of research relative to that
involved in transcription and analysis of meetings, from
work aimed at indexing and summarization to a focus on
interaction.
Besides the application-oriented motivation for re-
search on multi-party human-computer interaction, the
scenario provides a useful technology pull. In current
dialog systems, there is a disincentive to explore user
initiative, simply because much better accuracy can be
achieved by “controlling” the dialog. However, it would
be impractical for a system to try to constrain the in-
puts from a group of users. Secondly, current dialog sys-
tems generally assume a fixed platform, and hence the re-
sponse generation can be greatly simplified. With varying
platforms and participants with different needs, a more
complex output rendering strategy will be needed, which
will also have implications for future dialog systems as
well. In the follow section, we expand on these issues
and many more research questions that arise in the con-
text of multi-party HCI research.

2 RESEARCH ISSUES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957800000001">
Some of the most intensively pursued research questions
in single-party human-computer interaction are the fol-
lowing: initiative strategies (human vs. system vs. mixed
initiative); dialog planning, in particular the possibility
of learning probabilistic dialog models from data; han-
dling recognition/understanding errors and other system
failures or miscommunications; user modeling, i.e. find-
ing models of interaction patterns specific to certain
users in order to adapt the dialog system; and multi-
modal input/output strategies. A multi-party scenario ex-
tends these questions in various interesting ways but also
presents entirely new challenges, such as described be-
low.
Initiative. It needs to be asked how human-human
communication affects interaction with an automatic di-
alog system on the one hand, and how the presence of
the system influences communication among the human
participants on the other. Specifically, how is the fre-
quency and type of each user’s interaction with the sys-
tem determined? Does every user address the system on
a “first come, first speak” basis, do users take turns, or do
they first communicate among themselves and then inter-
act with the system via a designated “proxy” speaker?
How do these different interaction protocols affect the
outcome? For instance, communicative goals might be
achieved more frequently and more rapidly when the pro-
tocol is fixed in advance but users might be more satisfied
with a less structured interaction.
Two other questions are closely tied to the issue of in-
teraction and initiative protocols: (a) should the system
be an open-mike dialog system, i.e. able to record ev-
erything at all times, though responding only to specific
events? and (b) are users in the same physical location
or are they distributed (e.g. in videoconferencing)? In the
case of an open-mike system, special provisions need to
be made to distinguish between utterances addressed to
the dialog system and utterances that are exclusively part
of the human-human interaction. This additional chal-
lenge is offset by the possibility of gathering useful back-
ground information from the participants’ conversation
that might enable the system to better respond to queries.
Dialog Modeling. Distributed scenarios, where differ-
ent subgroups of participants are separated from each
other physically, will typically lead to parallel subdialogs
evolving in the course of the interaction. In this case
the system needs to be able to track several subdialogs
simultaneously and to relate them to each other. The
possibility of having multiple concurrent subdialogs di-
rectly affects the dialog planning component. Different
user queries and dialog states might need to be tracked
simultaneously, and formal models of this type of in-
teraction need to be established. Recently, probabilis-
tic models of human-computer dialogs have become in-
creasingly popular. The most commonly used paradigm
is that of Markov decision processes and partially observ-
able Markov decision processes, where the entire dialog
is modelled as a sequence of states and associated actions,
each of which has a certain value (or reward) (Singh et
al., 1999; Roy et al., 2000). The goal is to to choose that
sequence of actions which maximizes the overall reward
in response to the user’s query. States can be thought
of as representing the underlying intentions of the user.
These are typically not entirely transparent but only indi-
rectly (or partially) observable through the speech input.
Multi-party dialogs might require extensions to this and
other modeling frameworks. For instance, it is unclear
whether multiple parallel subdialogs can be modelled by
a single state sequence (i.e. a single decision process), or
whether multiple, partially independent decision process
are required. The issue of how to acquire data to train
these models is a further problem, since parallel subdi-
alogs tend to occur spontaneously and can often not be
elicited in a natural way.
Error handling. The prevention and repair of system
errors and miscommunications may take on an entirely
new shape in the context of multi-party interactions.
First, the notion of what constitutes an error may change
since some participants might interpret a particular sys-
tem response as an error whereas others might not. Sec-
ond, the inherent susceptibility of the system to recogni-
tion and understanding errors will be higher in a group
than when interacting with a single user since both the
speech input and the interaction style exhibit greater vari-
ation. Third, error recovery strategies cannot necessarily
be tailored to a single user but need to take into account
the input from multiple participants, such as the sponta-
neous and possibly diverging reactions to a system recog-
nition error. Studies on different reactions to system er-
rors (e.g. building on related studies in single-party HCI
(Oviatt et al., 1998)) should be included in a roadmap for
multi-party HCI research.
User Modeling. User modeling has recently gained in-
creased importance in the field of dialog systems re-
search, as evidenced by the growing number of dialog-
related publications in e.g. the International Conference
on User Modeling, and the User Modeling and Adap-
tation journal. When multiple users are present, several
concurrent user models need to be established, unless in-
teraction is restricted to a proxy scenario as described
above. Here, too, the question is not only what individual
models should look like, but also how they can be learned
from data. Group interactions are typically dominated by
a small number of active speakers, whereas the remaining
participants provide fewer contributions, such that multi-
party data collections tend to be rather unbalanced with
respect to the amount of data per speaker. Furthermore,
individual users might behave differently in different sce-
narios, depending e.g. on other participants in the group.
Flexible “Multi” Input/Output. Research on multi-
modal input/output for language-based dialog systems is
a relatively new field, though many contributions have
been made in recent years. Many developments will im-
pact both dialog and multi-party systems, but introducing
the multi-party dimension brings further challenges. For
example, the problem of coordinating speech and gesture
from one person is complicated by increasing the number
of people, making the problem of speaker tracking impor-
tant. For speech input, there are questions of whether to
use an open-mike system, as mentioned earlier, but there
may also be different requirements for participants with
distributed platforms/locations (e.g. noisy environments
may require push-to-talk). One could envision haptic de-
vices controlled simultaneously be multiple users. On the
output side, there is a problem of incorporating backchan-
nels and visual evidence of attentiveness (equivalent to
head nods), as well as turn-taking and interruption cues
for coordinating with other human speech. Coordina-
tion of different output modalities faces an added chal-
lenge when some platforms/environments preclude use
of all modalities. Considering language alone, the re-
sponse generator must provide alternatives depending on
whether voice output is available and on display size (i.e.
how much text and/or visual aids can be included). User
and context modeling should also impact response gener-
ation.

In order to study the research questions addressed above
we need appropriate resources. Currently, no publicly
available corpus of multi-party human-machine interac-
tions exists. Several corpora of human-human communi-
cation are available and may be used to study phenomena
such as negotiation of turn-taking but are clearly not suf-
ficient to support work on multi-party HCI.
Data collection mechanism. It would be desirable
to collect several corpora of multi-party human-
machine communication, representing different scenar-
ios, e.g. corporate meetings, remote collaboration of sci-
entific teams, or, remaining closer to existing scenarios,
collaborative travel planning of business partners. Care
should be taken to collect data from groups of various
sizes, co-located as well as distributed teams, technolog-
ically experienced vs. inexperienced users, different in-
put modalities, and teams working on a variety of dif-
ferent tasks. Ideally, data collection should be coordi-
nated across different sites with complementary exper-
tise. Data collections should be made available publicly,
e.g. through LDC. Existing multi-party recording facili-
ties (such as instrumented meeting rooms) could be lever-
aged for this effort.
New Evaluation Paradigms. One of the most impor-
tant research questions is how to evaluate the success of
multi-party HCI. Can we build on existing frameworks
for single-person dialogs? For example, can we extend
the Paradise framework (Walker et al., 1998) by introduc-
ing new quantitative measures (such as speaker tracking
error, computer interruption rate) and designing group
questionnaires or averaging responses to individual ques-
tionnaires? As in dialog system research, component-
level evaluations will continue to be a key driver of re-
search progress, but a multi-party system would likely
include new components relative to a dialog system. For
example, a natural task for the computer might be infor-
mation retrieval (IR), in which case there measures from
the IR community would be relevant. Additionally, we
can incorporate insights from more general (i.e. not nec-
essarily speech-specific) evaluation frameworks for col-
laborative systems (Drury et al, 1999; Damianos et al,
2000), which take into account factors such as group size,
social interaction parameters, and collaborative tasks.
Multi-party HCI represents a substantial step beyond
current research, but it is an important challenge that will
drive new ideas in many areas. Since multi-party HCI is
fundamentally about collaboration, it is an ideal problem
for fostering the type of multi-site and multi-discipline
interactions that will advance human communication
