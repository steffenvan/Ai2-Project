<bodyText confidence="0.999585178571429">
Word sense disambiguation for
unrestricted text is one of the most difficult
tasks in the fields of computational
linguistics. The crux of the problem is to
discover a model that relates the intended
sense of a word with its context. This
paper describes a general framework for
adaptive conceptual word sense
disambiguation. Central to this WSD
framework is the sense division and
semantic relations based on topical
analysis of dictionary sense definitions.
The process begins with an initial
disambiguation step using an MRD-
derived knowledge base. An adaptation
step follows to combine the initial
knowledge base with knowledge gleaned
from the partial disambiguated text. Once
the knowledge base is adjusted to suit the
text at hand, it is then applied to the text
again to finalize the disambiguation result.
Definitions and example sentences from
LDOCE are employed as training materials
for WSD, while passages from the Brown
corpus and Wall Street Journal are used for
testing. We report on several experiments
illustrating effectiveness of the adaptive
approach.

<bodyText confidence="0.99785366">
Word sense disambiguation for unrestricted text
is one of the most difficult tasks in the fields of
computational linguistics. The crux of the
problem is to discover a model that relates the
intended sense of a word with its context. It
seems to be very difficult, if not impossible, to
statistically acquire enough word-based
knowledge about a language necessary to build a
robust system capable of automatically
disambiguating senses in unrestricted text. For
such a system to be effective, a great deal of
balanced materials must be assembled in order
to cover many idiosyncratic aspects of the
language. There exist three issues in a
lexicalized statistical word sense disambiguation
(WSD) model - data sparseness, lack of a level
of abstraction, and static learning strategy.
First, word-based models have a plethora of
parameters that are difficult to estimate reliably
even with a very large corpus. Under-trained
models lead to low precision. Second, word-
based models lack a degree of abstraction that is
crucial for a broad coverage system. Third, a
static WSD model is unlikely to be robust and
portable, since it is very difficult to make a
single static model relevant to a wide variety of
unrestricted texts. Recent WSD systems have
been developed using word-based model for
specific limited domain to disambiguate senses
appearing in usually easy context (Leacock,
Towell, and Voorlees 1996) with a lot of typical
salient words. For unrestricted text, however,
the context tends to be very diverse and difficult
to capture with a lexicalized model, therefore a
corpus-trained system is unlikely to port to new
domains and run off the shelf.
Generality and adaptiveness are therefore
key to a robust and portable WSD system. A
concept-based model for WSD requires less
parameter and has an element of generality built
in (Liddy and Paik 1993). Conceptual classes
make it possible to generalize from word-
specific context in order to disambiguate a word
sense appearing in a particularly unfamiliar
context in term of word recurrences. An
adaptive system armed with an initial lexical and
conceptual knowledge base extracted from
machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs), has two
strong advantages over static lexicalized models
trained using a corpus. First, the initial

precisely. Second, based on the result of initial
disambiguated text. Subsequently, the
knowledge base is adjusted to suit the text at

disambiguation, an adaptation step is taken to
make the knowledge base more relevant to the
task at hand, leading to broader and more
precise WSD.
Figure 1 lays out the general framework for
an adaptive conceptual WSD approach, under
which this research is being carried out. The
learning process described here begins with a
step of knowledge acquisition from MRDs.
With the acquired knowledge, the system reads
the input text and starts the step of initial
disambiguation. Adaptive step follows to
combine the initial knowledge base with
knowledge gleaned from the partially
applied to the text again to finalize the
disambiguation result. For instance, Figure 1
shows the initial contextual representation (CR)
extracted from the Longman Dictionary of
Contemporary English (Protor 1978, LDOCE)
for the GEO-bank sense contained both lexical
and conceptual information: (land, river,
lake, ...} u {GEO, MOTION, ...} . The initial
CR is informative enough to disambiguate a
passage containing a deer near the river bank in
the input text. The initial disambiguation step
produces sense tagging of deer/ANIMAL and
bank/GEOGRAPHY, but certain instances of
bank are left untagged for lack of relevant WSD

knowledge. For instance, the GEO-bank sense
in the context of vole is unresolved since there is
no information linking ANIMAL context to
GEOGRAPHY sense of bank. The adaptation
step adds deer and ANIMAL to the contextual
representation for GEO-bank. The enriched
CR therefore contains information capable of
disambiguating the instance of bank in the
context of vole to produce final disambiguation
result.

2 Acquiring Conceptual Knowledge
from MRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999517666666667">
In this section we apply a so-called TopSense
algorithm (Chen and Chang 1998) to acquire CR
for MRD senses. The current implementation
of TopSense uses the topical information in
Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English
(McArthur 1992, LLOCE) to represent WSD
knowledge for LDOCE senses. In the
following subsections we describe how that is
done.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.989748">
2.1 Contextual Representation from
MRDs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989371">
Dictionary is a text whose subject matter is a
language. The purpose of dictionary is to
provide definitions of word senses, and in the
process it supply knowledge not just about the
language, but the world (Wilks et al. 1990). A
good-sized dictionary usually has a large
vocabulary and good coverage of word senses
useful for WSD. However, short MRD
definitions and examples per se lack a level of
abstraction to function effectively as a
contextual representation of word sense. On
the other hand, the thesaurus organizes word
senses into a fixed set of coarse semantic
categories and thus could potentially be useful
as the basis of a conceptual CR of word sense.
To get the best of both worlds of dictionary and
thesaurus, we propose to link an MRD sense to
thesaurus categories to produce conceptual
representation of its context. Content words
extracted directly from the definition sentence of
a word sense can be put to use as the word-level
contextual representation of that particular word
sense.
One way of producing such conceptual CR
is to link MRD senses to their relevant thesaurus
senses and categories. These links furnish the
MRD senses with information necessary for
building a conceptual CR. We will describe
one such approach under which each MRD
sense is linked to a relevant thesaurus sense
according to its defining words. The linked
thesaurus sense, unlike the isolated MDR sense,
falls within a certain semantic category.
Consequently, we can establish relations
between defining words and semantic category
that eventually lead to conceptual CR.
With the word lists in a thesaurus category
cast as a document representing a certain subject
matter or topic, the task of constructing
conceptual representation of context for a certain
MRD sense bears a striking resemblance to the
document retrieval task in information retrieval
(IR) research. Relatively well-established IR
techniques of weighting terms and ranking
documents are applied to build a list of topics
that are most relevant to the definition of each
MRD sense. This list of ranked topics, for a
particular word sense, forms a vectorized
conceptual representation of context in the space
of all possible topics.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99492">
2.2 Illustrative Example
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.935746521739131">
One example is given in this subsection to
illustrate how TopSense works.
Example 1. Conceptual representation of an
LDOCE sense
crane.! .n.1. a machine for lifting and moving
heavy objects by means of a very
strong rope or wire fastened to a
movable arm (JIB).
For the most relevant topics â€¢to fine-grained
sense, we get the following ranked list Hd
(EQUIPMENT), Ha (MATERIALS), Ma
(MOVING).
Furthermore, the definition and examples
of a particular sense on the surface level seldom
are information sufficient to represent context of
the sense. For instance, the words machine, lift,
move, heavy, object, strong, rope, wire, fasten,
movable, arm, jib in the definition of the sense,
crane.1.n.1, are hardly enough contextual
information to resolve a crane.l.n.1 instance in
the Brown corpus shown below:

keening shriek, the anti-aircraft guns coughed
and chattered- and above it all motors roared
and the bombs came whispering and wailing
and crashing down among the ships at anchor at
Bari. They had come from airports in the
Balkans, these hundred-odd Junkers 88&apos;s.
They had winged over the Adriatic, they had
taken Bari by complete surprise and now they
were battering her, attacking with deadly skill.
They had ruined the radar warning system with
their window, they had made themselves
invisible above their flares. And they also had
the lights of the city, the port wall lanterns, and
a shore crane&apos;s spotlight to guide on.
However, with a level of abstraction made
possible by using a thesaurus, it is not difficult
to build a conceptual CR of word sense, which is
intuitively more effective for WSD. For
instance, based on LLOCE topics, the
conceptual CR (EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS,
MOVING) derived from the definition of
crane.1.n.1, is general enough to characterize
many salient words appearing in the context of
the crane.1.n.1 instance, including motor
(EQUIPMENT), lantern (EQUIPMENT), and
flare (EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS).

4.1 Experiment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99951625">
In our experiment, we use the materials of text
windows of 50 words to the left and 50 words to
the right of thirteen polysemous words in the
Brown corpus and a sample of Wall Street
Journal articles. All instances of these thirteen
words are first disambiguated by two human
judges. For these thirteen words under
investigation, only nominal senses are
considered. The experimental results show that
the adaptive algorithm disambiguated correctly
71% and 77% of these test cases in the Brown
corpus and the WSJ sample. Table 1 provides
further details. However, there are still room
for improvement in the area of precision.
Evidence have shown that by exploiting the
constraint of so-called &amp;quot;one sense per
discourse,&amp;quot; (Gale, Church and Yarowslcy 1992b)
and the strategy of bootstrapping (Yarowslcy
1995), it is possible to boost coverage, while
maintaining about the same level of precision.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.974397">
4.2 Discussions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981160541666667">
Although it is often difficult to compare studies
on different text domain, genre and experimental
setup, the approach presented here seems to
compare favorably with the experimental results
reported in previous WSD research. Luk (1995)
experiments with the same words we use except
the word bank and reports that there are totally
616 instances of these words in the Brown
corpus, (slightly less than the 749 instances we
have experimented on). The author reports that
60% of instances are resolved correctly using
the definition-based concept co-occurrence
(DBCC) approach. Leacock et al. (1996)
report that precision rate of 76% for
disambiguating the word line in a sample of
WSJ articles.
One of the limiting factors of this approach
is the quality of sense definition in the MRD.
Short and vague definitions tend to lead to
inclusion of inappropriate topics in the
contextual representation. Using inferior CR, it
is not possible to produce enough and precise
samples in the initial step for subsequent
adaptation.

The experiment and evaluation shows that
adaptation is most effective when a high-
frequency word with topically contrasting senses
is involved. For low-frequency senses such as
EARTH, ROW, and ROAD senses of bank, the
approach does not seem to be very effective.
For instance the following passage containing an
instance of bank has the ROW sense but our
algorithm fails to disambiguate it.
... They slept- Mynheer with a marvelously
high-pitched snoring, the damn seahorse ivory
teeth watching him from a bedside table. In
the ballroom below, the dark had given way to
moonlight coming in through the bank of

now the sky had cleared of scudding black
and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky.
Martha Schuyler, old, slow, careful of foot,
came down the great staircase, dressed in her
best lace-drawn black silk, her jeweled shoe
buckles held forward.
Non-topical sense like ROW-bank can
appeared in many situations, thus are very
difficult to captured using a topical contextual
representation. Local contextual representation
might be more effective.
Infrequent and non-topical senses are
problematic due to data sparseness. However,
that is not specific to the adaptive approach, all
other approaches in the literature suffer the same
predicament. Even with a static knowledge
acquired from a very large corpus, these senses
were disambiguated at a considerably lower rate.

In this section, we review recent WSD literature
from the prospective of types of contextual

Context
</subsectionHeader>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.985228">
5.1.1 Topical Context
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922">
With topical representation of context, the
context of a given sense is reviewed as a bag of
words without structure. Gale, Church and
Yarowslcy (1992a) experiment on acquiring
topical context from substantial bilingual
training corpus and report good results.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.994801">
5.1.2 Local Context
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990866666667">
Local context includes the structured
information on word order, distance, and
syntactic feature. For instance, the local
content of a line from does not suggest the same
sense for the word line as a line for does.
Brown et al. (1990) use the trigram model as a
way of resolving sense ambiguity for lexical
selection in statistical machine translation.
This model makes the assumption that only the
previous two words have any effect on the
translation, thus word sense, of the next word.
The model attacks the problem of lexical
ambiguity and produces satisfactory results,
under some strong assumption. A major
problem with trigram model is that of long
distance dependency. Dagan and Itai (1994)
indicate that two languages are more informative
than one; an English corpus is very helpful in
disambiguating polysemous words in Hebrew
text. Local context in the form of lexical
relations are identified in a very large corpus.
Brown, et al. (1991) describe a statistical
algorithm for partitioning word senses into two
groups. The authors use mutual information to
find a contextual feature that most reliably
indicates which of the senses of the French
ambiguous word is used. The authors report a
20% improvement in the performance of a
machine translation system when the words are
first disambiguated this way.

5.2 Static vs. Adaptive Strategy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991365625">
Of the recent WSD systems proposed in the
literature, almost all have the property that the
knowledge is fixed when the system completes
the training phase. That means the acquired
knowledge never expands during the course of
disambiguation. Gale, et al. (1992a) report that
if one had obtained a set of training materials
with errors no more than twenty to thirty percent,
one could iterate training materials selection just
once or twice and have training sets that had less
than ten percent errors. The adaptive approach
is somehow similar to their idea of incremental
learning and to the bootstrap approach proposed
by Yarowslcy (1995). However, both
approaches are still considered static models
which are changed only in the training phase.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999753714285714">
We have described a new adaptive approach to
word sense disambiguation. Under this
learning strategy, first contextual representation
for each word sense is built from the sense
definition in MRD and represented as a
weighted-vector of concepts represented as word
lists in a thesaurus. Then the knowledge base
is applied to the text for WSD in an adaptive
fashion to improve on disambiguation precision.
We have demonstrated that this approach has the
potential of outperforming established static
approaches. This performance is achieved
despite the fact no lengthy training time or a
very large corpus is required. It is evident that
the WSD algorithms proposed herein are simple,
take up little time and space, and most
importantly, require no human intervention in all
phases of WSD. Sense tagging of training
material, knowledge acquisition from training
data, and disambiguation all are done
automatically.

<abstract confidence="0.99708851724138">Word sense disambiguation for unrestricted text is one of the most difficult tasks in the fields of computational linguistics. The crux of the problem is to discover a model that relates the intended sense of a word with its context. This paper describes a general framework for adaptive conceptual word sense disambiguation. Central to this WSD framework is the sense division and semantic relations based on topical analysis of dictionary sense definitions. The process begins with an initial disambiguation step using an MRDderived knowledge base. An adaptation step follows to combine the initial knowledge base with knowledge gleaned from the partial disambiguated text. Once the knowledge base is adjusted to suit the text at hand, it is then applied to the text again to finalize the disambiguation result. Definitions and example sentences from LDOCE are employed as training materials for WSD, while passages from the Brown corpus and Wall Street Journal are used for testing. We report on several experiments illustrating effectiveness of the adaptive approach.</abstract>

For instance, the GEO-bank sense in the context of vole is unresolved since there is no information linking ANIMAL context to GEOGRAPHY sense of bank. The adaptation step adds deer and ANIMAL to the contextual representation for GEO-bank. The enriched CR therefore contains information capable of disambiguating the instance of bank in the context of vole to produce final disambiguation result. 2 Acquiring Conceptual Knowledge from MRD In this section we apply a so-called TopSense algorithm (Chen and Chang 1998) to acquire CR for MRD senses. The current implementation of TopSense uses the topical information in Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (McArthur 1992, LLOCE) to represent WSD knowledge for LDOCE senses. In the following subsections we describe how that is done. 2.1 Contextual Representation from MRDs Dictionary is a text whose subject matter is a language.

For unrestricted text, however, the context tends to be very diverse and difficult to capture with a lexicalized model, therefore a corpus-trained system is unlikely to port to new domains and run off the shelf. Generality and adaptiveness are therefore key to a robust and portable WSD system. A concept-based model for WSD requires less parameter and has an element of generality built in (Liddy and Paik 1993). Conceptual classes make it possible to generalize from wordspecific context in order to disambiguate a word sense appearing in a particularly unfamiliar context in term of word recurrences. An adaptive system armed with an initial lexical and conceptual knowledge base extracted from machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs), has two strong advantages over static lexicalized models trained using a corpus. First, the initial 237 knowledge is rich and unbiased such that a substantial portion of text can be disambiguated precisely. Second, based on the result of initial disambiguated text.
