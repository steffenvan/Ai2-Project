Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.997676333333333">
Drawing on a growing database of systematic relationships between word-senses,
the authors argue that a significant class of these represent Lexical Implication
Rules, a set of formal rules within the domain of lexical semantics; these they
distinguish from other types of semantic relation more closely dependent on
metaphor and world-knowledge. Some formal properties of Lexical Implication
Rules are proposed, as evidence of their linguistic, rather than real-world, nature.

1. Introduction: Lexical Implication Rules
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999891571428572">
It is a truism that people, in interpreting and producing language, make use of
both linguistic and real-world knowledge. We contend that part of that linguistic
knowledge is a knowledge of lexical semantics. Lexical semantics is discernible
from real- world knowledge, because the inferences used are in certain cases
formally distinct from commonsense inferences and from metaphors based on
analogies. That is the position we attempt to substantiate in this paper.
The focus of this paper is a series of arguments justifying the existence of Lexical
Implication Rules (henceforth &amp;quot;LIRs&amp;quot;). Such rules in principle generate derived
lexical entries from base lexical entries. We contend that they are bona fide rules in
the formal grammar of languages involved; it is wrong to see them as mere
reflections, quasi-systematic effects of applying the formal structures of a
language in a real-world context.
As evidence of this we adduce formal properties of the incidence of some of the
rules. We postulate:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995038375">
• that application of the rules is sometimes blocked by the pre-existing
topography of the lexicon (pre-emption);
• that formal features of the words involved, apparently unrelated to the
semantic effect of the rules, may inhibit LIR application;
• that semantic features of the words input, apparently unrelated to the
semantic effect of the rules themselves , may similarly inhibit LIR application;
• that some rules are specific to particular languages, and indeed to specific
dialects of a given language.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98935075">
All these facts seem incompatible with the hypothesis that LIRs are side-effects of
the the interaction of language use with speakers&apos; knowledge of the real world.
They call for a structured theory of lexical semantics, and this paper is intended as a
contribution to building such a theory.&apos;
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9964725">
1Lexical semantics is nonetheless constrained by the real world, to the extent that (a) real-world
knowledge and analogy will of course be necessary in many cases to give a complete interpretation

The position outlined here arises from current work on the analysis and
categorization of a database of well over 100 instances of predictable lexical and
semantic alternations. These instances of systematic word-sense relationship are
hard to categorize fully, but the majority appear to have properties which show
them not to be mere corollaries of speakers&apos; free play with analogy and terse
assumption of real-world situations. They have something in common with the set
of Lexical Rules used in Lexical Functional Grammar (cf Bresnan (1982)), but are
primarily conceptual rather than syntactic. While it is already clear that there is great
variety in the theoretical status of the rules in this set, we shall argue that there is
clear evidence that at least some of these rules, the LIRs, must be defined as
applying to word-meanings; they are not derivable as generalizations over world-
knowledge, or facts about the world or the society described, but must be stated in
a full grammar of the language in which they occur.
The significance of this is more than a theoretical nicety. It is important to
computational linguistics to include these facts in its lexicon, rather than as a special
kind of world knowledge, since the former will be in general more restricted and
hence more manageable.

1. They are more systematic than the Lexical Network framework used by Norvig
to link the remoter senses of take in Norvig &amp; Lakoff (1987); cf also Norvig
(1989).
2. Each implication instance has a single clear base form. In this they are unlike
the semantic alternations arising from the metaphorical concepts such as &amp;quot;argument
is war&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;communication is a conduit&amp;quot; of Lakoff &amp; Johnson (1980) and Sweetser
(1990), which are often better represented as projections from one network of
semantic relations on to an isomorphic one.
3. They do not depend on special background knowledge, unlike many of the
innovative denominals of Clark &amp; Clark (1979) (e.g.We all Wayned and Cagneyed
).2
4. They are not coerced by a governing head, unlike the instances of contextual
determination (three martinis ago, before the jet engine) pointed out by Fillmore
(p.c.).

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975188142857143">
The form of an LIR may be given schematically as follows, using Cruse&apos;s
terminology (cf Cruse 1986):
A lexical unit LU1, consisting of a lexical component LC1 (consisting of
phonological, orthographic, morphological and syntactic information) and a
semantic component SC1, implies the existence of a lexical unit LU2, with lexical
component LC1 or LC2 and semantic component SC2.
More graphically:

<bodyText confidence="0.999418769230769">
This means that within our definition of LIRs are included all derivational rules,
since these always affect the sense of their input-word.
Note that, on this theory, LIRs may alter the lexical component of an input word,
but they must alter its semantic component. The formal change brought about by an
LIR may be vacuous, but the semantic change can never be. LIRs, therefore, on
our conception, are centrally concerned with semantics, but only incidentally with
formal transformations. Hence, for example, the many lexical processes in
English which involve transition from a count noun to a mass noun (e.g. Tree -
Wood; Animal - Fur; Animal - Meat; Food Item - Mass) will be viewed as
distinct LIRs.
The arrow in the LIR-schema makes it clear that LIRs are viewed as derivational
processes, not as symmetrical relations. The claim is made that each implication
instance has a single clear base form.3 This is not an idle claim, but is in fact
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.978492">
2Historically many LIRs may have begun as post-hoc generalizations over such &amp;quot;contextual&amp;quot;
innovations.

supported by the facts adduced to show the conditions under which LIRs are
blocked (viz by Pre-emption, and by Formally- and Semantically-Based
Exceptions, as exhibited below). Such constraints on the application of a rule
block the existence of a potential output for a given input. Without clear
directionality in the LIRs that are blocked, such constraints would be meaningless,
or at least unspecific in their effect.

4. Our Database and its Usefulness in Lexicography. The Role of Theory.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996045896551724">
Created (by Atkins) in an effort to systematize and accelerate the process of
dictionary compiling, the database draws on the relationships discussed by Fillmore
(e.g. 1969, 1978 and elsewhere) ; Apresjan&apos;s cases of regular polysemy (1973);
Leech&apos;s semantic transfer rules (1981); the verb alternations noted in Levin
(forthcoming); the cases of systematic polysemy discussed in Miller (1978), Clark
&amp; Clark (1979), Aronoff (1980) and Lehrer (1990); items participating in the cross-
language lexicalization patterns which Talmy discusses (1985); the nominal
compounds analysed by Levi (1982); and Pustejovsky&apos;s generative lexicon
(1991).
The database is far from complete. It consists at present of a dBaseIII Plus file, of
which each of the 130 records holds information on one particular type of
systematic meaning shift, and separate lists (as complete as possible) of the sets of
words which participate in each type, and those which might be expected to, but do
not.
At present the lists of words which participate in the various identified meaning
shifts may be used to remind a lexicographer that a particular word is expected to
have certain specified usages, and to structure in advance certain aspects of the
dictionary entry accordingly. In lexicography, when teams of a dozen or so people
work on producing for one dictionary consistent descriptions of 100,000 or more
words, such preparatory marking of items in the wordlist already makes the
compiling faster and more consistent across members of the team. The computer
can present them with an appropriate pro-forma entry to complete, rather than their
having to compile each word from scratch.
But besides these pragmatic aims, we are also concerned to clarify the theoretical
status of the various types of meaning shift. Success here will allow rules to be
formulated more accurately and comprehensively. In addition, by illuminating the
semantic primitives which play a role in the rules, it should also lead towards
standardization of the semantic component of lexical entries.
We now turn to the evidence for LIRs as linguistic rules.

5. Formal Properties of LIRs - 1: Pre-emption
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.761443833333333">
Pre-emption is the prevention of application of a rule because the place for its output
is, in some way, already taken.4 We have noted two kinds of pre-emption
blocking LIRs: semantic pre-emption , where the sense is already represented by a
4Pre-emption is explicitly noted in this context by Clark &amp; Clark (1979: p. 798). Cf also
Gruber (1976: 295-6). These, however, only note the phenomenon of what we call semantic pre-
emption.

Semantic Pre-emption

Hunting Plural is blocked by the pre-existence of the collective plural noun cattle
: *they&apos;re out after ox/cow/bull/bullock.
Vehicle Verb is blocked by the existence of special-purpose verbs drive, sail,fly
(even if these are not strictly accurate statements of the power-source involved):
*we carred/boated/planed home.
Animal Meat is pre-empted by the Anglo-Norman terms beef, mutton, pork, veal,
venison: *have some more gravy on your bullock/sheep/pig/calf/deer.
Power Source Attribute is pre-empted by the adjective electric:
*electricity motor/power/light.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.801274">
Lexical Pre-emption
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.880719666666667">
Dance Verb is blocked in the case of reel because the verb form that would result
is already there with a different meaning, viz &amp;quot;to stagger, as from a shock&amp;quot;. Hence
it is not available to mean &amp;quot;do the (Highland) reel&amp;quot;: *the party reeled the night away.
Although pre-emption of these kinds does appear to be a sufficient condition, and
hence good evidence, for a semantic shift&apos;s being an LIR, it is not apparently a
necessary one: sometimes it fails to work where LIRs do seem to be involved.
For instance, lul Derived Noun creates Contents and Amount senses, sometimes
on the basis of quite unpromising nouns: belly -&gt; a bellyful of rice &amp; beans, cap -
&gt; a capful of disinfectant,fist -&gt; a fistful of dollars, hand -&gt; a handful of dust,
needle -&gt; a needleful of cotton, pocket -&gt; a pocketful of rye, shovel -&gt; a shovelful
of spaghetti, spade -&gt; a spadeful of earth, spoon -&gt; a spoonful of sugar etc.
However, the rule also applies to &apos;true&apos; Container nouns (words whose primary
sense is a hyponym of container): bottle ... -&gt; bottleful, bucketful, cupful, glassful,
potful, sackful, tankful, thimbleful. In these applications, the rule&apos;s semantic effect
seems to be indistinguishable from that of Container - Amount/Contents.
Nonetheless, this latter is not pre-empted e.g. he drank the whole bottle(ful); the
pail holds eight bottle(ful)s of milk.5
Another case of failed pre-emption concerns the LIR Material Adjective. This rule
which allows the names of materials to be used as adjectives to describe objects
made of the material is unaffected by the application of the somewhat sporadic -en
Derived Adjective rule.
E. g. ,
a gold ring vs. a golden ring
a silk shirt vs. a silken shirt
an oak chest vs. an oaken chest
a leather bottle vs. a leathern bottle
5There must be an LIR involved here, and not just a vagueness in the sense of &amp;quot;container nouns&amp;quot;:
the senses Amount and Contents are clearly distinct from the sense Container. To show this it is
enough to point out that nouns like handful and bottleful have the senses Amount and Contents
but not the sense Container.

<bodyText confidence="0.983459375">
For the moment it is enough to point out that pre-emption is not always clear-cut
and co-ercive. Where it is present, however, it indicates clearly the presence of an
LIR.
Pre-emption proper, however, should be distinguished from what we might call
pragmatic exclusion. These are cases where a predicted application of a rule is
blocked because of external fact about the world. Compounding with place-names
can imply Source as well as Destination7: e.g. When is the London train due in? (=
&amp;quot;train from London&amp;quot;) vs. When is the London train due to leave? (=&amp;quot;train for
London&amp;quot;). However, the Source option seems strangely to be excluded for roads.
&amp;quot;The London road&amp;quot; means the road to London, not away from it. The paradox
goes away when one considers the point of view of road users. Either they are in
London, or they are not. If they are, then every road they might take is a road from
London; talking about &amp;quot;the London road&amp;quot; in this sense is of little use to them. If
they are somewhere else, then every road from London is co-extensive with a road
to London: why bother to distinguish? Both sets of road-users can be kept happy if
the convention is adopted that &amp;quot;London road&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;road to London&amp;quot;.

Certain constraints on particular LIRs are quite formal. They have to do with non-
semantic aspects of the lexical items involved, principally their phonological form,
but also their morphological or syntactic sub-category. Such examples provide
perhaps the clearest evidence that LIRs are not an effect of pragmatic attempts to use
words tersely and interpret them constructively.

Constitution - State provides quite generally for mass nouns designating types of
government to act as count nouns designating states under such government.
Hence there is democracy, tyranny, dictatorship, oligarchy, and there are
democracies, tyrannies, dictatorships, oligarchies.8 However, there is one large
class of nouns, those ending in -ism, for which this LIR is blocked: there are no
*fascisms, *communisms, *nazisms, *totalitarianisms, *marxisms, *leninisms,
6Evidently, there is vagueness in the precise definition of the two processes concerned. Some
would say the adjectives in -(e)n are moving away from their original meaning &amp;quot;made of&apos; to
something vaguer such as &amp;quot;redolent of&apos;; others that the outputs of Material Adjective are not
really adjectives, but just compound uses of the original nouns. There are tests that bear on these
points but the results are variable and inconclusive.
70bviously, these possibilities are not exhaustive.
8Some types of regime have no corresponding term for a theory of government e.g. republic,
kingdom, dukedom, heptarchy. . This is because not all regime-terms are derived from terms for
political theories (contrast monarchy (which is) with kingdom (which is not)). In other cases,
the possibility of a corresponding regime is only pragmatically excluded : politics, not grammar,
precludes anarchies, bureaucracies and officialdoms.

Nationality Plural allows for nationality adjectives, when preceded by the definite
article, to also function as terms for a plural noun, referring to a given group of, or
to all people of, that nationality. Strangely, however, the rule is subject to a
phonological restriction: only terms ending in a sibilant consonant are eligible. So
we may refer to the Swiss, the Spanish, the Dutch, the French, the Japanese, but
not (as a collective plural) to *the Belgian, *the German, *the Coptic, *the Iraqi or

Feeling - Evoking applies to adjectives, converting an attribute of a person feeling
an emotion to that of any object causing the emotion. It appears to be systematically
blocked from applying to any adjective which is only used predicatively. Hence we
have the following contrasts:

*a glad child
a fearful child
*an afraid child
a unhealthy child
*an ill child
a rapt child
*an agog child

&apos;Non-naturalized names are another, perhaps semantic, exception. The Hausa, the Wolof, the
Konkani, the Tuareg strike this writer at least as acceptable collective plurals. Interestingly, too,
the Maya seem OK, while the Inca and Chibcha are not.
I &apos;The verb calve instead of the expected *calf is a mild case of pre-emption in Modern
English. The voicing-alternation, however, was once regular, and is merely evidence that the
origins of this LIR go back at least to Middle English.

7. Formal Properties of LIRs - 3: Semantically-Based Exceptions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99908304">
Beside these uncanny exceptions to LIRs based on features of the word-forms
involved, LIRs are also subject to systematic exceptions which pick on features of
the sense. In drawing attention to them, we notice some surprisingly intricate
structure in the lexicon.
Cutter Cut enables nouns representing cutting instruments to be used as verbs.
So people can be knifed, bayoneted, speared, harpooned, axed, tomahawked, or
scythed down; various tools can scissor, drill or saw through material. Why then
do sword, dagger and their hyponyms take no part in this verbal carnage? Why is
it impossible to speak of *swording, *daggering, *poniarding, *bodkinning,
*rapiering, *scimitaring, *sabring, *stilettoing, *claymoring or whatever else one
might do to an adversary with a specific bladed weapon? It begins to look like
more than an accident, since there are plenty of non-derived verbs to cover, in less
specific ways, the stabbing, slashing, chopping, hacking, pricking and piercing
actions that would be connoted.
Another strangely coherent semantic constraint is on Food Item - Mass. This
allows a count noun for food to appear as a mass noun when the units of that food
are not evident. Hence although the primary meaning of the nouns is the discrete
animal, fruit or vegetable, one can nevertheless refer to some egg, some crab,
some salmon, some potato, some carrot, some apple, some cabbage etc., connoting
a mass of the relevant food substance typically on a plate. Only one form of food
seems to resist: pulses. No matter how finely you grind or mash them, you cannot
refer to &amp;quot;*some pea&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;*some bean&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;*some lentil&amp;quot;. Refried beans are still beans,
not bean. Neither of the authors is a native user of garbanzo (a North American
name for chickpea), but we would predict that you cannot have a side-dish of
garbanzo.13

8. Formal Properties of LIRs - 4: Specificity to Language, and to Dialect
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.948116590909091">
Further evidence comes from cases where an LIR appears to be present in one
language, but not in another.
The form of the argument is quite simple: consider two languages (for the sake of
argument, called A and B) and two sets of words, apparently translation equivalents
one for one between the two languages. Suppose that the members of the set in A
all have an extra sense which members of the set in B lack. Such cases are clear
evidence of that the assignment of senses is language-dependent; and the facts are
explained by positing an LIR to be present in A and not in B. The only alternative
would be to appeal to pragmatic interpretation of the context.14 But pragmatics is
a species of commonsense: it cannot explain why the interpretation of vocabulary
differs systematically from one speech-community to another.
13The historical situation here seems a little-muddled, since pea is a singularized back-formation
from pease ,originally a mass-noun meaning peas. This itself seems to have been a reanalysis of
a descendant of an originally plural noun in Latin, pisa . In modern Indian English, dal is used
quite happily as a mass-noun for a different sort of pulses.
14 • -As,
for example, Aronoff (1980: pp.755-7) attempts to explain away the need for specific
details in rules of morphological semantics by appealing to features of the context in
interpretation. His argument is significantly weakened by cases where languages with close
morphological processes (e.g. agent nouns in English and French) apparently show quite different
constraints on their interpretation: e.g. c&apos;est un bon conducteur has no sense synonymous with
the simple il conduit bien ; but cf. he&apos;s a good driver = he drives well.

An example may make the point clearer. In Ancient Greek, there is a set of
adjectives (clearly marked as such morphologically) which associate their head-
noun with a particular time of day. ( E.g. eo:os - at dawn, early; orthrios - in the
morning; mese:mbrinos - at noon; deilinos - in the afternoon; hesperios - in the
evening; nukteros - at night; mesonuktios - at midnight; pannukhios - all night
long). English also has such a set of adjectives but they are few, and confined to a
learned register (e.g. matutinal, nocturnal); the major translation equivalents in
English are attributive uses of nouns (e.g. morning papers, noon-day sun,
afternoon tea etc.). Ancient Greek goes on to use its temporal adjectives
predicatively, with the sense of adverbial qualifiers of the action predicated:
e.g.
orthrios he:ko:n - coming in the morning (Plato, Protagoras 313B)
egre:i mese:mbrinos - you wake at noon (Aristophanes, Wasps 774)
eudon pannukhioi - they slept all night long (Homer, Iliad 2.2)
Evidently, there is no such predicative use of English temporal adjectives or nouns:
prepositional phrases (as used above in the glosses) are the closest that can be
offered.15
Hence there is an adverbial sense of Greek temporal adjectives, used predicatively,
which has no parallel in English. A neat formulation of the case would thus be to
formulate an Ancient Greek LIR, absent in English, which goes:
LIR Time Predication (16)
ADJ : temporal, 4)(head-NP) -&gt; ADJ predicative: tempora1,4:0(head-S)16
To avoid positing an LIR here would take some special pleading. In this case one
would need to argue that the distinction of senses made in English is simply absent
in Greek, so that temporal adjectives are available to do more promiscuous service.
This would amount to saying that Ancient Greek simply made no linguistic
distinction between assigning a time-reference to an action and assigning a time-
reference to the agent of that action.
However, our point here is not to argue for a specific analysis of the Greek facts. It
is simply to point out that sense-shifts of the type that LIRs represent are sometimes
language-specific. Either we can encapsulate the differences in a single LIR,
present in language A, absent in B. Or else we can posit a different assignment of
semantic primitives, with B being systematically stricter in the senses allowed for
a given class of words (-- in this case, English will not allow its temporal
adjectives to assign a time-reference to a whole action). Either way, we shall have
gained some concrete evidence on linguistic semantics. What we are not free to
claim is that pragmatic considerations alone can resolve such systematic differences
between languages.
A similar cross-linguistic argument for the linguistic reality of LIRs can be made
from dialectal differences within the same language.
Consider for example the treatment of &amp;quot;day-nouns&amp;quot; in Standard British English as
against their treatment in various other dialects, including Cockney and General
American. Whereas the indexical nouns today, tonight, yesterday, tomorrow occur
as adverbs in all dialects, the days of the week Sunday through Saturday cannot

occur adverbially in Standard British English: he came *(on) Tuesday. To account
for this, one could posit an LIR Day Noun - Adverb , with a more restricted
domain in Standard British English than in the other dialects.
But to posit this is already to accept that the LIR is a feature of the grammar of
English. Contrastive analysis, whether applying within a language or between
languages, will, we expect, continue to raise a host of problems for any approach
which tries to account for the fine detail of semantics as side-effects of pragmatics.
The real world, and the human condition, is not so different from one language-
community to another (let alone between dialect-areas). But as languages and their
grammars differ, so does their lexical semantics.

The database is far from complete. It consists at present of a dBaseIII Plus file, of which each of the 130 records holds information on one particular type of systematic meaning shift, and separate lists (as complete as possible) of the sets of words which participate in each type, and those which might be expected to, but do not. At present the lists of words which participate in the various identified meaning shifts may be used to remind a lexicographer that a particular word is expected to have certain specified usages, and to structure in adv</context>
