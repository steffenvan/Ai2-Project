Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999325">
In this paper, we present a fully auto-
mated extraction system, named IntEx, to
identify gene and protein interactions in
biomedical text. Our approach is based on
first splitting complex sentences into sim-
ple clausal structures made up of syntactic
roles. Then, tagging biological entities
with the help of biomedical and linguistic
ontologies. Finally, extracting complete
interactions by analyzing the matching
contents of syntactic roles and their lin-
guistically significant combinations. Our
extraction system handles complex sen-
tences and extracts multiple and nested in-
teractions specified in a sentence.
Experimental evaluations with two other
state of the art extraction systems indicate
that the IntEx system achieves better per-
formance without the labor intensive pat-
tern engineering requirement.

connected; the results from sequence analysis and
micro-arrays depend on functional information and
signal transduction pathways cited in peer-
reviewed publications for evidence. Though scien-
tists in the field are aided by many online data-
bases of biochemical interactions, currently a
majority of these are curated labor intensively by
domain experts. Information extraction from text
has therefore been pursued actively as an attempt
to extract knowledge from published material and
to speed up the curation process significantly.
In the biomedical context, the first step towards
information extraction is to recognize the names of
proteins (Fukuda, Tsunoda et al. 1998), genes,
drugs and other molecules. The next step is to rec-
ognize interaction events between such entities
(Blaschke, Andrade et al. 1999; Blaschke, Andrade
et al. 1999; Hunter 2000; Thomas, Milward et al.
2000; Thomas, Rajah et al. 2000; Ono, Hishigaki
et al. 2001; Hahn and Romacker 2002) and then to
finally recognize the relationship between interac-
tion events. However, several issues make extract-
ing such interactions and relationships difficult
since (Seymore, McCallum et al.1999) (i) the task
involves free text – hence there are many ways of
stating the same fact (ii) the genre of text is not
grammatically simple (iii) the text includes a lot of
technical terminology unfamiliar to existing natu-
ral language processing systems (iv) information
may need to be combined across several sentences,
and (v) there are many sentences from which noth-
ing should be extracted.

tion approach to identify gene and protein interact-

1. Complex Sentence Processor (CSP): First, is
splitting complex sentences into simple clausal
structures made of up syntactic roles.
2. Tagging: Then, tagging biological entities

<bodyText confidence="0.999986555555556">
The novel aspects of our system are its ability to
handle complex sentence structures using the
Complex Sentence Processor (CSP) and to extract
multiple and nested interactions specified in a sen-
tence using the Interaction Extractor without the
labor intensive pattern engineering requirement.
Our approach is based on identification of syntac-
tic roles, such as subject, objects, verb and modifi-
ers, by using the word dependencies. We have used
a dependency based English grammar parser, the
Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley 1993), to
identify the roles. Syntactic roles are utilized to
transform complex sentences into their multiple
clauses each containing a single event. This clausal
structure enables us to engineer an automated algo-
rithm for the extraction of events thus overcoming
the burden of labor intensive pattern engineering
for complex and compound sentences. Pronoun
resolution module assists Interaction Extractor in
identifying interactions spread across multiple sen-
tences using pronominal references. We performed
comparative experimental evaluations with two
state of the art systems. Our experimental results
show that the IntEx system presented here achieves
better performance without the labor intensive rule
engineering step which is required for these state
of the art systems.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2 we survey the related work. In Section 3
we present an architectural overview of the IntEx
system. Sections 4 and 5 explain and illustrate the
individual modules of the IntEx system. A detailed
evaluation of our system with the BioRAT
(Corney, Buxton et al. 2004) and GeneWays
(Rzhetsky, Iossifov et al. 2004) is presented in Sec-
tion 6. Section 7 concludes the paper.

Information extraction is the extraction of salient
facts about pre-specified types of events, entities
(Bunescu, Ge et al. 2003) or relationships from
free text. Information extraction from free-text util-
izes shallow-parsing techniques (Daelemans,
Buchholz et al. 1999), Parts-of-Speech tag-
ging(Brill 1992), noun and verb phrase chunking
(Mikheev and Finch 1997), verb subject and object
relationships (Daelemans, Buchholz et al. 1999),
and learned (Califf and Mooney 1998; Craven and
Kumlein 1999; Seymore, McCallum et al. 1999) or
hand-build patterns to automate the creation of
specialized databases.
Manual pattern engineering approaches employ
shallow parsing with patterns to extract the interac-
tions. In the (Ono, Hishigaki et al. 2001) system,
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999963581818182">
sentences are first tagged using a dictionary based
protein name identifier and then processed by a
module which extracts interactions directly from
complex and compound sentences using regular
expressions based on part of speech tags.
The SUISEKI system of Blaschke (Blaschke,
Andrade et al. 1999) also uses regular expressions,
with probabilities that reflect the experimental ac-
curacy of each pattern to extract interactions into
predefined frame structures.
GENIES (Friedman, Kra et al. 2001) utilizes a
grammar based NLP engine for information extrac-
tion. Recently, it has been extended as GeneWays
(Rzhetsky, Iossifov et al. 2004), which also pro-
vides a Web interface that allows users to search
and submit papers of interest for analysis. The
BioRAT system (Corney, Buxton et al. 2004) uses
manually engineered templates that combine lexi-
cal and semantic information to identify protein
interactions. The GeneScene system(Leroy, Chen
et al. 2003) extracts interactions using frequent
preposition-based templates.
Grammar engineering approaches, on the other
hand use manually generated specialized grammar
rules (Rinaldi, Schneider et al. 2004) that perform
a deep parse of the sentences. Temkin (Temkin and
Gilder 2003) addresses the problem of extracting
protein interactions by using an extendable but
manually built Context Free Grammar (CFG) that
is designed specifically for parsing biological text.
The PathwayAssist system uses an NLP system,
MedScan (Novichkova, Egorov et al. 2003), for the
biomedical domain that tags the entities in text and
produces a semantic tree. Slot filler type rules are
engineered based on the semantic tree representa-
tion to extract relationships from text. Recently,
extraction systems have also used link grammar
(Grinberg, Lafferty et al. 1995) to identify interac-
tions between proteins (Ding, Berleant et al. 2003).
Their approach relies on various linkage paths be-
tween named entities such as gene and protein
names. Such manual pattern engineering ap-
proaches for information extraction are very hard
to scale up to large document collections since they
require labor-intensive and skill-dependent pattern
engineering.
Machine learning approaches have also been used
to learn extraction rules from user tagged training
data. These approaches represent the rules learnt in
various formats such as decision trees (Chiang, Yu
et al. 2004) or grammar rules (Phuong, Lee et al.
2003). Craven et al (Craven and Kumlien 1999)
explored an automatic rule-learning approach that
uses a combination of FOIL (Quinlan 1990) and
Naïve Bayes Classifier to learn extraction rules.

The sentences in English are classified as either
simple, complex, compound or complex-
compound based on the number and types of
clauses present in them. Our extraction system re-
solves the complex, compound and complex-
compound sentence structures (collectively re-
ferred to as complex sentence structures in this
document) into simple sentence clauses which con-
tain a subject and a predicate. These simple sen-
tence clauses are then processed to obtain the
interactions between proteins. The architecture of
the IntEx system is shown in Figure 1, and the fol-
lowing Sections 4 and 5 explain the workings of its
modules.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994865">
4.1 Pronoun Resolution
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942904761905">
Interactions are often specified through pronominal
references to entities in the discourse, or through
co references where, a number of phrases are used
to refer to the same entity. Hence, a complete ap-
proach to extracting information from text should
also take into account the resolution of these refer-
ences. References to entities are generally catego-
rized as co-references or anaphora and has been
investigated using various approaches (Castaiio,
Zhang et al. 2002). IntEx anaphora resolution sub-
system currently focuses on third person pronouns
and reflexives since the first and second person
pronouns are frequently used to refer to the authors
of the papers.
Our pronoun resolution module uses a heuristic
approach to identify the noun phrases referred by
the pronouns in a sentence. The heuristic is based
on the number of the pronoun (singular or plural)
and the proximity of the noun phrase. The first
noun phrase that matches the number of the pro-
noun is considered as the referred phrase.

The tagged sentences need to be pre-processed to

the Link Grammar Parser to produce an incorrect

such elements with alternative formats that is rec-

4.4 Link Grammar and the Link grammar
parser
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999799">
Link grammar (LG) introduced by Sleator and
Temperley (Sleator and Temperley 1991) is a de-
pendency based grammatical system. The basic
idea of link grammar is to connect pairs of words
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.992915">
57
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975615384615">
in a sentence with various syntactically significant
links. The LG consists of set of words, each of
which has various alternative linking requirements.
A linking requirement can be seen as a block with
connectors above each word. A connector is satis-
fied by matching it with compatible connector.
Fig.2 below shows how linking requirements can
be satisfied to produce a parse for the example sen-
tence &amp;quot;The dog chased a cat&amp;quot;.
Even though LG has no explicit notion of constitu-
ents or categories (Sleator and Temperley 1993),
they emerge as contiguous connected sequence of
words attached to the rest of sentence by a particu-
lar types of links, as in the above example where
‘the dog’ and ‘a cat’ are connected to the main
verb via ‘S’ and ‘O’ links respectively. Our algo-
rithms utilize this property of LG where certain
link types allow us to extract the constituents of
sentences irrespective of the tense. The LG
parser’s ability to detect multiple verbs and their
constituent linkage in complex sentences makes it
particularly well suited for our approach during
resolving of complex sentences into their multiple
clauses. The LG parsers’ dictionary can also be
easily enhanced to produce better parses for bio-
medical text (Szolovits 2003).

4.5 Complex Sentence Processor Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.930007428571428">
The complex sentence processor (CSP) component
splitsthe complex sentences into a collection of
simple sentence clauses which contain a subject
and a predicate. The CSP follows a verb-based ap-
proach to extract the simple clauses. A sentence is
identified to be complex it contains more than one
verb. A simple sentence is identified to be one with
a subject, a verb, objects and their modifying
phrases. The example in Figure 3 illustrates the
major steps involved during complex sentence
processing. The following schema is used as the
format to represent simple clauses:
Subject  |Verb  |Object  |Modifying phrase to the
verb

Interaction Extractor (IE) extracts interactions
from simple sentence clauses produced by the
complex sentence processor. The highly technical
terminology and the complex grammatical con-
structs that are present in the biomedical abstracts
make the extraction task difficult, Even a simple
sentence with a single verb can contain multiple
and/or nested interactions. That’s why our IE sys-
tem is based on a deep parse tree structure pre-
sented by the LG and it considers a thorough case
based analysis of contents of various syntactic
roles of the sentences like their subjects (S), verbs
(V), objects (O) and modifying phrases (M) as well
as their linguistically significant and meaningful
combinations like S-V-O, S-O, S-V-M or S-M, il-
lustrated in Figure 4, for finding and extracting
protein-protein interactions.

5.2 Interaction Word Tagger
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999915">
The words that match a biologically significant
action between two gene/protein names are labeled
as ‘interaction words’. Our gazetteer for interaction
words is derived from UMLS and WordNet4. Por-
ter Stemmer (Porter 1997) was also used for stem-
ming such words before matching.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99428">
5.3 Interaction Extractor (IE)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994785714286">
IntEx interaction extractor works as follows. The
input to IE is the preprocessed and typed simple
clause structures. The IE algorithm progresses bot-
tom up, starting from each syntactic role S, V or
M, and expanding them using the lattice provided
in Figure 4 until all ‘Complete’ singleton or com-
posite role types are obtained.
Consider the example shown in Figure 3, for the
third sentence, the boundaries of the subject and
the modifying phrase are identified and both are
role typed as ‘Elementary’ using Table 1. Since the
main verb is tagged as an interaction word, IE uses
the S-V-M composite role from Figure 4 to find
and extract the following complete interaction:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.694259">
{‘The SAC 6 gene Protein’, ‘colocalizes’, ‘actin’}.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999703764705882">
‘Complete’ roles also need to be analyzed in order
to determine their voice as ‘active’ or ‘passive’.
Since there are only a small number of preposition
combinations, such as of-by, from-to etc., that oc-
cur frequently within the clauses, they can be used
to distinguish the agent and the theme of the inter-
actions.
For example, in the sentence “The kinase phos-
phorylation of pRb by c-Abl in the gland could
inhibit ku70”, the subject role is “The kinase phos-
phorylation of pRb by c-Abl in the gland”. Since
the subject has at least two protein names and an
interaction word it is ‘complete’. By using the ‘of-
by’ pattern (...&lt;Interaction-Word (action)&gt;... of
...&lt;theme&gt;...by ...&lt;agent&gt;...) the IE is able to
extract the correct interaction {c-Abl, phosphoryla-
tion, pRb} from the subject role alone.

Blaschke and Valencia (Valencia 2001) recom-
mend DIP (Xenarios, Rice et al. 2000) dataset as a
benchmark for evaluating biomedical Information
Extraction systems. The first evaluation for IntEx
system was performed on the same dataset 5 that
was used for the BioRAT evaluation. For BioRAT
evaluation, authors identified 389 interactions from
the DIP database such that both proteins participat-

interactions correspond to 229 abstracts from the
PubMed. The BioRAT system was evaluated using
these 229 abstracts. The interactions extracted by
the system were then manually examined by a do-
main expert for precision and recall. Precision is a
measure of correctness of the system, and is calcu-
lated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true
positives and false positives. The sensitivity of the
system is given by the recall measure, calculated as
the ratio of true positives to the sum of true posi-

experimental documents and extracted interactions
are available online at our Web site at

We have shown that a syntactic role-based ap-

not as scalable as the automated mechanisms pre-

<abstract confidence="0.996491095238095">In this paper, we present a fully automated extraction system, named IntEx, to identify gene and protein interactions in biomedical text. Our approach is based on first splitting complex sentences into simple clausal structures made up of syntactic roles. Then, tagging biological entities with the help of biomedical and linguistic ontologies. Finally, extracting complete interactions by analyzing the matching contents of syntactic roles and their linguistically significant combinations. Our extraction system handles complex sentences and extracts multiple and nested interactions specified in a sentence. Experimental evaluations with two other state of the art extraction systems indicate that the IntEx system achieves better performance without the labor intensive pattern engineering requirement.</abstract>

Their approach relies on various linkage paths between named entities such as gene and protein names. Such manual pattern engineering approaches for information extraction are very hard to scale up to large document collections since they require labor-intensive and skill-dependent pattern engineering. Machine learning approaches have also been used to learn extraction rules from user tagged training data. These approaches represent the rules learnt in various formats such as decision trees (Chiang, Yu et al. 2004) or grammar rules (Phuong, Lee et al. 2003). Craven et al (Craven and Kumlien 1999) explored an automatic rule-learning approach that uses a combination of FOIL (Quinlan 1990) and Naïve Bayes Classifier to learn extraction rules. 3 System Architecture The sentences in English are classified as either simple, complex, compound or complexcompound based on the number and types of clauses present in them. Our extraction system resolves the complex, compound and complexcompound sentence structures (collectively referred to as complex sentence structures in this document) into simple sentence clauses which contain a subject and a predicate. These simple sentence clauses are then p</context>

Such manual pattern engineering approaches for information extraction are very hard to scale up to large document collections since they require labor-intensive and skill-dependent pattern engineering. Machine learning approaches have also been used to learn extraction rules from user tagged training data. These approaches represent the rules learnt in various formats such as decision trees (Chiang, Yu et al. 2004) or grammar rules (Phuong, Lee et al. 2003). Craven et al (Craven and Kumlien 1999) explored an automatic rule-learning approach that uses a combination of FOIL (Quinlan 1990) and Naïve Bayes Classifier to learn extraction rules. 3 System Architecture The sentences in English are classified as either simple, complex, compound or complexcompound based on the number and types of clauses present in them. Our extraction system resolves the complex, compound and complexcompound sentence structures (collectively referred to as complex sentence structures in this document) into simple sentence clauses which contain a subject and a predicate. These simple sentence clauses are then processed to obtain the interactions between proteins. The architecture of the IntEx system i</context>

This problem is overcome by replacing such elements with alternative formats that is recognizable by the parser. 4.4 Link Grammar and the Link grammar parser Link grammar (LG) introduced by Sleator and Temperley (Sleator and Temperley 1991) is a dependency based grammatical system. The basic idea of link grammar is to connect pairs of words 57 in a sentence with various syntactically significant links. The LG consists of set of words, each of which has various alternative linking requirements. A linking requirement can be seen as a block with connectors above each word. A connector is satisfied by matching it with compatible connector.

The novel aspects of our system are its ability to handle complex sentence structures using the Complex Sentence Processor (CSP) and to extract multiple and nested interactions specified in a sentence using the Interaction Extractor without the labor intensive pattern engineering requirement. Our approach is based on identification of syntactic roles, such as subject, objects, verb and modifiers, by using the word dependencies. We have used a dependency based English grammar parser, the Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley 1993), to identify the roles. Syntactic roles are utilized to transform complex sentences into their multiple clauses each containing a single event. This clausal structure enables us to engineer an automated algorithm for the extraction of events thus overcoming the burden of labor intensive pattern engineering for complex and compound sentences. Pronoun resolution module assists Interaction Extractor in identifying interactions spread across multiple sentences using pronominal references.

The LG parsers’ dictionary can also be easily enhanced to produce better parses for biomedical text (Szolovits 2003). 4.5 Complex Sentence Processor Algorithm The complex sentence processor (CSP) component splitsthe complex sentences into a collection of simple sentence clauses which contain a subject and a predicate. The CSP follows a verb-based approach to extract the simple clauses. A sentence is identified to be complex it contains more than one verb. A simple sentence is identified to be one with a subject, a verb, objects and their modifying phrases. The example in Figure 3 illustrates the major steps involved during complex sentence processing.

The BioRAT system (Corney, Buxton et al. 2004) uses manually engineered templates that combine lexical and semantic information to identify protein interactions. The GeneScene system(Leroy, Chen et al. 2003) extracts interactions using frequent preposition-based templates. Grammar engineering approaches, on the other hand use manually generated specialized grammar rules (Rinaldi, Schneider et al. 2004) that perform a deep parse of the sentences. Temkin (Temkin and Gilder 2003) addresses the problem of extracting protein interactions by using an extendable but manually built Context Free Grammar (CFG) that is designed specifically for parsing biological text. The PathwayAssist system uses an NLP system, MedScan (Novichkova, Egorov et al. 2003), for the biomedical domain that tags the entities in text and produces a semantic tree. Slot filler type rules are engineered based on the semantic tree representation to extract relationships from text.
