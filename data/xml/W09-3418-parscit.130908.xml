Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO-
24613) is the ISO standard which provides
a common standardized framework for the
construction of natural language
processing lexicons. LMF facilitates data
exchange among computational linguistic
resources, and also promises a convenient
uniformity for future application. This
study describes the design and implemen-
tation of the WordNet-LMF used to
represent lexical semantics in Chinese
WordNet. The compiled CWN-LMF will

Princeton WordNet1 is an English lexical data-
base that groups nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs into sets of cognitive synonyms, which
are named as synsets (Fellbaum, 1998; Miller,
1995). The Global WordNet Association
(GWA)2 built on the results of Princeton Word-
Net and Euro WordNet (Vossen, 2004) is a free
and public association that provides a platform to
share and connect all languages in the world. For
Mandarin Chinese in Taiwan, Huang et al. (2004)
constructed the Academia Sinica Bilingual Onto-
logical Wordnet (Sinica BOW) which integrates

lents Database (ECTED) and SUMO for cross-
language linguistic studies. As a follow-up, Chi-
nese WordNet (CWN) has been built as a robust
lexical knowledge system which also embodies a
precise expression of sense relations (Huang et
al., 2008). In recent years, WordNet-like re-
sources have become one of the most reliable
and essential resources for linguistic studies for
all languages (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000; So-
ria et al. 2009; Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004).
Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO-
24613) is the ISO standard which provides a
common standardized framework for the con-
struction of natural language processing lexicons
(Francopoulo et al., 2009). One important pur-
pose of LMF is to define a standard for lexicons
which covers multilingual lexical information
(Francopoulo et al., 2006b). In this study, we
describe the design and implementation of the
Wordnet-LMF (Soria et al. 2009) to represent
lexical semantics in Chinese WordNet.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 introduces Chinese WordNet and Lexi-
cal Markup Framework. Section 3 describes how
we represent Chinese WordNet in the Lexical
Markup Framework (CWN-LMF). Section 4
presents an example on Chinese word sense dis-
tinction using CWN-LMF format. Quantitative
analysis of compiled CWN-LMF is presented in
Section 5. We also describe the application sce-
nario using CWN-LMF for information interope-
rability of lexical semantics in Section 6. Section
7 discusses the experience and difficulties of en-
coding CWN into Wordnet-LMF. Finally, Sec-
tion 8 concludes this study with future research.

<bodyText confidence="0.999958840909091">
Creating a semantic relation-based language re-
source is a time consuming and labor intensive
task, especially for Chinese due to the unobvious
definition and distinction among characters,
morphemes and words. Chinese WordNet 3
(CWN) has been built by Academia Sinica and is
successively extended its scope so far. Lemmas
included in CWN mainly fall on the medium fre-
quency words. Each lexical entry is analyzed
according to the guidelines of Chinese word
sense distinctions (CKIP, 2003; Huang et al.
2003) which contain information including Part-
of-Speech, sense definition, example sentences,
corresponding English synset(s) from Princeton
WordNet, lexical semantic relations and so on.
Unlike Princeton WordNet, CWN has not been
constructed mainly on the synsets and semantic
relations. Rather it focuses to provide precise
expression for the Chinese sense division and the
semantic relations needs to be based on the lin-
guistic theories, especially lexical semantics
(Huang et al., 2008). Moreover, Huang et al.
(2005) designed and implemented the Sinica
Sense Management System (SSMS) to store and
manage word sense data generated in the analy-
sis stage. SSMS is meaning-driven. Each sense
of a lemma is identified specifically using a
unique identifier and given a separate entry.
There are 8,646 lemmas / 25,961 senses until
December 2008 have been analyzed and stored
in SSMS. Figure 1 shows the result of sense dis-
tinction for 足跡 zu-ji ‘footprint’ as an example
in Chinese WordNet.
Huang et al. (2004) proposed Domain Lexico-
Taxonomy (DLT) as a domain taxonomy popu-
lated with lexical entries. By using DLT with
Chinese WordNet and Domain Taxonomy, there
were 15,160 Chinese senses that linked and dis-
tributed in 463 domain nodes. In addition, Huang
et al. (2005) further applied DLT approach to a
Chinese thesaurus called as CiLin and showed
with evaluation that DLT approach is robust
since the size and number of domain lexica in-
creased effectively.

<bodyText confidence="0.9935865">
Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO-24613)
is the ISO standard for natural language
processing lexicons and machine readable dic-
tionaries. The goals of LMF are to provide a
common model for the creation and use of lexi-
cal resources, and to manage the exchange of
data between them. Francopoulo et al. (2006a;
2009) offered a snapshot of how LMF represents
multilingual lexicons. LMF facilitates data ex-
change among computational linguistic resources
and also promises a convenient uniformity for
future application. More updated information can
be found online
at http://www.lexicalmarkupframework.org .
Soria et al. (2009) proposed a Wordnet-LMF
developed in the framework of the KYOTO 4
project as a standardized interoperability format
for the interchange of lexico-semantic informa-
tion. Wordnet-LMF is an LMF dialect tailored to

Wordnet-LMF was designed by adhering to LMF

hand, the peculiarities of the Wordnet model, and
on the other by trying to maximize the efficiency

has three children: one GlobalInformation ele-
ment, one or more Lexicon elements, zero or one
SenseAxes element. This means the object Lexi-
calResource is the container for possibly more
than one lexicon; inter-lingual correspondences
are grouped in SenseAxes section. The details are
presented as follows.

<listItem confidence="0.999229823529412">
• partOfSpeech: It is a required attribute.
This attribute takes as its value the
part-of –speech value that according
to WordNet conventions is usually
specified for a synset. There are four
part-of-speech notations that are used
in CWN-LMF. The notation “n” is
represented as a noun; the notation
“v” is represented as a verb; the nota-
tion “a” is represented as an adjective;
the notation “r” is represented as an
adverb; and the other POS tags are
represented as “s”.

There are nine semantic relations in
Chinese WordNet, including
“has_synonym”, “has_nearsynonym”,
“has_hypernym”, “has_hyponym”,
“has_holonym”, “has_meronym”,

Take nA zi-ran ‘nature’ as an example shown
in Figure 3. nA has six senses (some of them
are abridged in the figure). Id attribute of the first
sense is nA_1 and its synset is called “zho-16-

nA_1 with the unique ID 03059301 in Chinese

noun. Moreover, one can also learn that nA_1
has a synonym, )CnA_1 (zho-16-06653601-n).
Meanwhile, this sense is also corresponded to
IEEE SUMO. Finally, this compiled CWN-LMF

<bodyText confidence="0.99996782">
The EU-7 project, KYOTO (Knowledge Yield-
ing Ontologies for Transition-based Organiza-
tion), wants to make knowledge sharable be-
tween communities of people, culture, language
and computers, by assigning meaning to text and
giving text to meaning (Vossen et al., 2008a;
2008b). The goal of KYOTO is a system that
allows people in communities to define the
meaning of their words and terms in a shared
Wiki platform so that it becomes anchored across
languages and cultures but also so that a comput-
er can use this knowledge to detect knowledge
and facts in text.
KYOTO is a generic system offering know-
ledge transition and information across different
target groups, transgressing linguistic, cultural
and geographic boundaries. Initially developed
for the environmental domain, KYOTO will be
usable in any knowledge domain for mining, or-
ganizing, and distributing information on a glob-
al scale in both European and non-European lan-
guages.
Whereas the current Wikipedia uses free text
to share knowledge, KYOTO will represent this
knowledge so that a computer can understand it.
For example, the notion of environmental foot-
print will become defined in the same way in all
these languages but also in such a way that the
computer knows what information is necessary
to calculate a footprint. With these definitions it
will be possible to find information on footprints
in documents, websites and reports so that users
can directly ask the computer for actual informa-
tion in their environment, for instance, what is
the footprint of their town, their region or their
company.
KYOTO’s principal components are an ontol-
ogy linked to WordNets in seven different lan-
guages (Basque, Chinese, Dutch, English, Italian,
Japanese and Spanish). Due to different natures
of languages, the different designed architectures
were used to develop WordNets in theses lan-
guages. A unified framework is needed for in-
formation exchange. LMF is hence adopted as
the framework at lexical semantic level in this
project. The WordNet in these languages are
compiled with designed WordNet-LMF format.
CWN-LMF will also be involved and benefit for
cross-language interpretabilities in semantic
search field.

7 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998058125">
Due to characters of Chinese language, there are
some difficulties of encoding Chinese WordNet
into Wordnet-LMF. A brief description is pre-
sented as follows.
Chinese WordNet was designed for Chinese
word sense distinction and its lexical semantic
relationships. The designed architecture belongs
to word-driven, not synset-driven. So in CWN-
LMF, we encoded a sense as an individual synset
and marked up the “has_synonym” relation when
senses belong to the same WordNet synset.
In addition, how to define the basic concept of
Chinese language is difficult. So far the basic
word lists of the NEDO project were used as pre-
liminary basis. We need a further method to dis-
tinguish baseConcept attribute of word senses.

8 Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.999994857142857">
This study describes the design and implementa-
tion of how the Wordnet-LMF used to represent
lexical semantics in Chinese WordNet. CWN-
LMF is benefit for data exchange among compu-
tational linguistic resources, and also promises a
convenient uniformity for domain-specific appli-
cations such as KYOTO in cross-language se-
mantic search field.
Future work is investigated with several direc-
tions. We are planning to release Chinese Word-
Net 1.6 using CWN-LMF format in an xml file,
including a XML DTD in the following days. In
addition, the use of this lingual resource for fur-
ther linguistic research is also under investigation.

Chinese WordNet 3 (CWN) has been built by Academia Sinica and is successively extended its scope so far. Lemmas included in CWN mainly fall on the medium frequency words. Each lexical entry is analyzed according to the guidelines of Chinese word sense distinctions (CKIP, 2003; Huang et al. 2003) which contain information including Partof-Speech, sense definition, example sentences, corresponding English synset(s) from Princeton WordNet, lexical semantic relations and so on. Unlike Princeton WordNet, CWN has not been constructed mainly on the synsets and semantic relations. Rather it focuses to provide precise expression for the Chinese sense division and the semantic relations needs to be based on the linguistic theories, especially lexical semantics (Huang et al., 2008).

(2005) designed and implemented the Sinica Sense Management System (SSMS) to store and manage word sense data generated in the analysis stage. SSMS is meaning-driven. Each sense of a lemma is identified specifically using a unique identifier and given a separate entry. There are 8,646 lemmas / 25,961 senses until December 2008 have been analyzed and stored in SSMS. Figure 1 shows the result of sense distinction for 足跡 zu-ji ‘footprint’ as an example in Chinese WordNet. Huang et al. (2004) proposed Domain LexicoTaxonomy (DLT) as a domain taxonomy populated with lexical entries. By using DLT with Chinese WordNet and Domain Taxonomy, there were 15,160 Chinese senses that linked and distributed in 463 domain nodes. In addition, Huang et al.

The goals of LMF are to provide a common model for the creation and use of lexical resources, and to manage the exchange of data between them. Francopoulo et al. (2006a; 2009) offered a snapshot of how LMF represents multilingual lexicons. LMF facilitates data exchange among computational linguistic resources and also promises a convenient uniformity for future application.

This study describes the design and implementation of the WordNet-LMF used to represent lexical semantics in Chinese WordNet. The compiled CWN-LMF will be released to the community for linguistic researches. 1 Introduction Princeton WordNet1 is an English lexical database that groups nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs into sets of cognitive synonyms, which are named as synsets (Fellbaum, 1998; Miller, 1995). The Global WordNet Association (GWA)2 built on the results of Princeton WordNet and Euro WordNet (Vossen, 2004) is a free and public association that provides a platform to share and connect all languages in the world. For Mandarin Chinese in Taiwan, Huang et al. (2004) constructed the Academia Sinica Bilingual Ontological Wordnet (Sinica BOW) which integrates WordNet, English-Chinese Translation Equiva1 Wordnet, available online at http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn 2 Global WordNet Association (GWA), available online at http://www.globalwordnet.org/ lents Database (ECTED) and SUMO for crosslanguage linguistic studies.

The goal of KYOTO is a system that allows people in communities to define the meaning of their words and terms in a shared Wiki platform so that it becomes anchored across languages and cultures but also so that a computer can use this knowledge to detect knowledge and facts in text. KYOTO is a generic system offering knowledge transition and information across different target groups, transgressing linguistic, cultural and geographic boundaries.
