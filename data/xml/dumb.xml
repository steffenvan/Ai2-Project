We present a Hebrew to English transliter-
ation method in the context of a machine
translation system. Our method uses ma-
chine learning to determine which terms
are to be transliterated rather than trans-
lated. The training corpus for this purpose
includes only positive examples, acquired
semi-automatically. Our classifier reduces
more than 38% of the errors made by a
baseline method. The identified terms are
then transliterated. We present an SMT-
based transliteration model trained with a
parallel corpus extracted from Wikipedia
using a fairly simple method which re-
quires minimal knowledge. The correct re-
sult is produced in more than 76% of the
cases, and in 92% of the instances it is one
of the top-5 results. We also demonstrate a
small improvement in the performance of
a Hebrew-to-English MT system that uses
our transliteration module.
