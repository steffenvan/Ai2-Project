We present an experiment to compare a
standard, minimally distinguishing algo-
rithm for the generation of relational refer-
ring expressions with two alternatives that
produce overspecified descriptions. The
experiment shows that discrimination -
which normally plays a major role in the
disambiguation task - is also a major influ-
ence in referential overspecification, even
though disambiguation is in principle not
relevant.

In Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems,
Referring Expression Generation (REG) is the
computational task of providing natural language
descriptions of domain entities (Levelt, 1989; Dale
and Reiter, 1995), as in ‘the second street on the
left’, ‘the money that I found in the kitchen’ etc.
In this paper we will focus on the issue of content
selection of relational descriptions, that is, those
in which the intended target is described via an-
other object, hereby called a landmark. Consider
the example of context in Fig. 1.
</bodyText>

grey except for obj5, which is red.
Let us consider the goal of uniquely identify-
ing the target obj1 in the context in Fig.1. Since
the target shares most atomic properties (e.g., type,
colour and size) with other distractor objects in the
context (and particularly so with respect to obj4),
using a relational property (near-obj2) may help
prevent ambiguity. The following (a)-(c) are ex-
amples of descriptions of this kind produced from
the above context.
(a)The cone near the box
(b)The cone near the grey box
(c)The cone near the small box
As in example (a), existing REG algorithms will
usually pay regard to the Gricean maxim of quan-
tity (Grice, 1975), and avoid the inclusion of prop-
erties that are not strictly required for disambigua-
tion. In the case of relational reference, this means
that both target and landmark portions of the de-
scription may be left underspecified, and unique-
ness will follow from the fact that they mutually
disambiguate each other (Teixeira et al., 2014). In
other words, example (a) may be considered felic-
itous even though both ‘cone’ and ‘box’ are am-
biguous if interpreted independently.
Minimally distinguishing descriptions as in (a)
are the standard output of many REG algorithms
that handle relational descriptions as in (Dale
and Haddock, 1991; Krahmer and Theune, 2002;
Krahmer et al., 2003). Human speakers, on the
other hand, are largely redundant (Engelhardt et
al., 2006; Arts et al., 2011; Koolen et al., 2011;
Engelhardt et al., 2011), and will often produce so-
called overspecified descriptions as in (b-c) above.
In this paper we will focus on the issue of gener-
ating overspecified relational descriptions as in ex-
amples (b-c), discussing which properties should
be selected by a REG algorithm assuming that the
decision to overspecify has already been made.
More specifically, we will discuss whether the al-
gorithm should include colour as in (b), size as in
(c), or other alternatives, and we will assess the
impact of a referential overspecification strategy
that favours highly discriminatory properties over
preferences that are well-established in the liter-
ature. Although this may in principle seem as a
narrow research topic, the generation of relational
descriptions is still subject of considerable debate
in the field (e.g., (Viethen and Dale, 2011) and

2.1 Relational REG
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992906122449">
One of the first REG algorithms to take relations
into account is the work in (Dale and Haddock,
1991), which generates descriptions that may in-
clude relational properties only as a last resort, that
is, only when it is not possible to obtain a uniquely
identifying descriptions by making use of a set of
atomic properties. The algorithm prevents circu-
larity (e.g., ‘the cup on the table that supports a
cup that...’) and avoids the inclusion of redundant
properties with the aid of consistency networks.
As a result, the algorithm favours the generation
of minimally distinguishing relational descriptions
as example (a) in the previous section.
In the Graph algorithm described in (Krahmer et
al., 2003), the referential context is modelled as a
labelled directed graph with vertices representing
domain entities and edges representing properties
that can be either relational (when connecting two
entities) or atomic (when forming self-loops). The
task of obtaining a uniquely identifying descrip-
tion is implemented as a subgraph construction
problem driven by domain-dependent cost func-
tions associated with the decisions made by the al-
gorithm. The work in (Krahmer et al., 2003) does
not make specific assumptions about the actual at-
tribute selection policy, and by varying the cost
functions it is possible to implement a wide range
of referential strategies. The use of the algorithm
for the generation of relational descriptions is dis-
cussed in (Viethen et al., 2013).
The work in (Paraboni et al., 2006) discusses the
issue of ease of search by focussing on the particu-
lar case of relational description in hierarchically-
ordered domains (e.g., books divided into sections
and subsections etc.) Descriptions that may ar-
guably make search difficult, as in ‘the section
that contains a picture’ are prevented by produc-
ing fully-specified descriptions of each individual
object (i.e., picture, section etc.). As in (Dale and
Haddock, 1991), atomic properties are always at-
tempted first, and each target (e.g., a subsection)
holds only one relation (e.g., to its parent section).
Descriptions of this kind are similar to the exam-
ples (b-c) in the previous section. However, hier-
archical structures are highly specialised domains,
and it is less clear to which extent these findings
are applicable to more general situations of ref-
erence as in, e.g., spatial domains (Byron et al.,
2007; dos Santos Silva and Paraboni, 2015).

2.2 Referential overspecification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956409090909">
Assuming that we would like to add a redun-
dant property to overspecify a certain description,
which property should be selected? Research on
REG, cognitive sciences and related fields has in-
vestigated a number of factors that may play a
role in referential overspecification. First of all,
it has been widely observed that some properties
are simply preferred to others. This seems to
be the case, for instance, of the colour attribute.
Colour is ubiquitously found in both redundant
and non-redundant use (Pechmann, 1989), and
empirical evidence suggests that colour is over-
specified more frequently than size (Belke and
Meyer, 2002).
The inherent preference for colour has how-
ever been recently challenged. The work in (van
Gompel et al., 2014), for instance, points out that
when perceptual salience is manipulated so that
a high contrast between target and distractors is
observed, the size attribute may be preferred to
colour. In other words, a highly preferred prop-
erty may not necessarily match the choices made
by human speakers when producing overspecified
descriptions. Results along these lines are also re-
ported in (Tarenskeen et al., 2014).
Redundant and non-redundant uses of colour
(and possibly other preferred properties) may also
be influenced by the difficulty in encoding visual
properties. In (Viethen et al., 2012), for instance,
it is argued that the colour property is more likely
to be selected when it is maximally different from
the other colours in the context. For instance, a red
object is more likely to be described as ‘red’ when
none of the distractors is red, and less so when a
modifier (e.g., ‘light red’) would be required for
disambiguation.
Closer to our present discussion, we notice that
the issue of discrimination as proposed in (Olson,
1970) has been considered by most REG algo-
rithms to date (e.g., (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Krah-
mer and van Deemter, 2012)), and it has even
motivated a number of greedy or minimally dis-
tinguishing REG strategies (Gardent, 2002; Dale,
2002; Areces et al., 2011). Interestingly, the work
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991475">
77
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951368421053">
in (Gatt et al., 2013) has suggested that small dif-
ferences in discriminatory power do not seem to
influence content selection, but large differences
do, a notion that has been applied to the design
of REG algorithms on at least two occasions: in
(de Lucena et al., 2010) properties are selected in
order of preference regardless of their discrimina-
tory power and, if necessary, an additional, highly
discriminatory property is included; in (van Gom-
pel et al., 2012), a fully distinguishing property is
attempted first and, if necessary for disambigua-
tion, further properties are considered based on
both preference and discrimination.
Discrimination clearly plays a major role in the
disambiguation task, but it less clear whether it is
still relevant when disambiguation is not an issue,
that is, in the case of referential overspecification.
The present work is an attempt to shed light on this
particular issue.

Following (Pechmann, 1989) and others, we may
assume that colour should be generally (or perhaps
always) preferred to size. Moreover, as in (Kelle-
her and Kruijff, 2006), we may follow the prin-
ciple of minimal effort (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs,
1986) and assume that atomic properties such as
colour or size should be preferred to relations that
lead to more complex descriptions. In our current
work, however, we will argue that neither needs
to be the case: under the right circumstances, a
wide range of properties - colour, size and even
spatial relations - may be overspecified depend-
ing on their discriminatory power alone. Thus, it
may be the case that size is preferred to colour (un-
like, e.g., (Pechmann, 1989)), and that longer, re-
lational descriptions are preferred to shorter ones
(unlike, e.g., (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006)).
The possible preference for highly discrimina-
tory properties in referential overspecification is
easily illustrated by the examples in the introduc-
tion section. Following (Pechmann, 1989), one
might assume that, if a speaker decides to over-
specify the landmark portion of description (a),
she may add the colour attribute, as in (b). This
strategy, however, turns out to be far less common
in language use if a more discriminatory property
is available, as in the example. More specifically,
the availability of a highly discriminatory land-
mark property (size-small) makes (c) much more
likely than (b). This observation gives rise to the
following research hypothesis:
h1: Given the goal of overspecifying a
relational description by using an ad-
ditional landmark property p, p should
correspond to the most discriminatory
property available in the context.
The idea that speakers may take discriminatory
power into account when referring is of course not
novel. What is less obvious, however, is that dis-
crimination may also play a significant role in sit-
uations that do not involve ambiguity, as in the
above examples. To illustrate this, let us consider
a basic REG algorithm - hereby called Baseline
- consisting of a relational implementation of an
Incremental-like algorithm as proposed in (Dale
and Reiter, 1995).
Given the goal of producing a uniquely identify-
ing description L of a target object r, the Baseline
algorithm works as follows: first, an atomic de-
scription is attempted by examining a list of pre-
ferred attributes P and by selecting those that help
disambiguate the reference, as in the standard In-
cremental approach (Dale and Reiter, 1995). If the
description is uniquely identifying, the algorithm
terminates. If not, a relational property relating r
to a landmark object o is included in L, and the
algorithm is called recursively to describe o using
an atomic description if possible.
Since Baseline terminates as soon as a uniquely
identifying description is obtained, the landmark
description will be usually left underspecified as in
example (a) in Section 1. This behaviour is consis-
tent with existing relational REG algorithms (e.g.,
(Dale and Haddock, 1991; Krahmer et al., 2003)).
Using the Baseline descriptions as a starting
point, however, we may decide to fully-specify the
landmark description (e.g., in order to facilitate
search, as in (Paraboni and van Deemter, 2014))
by selecting an additional property p from the re-
mainder P list, hereby called Po.
There are of course many ways of defining p. In
corpus-based REG, for instance, a plausible strat-
egy would be to assume that the definition of p
is domain-dependent, and simply select the most
frequent (but still discriminatory) property in Po
as seen in training data. We will call this variation
the Most Frequent overspecification strategy.
Choosing the most frequent property p may
lead to descriptions that closely resemble those
observed in the data. However, we predict that
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991359">
78
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999832642857143">
the availability of a highly discriminatory prop-
erty may change this preference. To illustrate this,
we will also consider a Proposal strategy in which
p is taken to be the most discriminatory property
available in Po. In case of a tie, the most fre-
quent property that appears in Po is selected. If
Po does not contain any discriminatory properties,
none will be selected and the landmark descrip-
tion will remain underspecified as in the standard
Baseline approach.
The context in the previous Fig.1 and the ac-
companying examples (a-c) in Section 1 illustrate
the expected output of each of the three algorithms
under consideration. As in previous work on re-
lational REG, the Baseline approach would pro-
duce the minimally distinguishing description (a);
the Most Frequent strategy would overspecify the
landmark portion of the description by adding the
preferred property in the relevant domain (e.g.,
colour) as in (b); and the Proposal strategy would
overspecify by adding the highly discriminatory
property (in this particular example, size) as in (c).
The relation between the three algorithms and
our research hypothesis hl is straightforward. We
would like to show that the predictions made by
Proposal are more accurate than those made by
Baseline and Most Frequent. An experiment to
verify this claim is described in the next section.

For evaluation purposes we will make use the
Stars2 corpus of referring expressions1. Stars2 is
an obvious choice for our experiment since these
data convey visual scenes in which objects will
usually have one highly discriminatory property
available for reference. Moreover, descriptions in
this domain may convey up to two relations (e.g.,
‘the cone next to the ball, near the cone’), which
gives rise to multiple opportunities for referential
overspecification.
In addition to this, we will also make use of the
subset of relational descriptions available from the
GRE3D3 (Dale and Viethen, 2009) and GRE3D7
(Viethen and Dale, 2011) corpora. Situations of
reference in the GRE3D3/7 domain are in many
ways simpler than those in Stars2 (i.e., by con-
taining at most one possible relation in each scene,
by not presenting any property whose discrimina-
tory power is substantially higher than others etc.),
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.979992">
1Some of the corpus features are described in (Ferreira
and Paraboni, 2014)
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937222222222">
but the comparison is still useful since GRE3D3/7
are among the very few annotated relational REG
corpora made publicly available for research pur-
poses, and which have been extensively used in
previous work.
From the three domains - Stars2, GRE3D3 and
GRE3D7 - we selected all instances of relational
descriptions in which the landmark object was de-
scribed by making use of the type attribute and ex-
actly one additional property p. This amounts to
three Reference sets containing 725 descriptions
in total: 367 descriptions from Stars2, 114 from
GRE3D3 and 244 from GRE3D7.
In the situations of reference available from
these domains, the use of p is never necessary for
disambiguation, and p will never be selected by a
standard REG algorithm as the Baseline strategy
described in the previous section. Thus, our goal
is to investigate which overspecification strategy -
Proposal or Most Frequent, cf. previous section -
will select the correct p, and the corresponding im-
pact of this decision on the overall results of each
algorithm.
From the unused portion of each corpus, we es-
timate attribute frequencies to create the prefer-
ence list P required by the algorithms. The fol-
lowing preference orders were obtained:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.94519325">
P(Stars2) =ftype, colour, size, near, in-front-of,

P(GRE3D) =ftype, colour, size, above, in-front-of,

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999483">
In the case of the GRE3D3/7 corpora, we no-
tice that not all attributes appear in both data sets.
Moreover, the attributes hpos and vpos were com-
puted from the existing pos attribute, which was
originally intended to model both horizontal and
vertical screen coordinates as a single property in
(Dale and Viethen, 2009).
Each of the three REG strategies - Baseline,
Proposal and Most Frequent - received as an in-
put the 725 situations of reference represented in
the Reference data and the corresponding P list
for each domain. As a result, three sets of output
descriptions were obtained, hereby called System
sets.
Evaluation was carried out by comparing each
System set to the corresponding Reference cor-
pus descriptions and measuring Dice scores (Dice,
1945) and overall accuracy (that is, the number of
exact matches between each System-Reference de-
scription pair).

Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the eval-
uation of our three algorithms - Baseline, Pro-
posal and Most Frequent - applied to each corpus
- Stars2, GRE3D3 and GRE3D7. Best results are
highlighted in boldface.
Following (Gatt and Belz, 2007) and many
others, we compare Dice scores obtained by the
three algorithms applied to the generation of
the selected descriptions of each domain using
Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test. In the Overall evalua-
tion, Proposal outperforms both alternatives. The
difference is significant (W(338)=-34327, Z=-
9.55, p &lt; 0.0001). Highly discriminatory proper-
ties are indeed those that are normally selected by
human speakers when they decide to overspecify a
landmark description. This supports our research
hypothesis h1.
Individual results are as follows. In the
case of the Stars2 domain, Proposal outperforms
both alternatives. The difference is significant
(W(241)=-26639, Z=-12.29, p &lt; 0.0001). In
the case of GRE3D3, once again Proposal out-
performs the alternatives. The difference is also
significant (W(27)=-248, Z=-2.97, p &lt; 0.03). Fi-
nally, in the case of GRE3D7, an effect in the op-
position direction was observed, i.e., the Most Fre-
quent algorithm outperforms the alternatives. The
difference is significant (W(70)=1477, Z=4.32,
p &lt; 0.0001).
The differences across domains are explained
by the proportion of highly discriminatory land-
mark properties in each corpus. In Stars2, the
nearest landmark has at least one highly discrim-
inatory property in all scenes involving relational
reference. In GRE3D3, the nearest landmark has
a highly discriminatory property in 80% of the
scenes, and in GRE3D7 this is the case in only
50% of the scenes. Thus, given the opportu-
nity, the use of a highly discriminatory property
seems to be preferred. The absence of a prop-
erty that ‘stands out’, by contrast, appears to make
the choice among them a matter of preference, an
observation that is consistent with the findings in
(Gatt et al., 2013).

This paper has presented a practical REG experi-
ment to illustrate the impact of discrimination on
the generation of overspecified relational descrip-
tions. The experiment shows that discrimination -
which normally plays a major role in the disam-
biguation task - is also a considerable influence
in referential overspecification, that is, even when
discrimination is in principle not an issue. Our
findings correlate with previous empirical work in
the field, and show that discrimination may effec-
tively trump the inherent preference for absolute
properties and for those that are easier to realise
in surface form. For instance, contrary to (Pech-
mann, 1989) and many others, speakers would
generally prefer referring to size as in (b), despite
evidence suggesting that colour is overspecified
more frequently than size. Moreover, contrary to
(Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006), speakers would also
prefer referring to a spatial relation as in (c) even
though the resulting descriptions turns out to be
more complex.
We are aware that the present work has focussed
on extreme situations in which a highly discrimi-
natory property is available for overspecification.
As future work, it is necessary to further this inves-
tigation by taking into account various degrees of
discrimination. As suggested in (Gatt et al., 2013),
the effect of discrimination may be perceived as a
continuum, and in that case a practical REG algo-
rithm should be able to make more complex deci-
sions that those presently implemented.

Research on REG, cognitive sciences and related fields has investigated a number of factors that may play a role in referential overspecification. First of all, it has been widely observed that some properties are simply preferred to others. This seems to be the case, for instance, of the colour attribute. Colour is ubiquitously found in both redundant and non-redundant use (Pechmann, 1989), and empirical evidence suggests that colour is overspecified more frequently than size (Belke and Meyer, 2002). The inherent preference for colour has however been recently challenged. The work in (van Gompel et al., 2014), for instance, points out that when perceptual salience is manipulated so that a high contrast between target and distractors is observed, the size attribute may be preferred to colour. In other words, a highly preferred property may not necessarily match the choices made by human speakers when producing overspecified descriptions. Results along these lines are also reported in (Tarenskeen et al., 2014). Redundant and non-redundant uses of colour (and possibly other preferred proper</context>

Discrimination clearly plays a major role in the disambiguation task, but it less clear whether it is still relevant when disambiguation is not an issue, that is, in the case of referential overspecification. The present work is an attempt to shed light on this particular issue. 3 Current work Following (Pechmann, 1989) and others, we may assume that colour should be generally (or perhaps always) preferred to size. Moreover, as in (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006), we may follow the principle of minimal effort (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986) and assume that atomic properties such as colour or size should be preferred to relations that lead to more complex descriptions. In our current work, however, we will argue that neither needs to be the case: under the right circumstances, a wide range of properties - colour, size and even spatial relations - may be overspecified depending on their discriminatory power alone. Thus, it may be the case that size is preferred to colour (unlike, e.g., (Pechmann, 1989)), and that longer, relational descriptions are preferred to shorter ones (unlike, e.g., (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006)).

The algorithm prevents circularity (e.g., ‘the cup on the table that supports a cup that...’) and avoids the inclusion of redundant properties with the aid of consistency networks. As a result, the algorithm favours the generation of minimally distinguishing relational descriptions as example (a) in the previous section.

The use of the algorithm for the generation of relational descriptions is discussed in (Viethen et al., 2013). The work in (Paraboni et al., 2006) discusses the issue of ease of search by focussing on the particular case of relational description in hierarchicallyordered domains (e.g., books divided into sections and subsections etc.) Descriptions that may arguably make search difficult, as in ‘the section that contains a picture’ are prevented by producing fully-specified descriptions of each individual object (i.e., picture, section etc.). As in (Dale and Haddock, 1991), atomic properties are always attempted first, and each target (e.g., a subsection) holds only one relation (e.g., to its parent section).

If the description is uniquely identifying, the algorithm terminates. If not, a relational property relating r to a landmark object o is included in L, and the algorithm is called recursively to describe o using an atomic description if possible. Since Baseline terminates as soon as a uniquely identifying description is obtained, the landmark description will be usually left underspecified as in example (a) in Section 1. This behaviour is consistent with existing relational REG algorithms (e.g., (Dale and Haddock, 1991; Krahmer et al., 2003)). Using the Baseline descriptions as a starting point, however, we may decide to fully-specify the landmark description (e.g., in order to facilitate search, as in (Paraboni and van Deemter, 2014)) by selecting an additional property p from the remainder P list, hereby called Po. There are of course many ways of defining p. In corpus-based REG, for instance, a plausible strategy would be to assume that the definition of p is domain-dependent, and simply select the most frequent (but still discriminatory) property in Po as seen in training data.

The experiment shows that discrimination - which normally plays a major role in the disambiguation task - is also a major influence in referential overspecification, even though disambiguation is in principle not relevant. 1 Introduction In Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, Referring Expression Generation (REG) is the computational task of providing natural language descriptions of domain entities (Levelt, 1989; Dale and Reiter, 1995), as in ‘the second street on the left’, ‘the money that I found in the kitchen’ etc. In this paper we will focus on the issue of content selection of relational descriptions, that is, those in which the intended target is described via another object, hereby called a landmark. Consider the example of context in Fig. 1. Figure 1: A simple visual context. All objects are grey except for obj5, which is red. Let us consider the goal of uniquely identifying the target obj1 in the context in Fig.1. Since the target shares most atomic properties (e.g., type, colour and size) with other distractor ob</context>

In (Viethen et al., 2012), for instance, it is argued that the colour property is more likely to be selected when it is maximally different from the other colours in the context. For instance, a red object is more likely to be described as ‘red’ when none of the distractors is red, and less so when a modifier (e.g., ‘light red’) would be required for disambiguation. Closer to our present discussion, we notice that the issue of discrimination as proposed in (Olson, 1970) has been considered by most REG algorithms to date (e.g., (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Krahmer and van Deemter, 2012)), and it has even motivated a number of greedy or minimally distinguishing REG strategies (Gardent, 2002; Dale, 2002; Areces et al., 2011). Interestingly, the work 77 in (Gatt et al., 2013) has suggested that small differences in discriminatory power do not seem to influence content selection, but large differences do, a notion that has been applied to the design of REG algorithms on at least two occasions: in (de Lucena et al., 2010) properties are selected in order of preference regardless of their discriminatory power and, if necessary, an additional, highly</context>

The idea that speakers may take discriminatory power into account when referring is of course not novel. What is less obvious, however, is that discrimination may also play a significant role in situations that do not involve ambiguity, as in the above examples. To illustrate this, let us consider a basic REG algorithm - hereby called Baseline - consisting of a relational implementation of an Incremental-like algorithm as proposed in (Dale and Reiter, 1995). Given the goal of producing a uniquely identifying description L of a target object r, the Baseline algorithm works as follows: first, an atomic description is attempted by examining a list of preferred attributes P and by selecting those that help disambiguate the reference, as in the standard Incremental approach (Dale and Reiter, 1995). If the description is uniquely identifying, the algorithm terminates. If not, a relational property relating r to a landmark object o is included in L, and the algorithm is called recursively to describe o using an atomic description if possible. Since Bas</context>

Stars2 is an obvious choice for our experiment since these data convey visual scenes in which objects will usually have one highly discriminatory property available for reference. Moreover, descriptions in this domain may convey up to two relations (e.g., ‘the cone next to the ball, near the cone’), which gives rise to multiple opportunities for referential overspecification. In addition to this, we will also make use of the subset of relational descriptions available from the GRE3D3 (Dale and Viethen, 2009) and GRE3D7 (Viethen and Dale, 2011) corpora. Situations of reference in the GRE3D3/7 domain are in many ways simpler than those in Stars2 (i.e., by containing at most one possible relation in each scene, by not presenting any property whose discriminatory power is substantially higher than others etc.), 1Some of the corpus features are described in (Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014) but the comparison is still useful since GRE3D3/7 are among the very few annotated relational REG corpora made publicly available for research purposes, and which have been extensively used in previous work.

Moreover, the attributes hpos and vpos were computed from the existing pos attribute, which was originally intended to model both horizontal and vertical screen coordinates as a single property in (Dale and Viethen, 2009). Each of the three REG strategies - Baseline, Proposal and Most Frequent - received as an input the 725 situations of reference represented in the Reference data and the corresponding P list for each domain. As a result, three sets of output descriptions were obtained, hereby called System sets. Evaluation was carried out by comparing each System set to the corresponding Reference corpus descriptions and measuring Dice scores (Dice, 1945) and overall accuracy (that is, the number of exact matches between each System-Reference description pair). 79 Table 1: Results Algorithm Baseline Most freq</context>

As in (Dale and Haddock, 1991), atomic properties are always attempted first, and each target (e.g., a subsection) holds only one relation (e.g., to its parent section). Descriptions of this kind are similar to the examples (b-c) in the previous section. However, hierarchical structures are highly specialised domains, and it is less clear to which extent these findings are applicable to more general situations of reference as in, e.g., spatial domains (Byron et al., 2007; dos Santos Silva and Paraboni, 2015). 2.2 Referential overspecification Assuming that we would like to add a redundant property to overspecify a certain description, which property should be selected? Research on REG, cognitive sciences and related fields has investigated a number of factors that may play a role in referential overspecification. First of all, it has been widely observed that some properties are simply preferred to others. This seems to be the case, for instance, of the colour attribute. Colour is ubiquitously found in both redundant and non-redundant use (Pechmann, 1989), and empirical evidence suggests that col</context>

Situations of reference in the GRE3D3/7 domain are in many ways simpler than those in Stars2 (i.e., by containing at most one possible relation in each scene, by not presenting any property whose discriminatory power is substantially higher than others etc.), 1Some of the corpus features are described in (Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014) but the comparison is still useful since GRE3D3/7 are among the very few annotated relational REG corpora made publicly available for research purposes, and which have been extensively used in previous work. From the three domains - Stars2, GRE3D3 and GRE3D7 - we selected all instances of relational descriptions in which the landmark object was described by making use of the type attribute and exactly one additional property p.

For instance, a red object is more likely to be described as ‘red’ when none of the distractors is red, and less so when a modifier (e.g., ‘light red’) would be required for disambiguation. Closer to our present discussion, we notice that the issue of discrimination as proposed in (Olson, 1970) has been considered by most REG algorithms to date (e.g., (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Krahmer and van Deemter, 2012)), and it has even motivated a number of greedy or minimally distinguishing REG strategies (Gardent, 2002; Dale, 2002; Areces et al., 2011). Interestingly, the work 77 in (Gatt et al., 2013) has suggested that small differences in discriminatory power do not seem to influence content selection, but large differences do, a notion that has been applied to the design of REG algorithms on at least two occasions: in (de Lucena et al., 2010) properties are selected in order of preference regardless of their discriminatory power and, if necessary, an additional, highly discriminatory property is included; in (van Gompel et al., 2012), a fully distinguishing property is attempted first and, if necessary </context>

Discrimination clearly plays a major role in the disambiguation task, but it less clear whether it is still relevant when disambiguation is not an issue, that is, in the case of referential overspecification. The present work is an attempt to shed light on this particular issue. 3 Current work Following (Pechmann, 1989) and others, we may assume that colour should be generally (or perhaps always) preferred to size. Moreover, as in (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006), we may follow the principle of minimal effort (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986) and assume that atomic properties such as colour or size should be preferred to relations that lead to more complex descriptions. In our current work, however, we will argue that neither needs to be the case: under the right circumstances, a wide range of properties - colour, size and even spatial relations - may be overspecified depending on their discriminatory power alone. Thus, it may be the case that size is preferred to colour (unlike, e.g., (Pechmann, 1989)), and that longer, relational descriptions are prefe</context>

Our findings correlate with previous empirical work in the field, and show that discrimination may effectively trump the inherent preference for absolute properties and for those that are easier to realise in surface form. For instance, contrary to (Pechmann, 1989) and many others, speakers would generally prefer referring to size as in (b), despite evidence suggesting that colour is overspecified more frequently than size. Moreover, contrary to (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006), speakers would also prefer referring to a spatial relation as in (c) even though the resulting descriptions turns out to be more complex. We are aware that the present work has focussed on extreme situations in which a highly discriminatory property is available for overspecification. As future work, it is necessary to further this investigation by taking into account various degrees of discrimination. As suggested in (Gatt et al., 2013), the effect of discrimination may be perceived as a continuum, and in that case a practical REG algorithm should be able to make more complex decisions that</context>

The experiment shows that discrimination - which normally plays a major role in the disambiguation task - is also a major influence in referential overspecification, even though disambiguation is in principle not relevant. 1 Introduction In Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, Referring Expression Generation (REG) is the computational task of providing natural language descriptions of domain entities (Levelt, 1989; Dale and Reiter, 1995), as in ‘the second street on the left’, ‘the money that I found in the kitchen’ etc. In this paper we will focus on the issue of content selection of relational descriptions, that is, those in which the intended target is described via another object, hereby called a landmark. Consider the example of context in Fig. 1. Figure 1: A simple visual context. All objects are grey except for obj5, which is red. Let us consider the goal of uniquely identifying the target obj1 in the context in Fig.1. Since the target shares most atomic properties (e.g., type, colour and size) </context>

In (Viethen et al., 2012), for instance, it is argued that the colour property is more likely to be selected when it is maximally different from the other colours in the context. For instance, a red object is more likely to be described as ‘red’ when none of the distractors is red, and less so when a modifier (e.g., ‘light red’) would be required for disambiguation. Closer to our present discussion, we notice that the issue of discrimination as proposed in (Olson, 1970) has been considered by most REG algorithms to date (e.g., (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Krahmer and van Deemter, 2012)), and it has even motivated a number of greedy or minimally distinguishing REG strategies (Gardent, 2002; Dale, 2002; Areces et al., 2011). Interestingly, the work 77 in (Gatt et al., 2013) has suggested that small differences in discriminatory power do not seem to influence content selection, but large differences do, a notion that has been applied to the design of REG algorithms on at least two occasions: in (de Lucena et al., 2010) properties are selected in order of preference </context>

Research on REG, cognitive sciences and related fields has investigated a number of factors that may play a role in referential overspecification. First of all, it has been widely observed that some properties are simply preferred to others. This seems to be the case, for instance, of the colour attribute. Colour is ubiquitously found in both redundant and non-redundant use (Pechmann, 1989), and empirical evidence suggests that colour is overspecified more frequently than size (Belke and Meyer, 2002). The inherent preference for colour has however been recently challenged. The work in (van Gompel et al., 2014), for instance, points out that when perceptual salience is manipulated so that a high contrast between target and distractors is observed, the size attribute may be preferred to colour. In other words, a highly preferred property may not necessarily match the choices made by human speakers when producing overspecified descriptions. Results along these lines are also report</context>

Discrimination clearly plays a major role in the disambiguation task, but it less clear whether it is still relevant when disambiguation is not an issue, that is, in the case of referential overspecification. The present work is an attempt to shed light on this particular issue. 3 Current work Following (Pechmann, 1989) and others, we may assume that colour should be generally (or perhaps always) preferred to size. Moreover, as in (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006), we may follow the principle of minimal effort (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986) and assume that atomic properties such as colour or size should be preferred to relations that lead to more complex descriptions. In our current work, however, we will argue that neither needs to be the case: under the right circumstances, a wide range of properties - colour, size and even spatial relations - may be overspecified depending on their discriminatory power alone. </context>

The experiment shows that discrimination - which normally plays a major role in the disambiguation task - is also a considerable influence in referential overspecification, that is, even when discrimination is in principle not an issue. Our findings correlate with previous empirical work in the field, and show that discrimination may effectively trump the inherent preference for absolute properties and for those that are easier to realise in surface form. For instance, contrary to (Pechmann, 1989) and many others, speakers would generally prefer referring to size as in (b), despite evidence suggesting that colour is overspecified more frequently than size. Moreover, contrary to (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006), speakers would also prefer referring to a spatial relation as in (c) even though the resulting descriptions turns out to be more complex. We are aware that the present work has focussed on extreme situations in which a highly discriminatory property is available for overspecification. As future work, it is necessary to further this investigation by taking into account various degree</context>

(a)The cone near the box (b)The cone near the grey box (c)The cone near the small box As in example (a), existing REG algorithms will usually pay regard to the Gricean maxim of quantity (Grice, 1975), and avoid the inclusion of properties that are not strictly required for disambiguation. In the case of relational reference, this means that both target and landmark portions of the description may be left underspecified, and uniqueness will follow from the fact that they mutually disambiguate each other (Teixeira et al., 2014). In other words, example (a) may be considered felicitous even though both ‘cone’ and ‘box’ are ambiguous if interpreted independently. Minimally distinguishing descriptions as in (a) are the standard output of many REG algorithms that handle relational descriptions as in (Dale and Haddock, 1991; Krahmer and Theune, 2002; Krahmer et al., 2003). Human speakers, on the other hand, are largely redundant (Engelhardt et al., 2006; Arts et al., 2011; Koolen et al., 2011; Engelhardt et al., 2011), and will often produce socalled overspecified descriptions as in (b-c) above.

More specifically, we will discuss whether the algorithm should include colour as in (b), size as in (c), or other alternatives, and we will assess the impact of a referential overspecification strategy that favours highly discriminatory properties over preferences that are well-established in the literature. Although this may in principle seem as a narrow research topic, the generation of relational descriptions is still subject of considerable debate in the field (e.g., (Viethen and Dale, 2011) and 76 Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Short Papers), pages 76–82, Beijing, China, July 26-31, 2015. c�2015 Association for Computational Linguistics the issue of landmark under/full-specification has a number of known consequences for referential identification (e.g., (Paraboni and van Deemter, 2014)). 2 Related work 2.1 Relational REG One of the first REG algorithms to take relations into account is the work in (Dale and Haddock, 1991), which generates descripti</context>

Stars2 is an obvious choice for our experiment since these data convey visual scenes in which objects will usually have one highly discriminatory property available for reference. Moreover, descriptions in this domain may convey up to two relations (e.g., ‘the cone next to the ball, near the cone’), which gives rise to multiple opportunities for referential overspecification. In addition to this, we will also make use of the subset of relational descriptions available from the GRE3D3 (Dale and Viethen, 2009) and GRE3D7 (Viethen and Dale, 2011) corpora. Situations of reference in the GRE3D3/7 domain are in many ways simpler than those in Stars2 (i.e., by containing at most one possible relation in each scene, by not presenting any property whose discriminatory power is substantially higher than others etc.), 1Some of the corpus features are described in (Ferreira and Paraboni, 2014) but the comparison is still useful since GRE3D3/7 are among the very few annotated relational REG corpora made publicly available for research purposes, and which have been extensively used in previous work.

The task of obtaining a uniquely identifying description is implemented as a subgraph construction problem driven by domain-dependent cost functions associated with the decisions made by the algorithm. The work in (Krahmer et al., 2003) does not make specific assumptions about the actual attribute selection policy, and by varying the cost functions it is possible to implement a wide range of referential strategies. The use of the algorithm for the generation of relational descriptions is discussed in (Viethen et al., 2013). The work in (Paraboni et al., 2006) discusses the issue of ease of search by focussing on the particular case of relational description in hierarchicallyordered domains (e.g., books divided into sections and subsections etc.) Descriptions that may arguably make search difficult, as in ‘the section that contains a picture’ are prevented by producing fully-specified descriptions of each individual object (i.e., picture, section etc.). As in (Dale and Haddock, 1991), atomic properties are always attempted first, and each target (e.g., a subsection) holds only one relation (e.g., to its parent s</context>
