Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.996979090909091">
We describe and motivate the design of a
lexico-grammatical knowledgebase called
StringNet and illustrate its significance for re-
search into constructional phenomena in Eng-
lish. StringNet consists of a massive archive
of what we call hybrid n-grams. Unlike tradi-
tional n-grams, hybrid n-grams can consist of
any co-occurring combination of POS tags,
lexemes, and specific word forms. Further, we
detect and represent superordinate and subor-
dinate relations among hybrid n-grams by
cross-indexing, allowing the navigation of
StringNet through these hierarchies, from spe-
cific fixed expressions (“It’s the thought that
counts”) up to their hosting proto-
constructions (e.g. the It Cleft construction:
“it’s the [noun] that [verb]”). StringNet sup-
ports discovery of grammatical dependencies
(e.g., subject-verb agreement) in non-
canonical configurations as well as lexical de-
pendencies (e.g., adjective/noun collocations
specific to families of constructions).

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912509090909">
Constructions have posed persistent challenges to
the field of computational linguistics (Baldwin et
al 2004; Sag et al 2002; Zhang et al 2006). Chal-
lenges to both statistical and symbolic approaches
arise, for example, from the meager degree of pro-
ductivity and non-canonical structures of many
constructions and, as a loosely defined family of
linguistic phenomena, their varied mix of regular-
ity and idiomicity (Fillmore, Kay, and O’Connor
1988). It has been argued for decades that con-
structions are central rather than peripheral to any
adequate account of linguistic knowledge and that
they pose substantial challenges to mainstream
accounts of language (Bolinger, 1977, 1985; Fill-
more, Kay, and O’Connor, 1988; Goldberg, 1995;
inter alia). But the recent attention they have been
receiving in computational research is perhaps due
more to their status as troublemakers (or a “pain in
the neck”, Sag et al 2002). Baldwin et al (2004)
found, for example, that 39% of parse failures on
clean data (BNC) occurred on constructions. (See
Zhang et al (2006) for other such findings.) Thus,
it is becoming urgent to “deal with” constructions
for the sake of NLP. In this paper, however, we
would like to shift perspective a bit to explore in-
stead the application of computational resources
for the sake of constructions. Our longer term aim
is to broaden and deepen research on constructions
in order to support the learning and teaching of
constructions in second language education. Two
basic challenges we address are: (1) the varied mix
of regularity and idiomicity to be found within the
wide range of constructions in a language (Fill-
more, Kay, and O’Connor, 1988; Jackendoff, 2008
inter alia), and (2) the inheritance-like hierarchical
relations holding between and among different
constructions as instances of more general con-
structions or proto-constructions subsuming other
constructions as sub-cases (Goldberg 1995 inter
alia). To address these, we introduce a lexico-
grammatical knowledgebase called StringNet and
describe some ways that it can support the investi-
gation of constructions.
Within the broad range of definitions for con-
structions, one widely shared premise is that the
traditional division between lexical knowledge on
the one hand and grammatical rules on the other is
an artificial one. There are huge tracts of linguistic
territory lying between the lexical and the gram-
matical which usage-attuned linguists have seen as
not simply a residue of undiscovered deeper gen-
eral principles but as the actual lay of the linguistic
land (Bolinger 1977). We have taken this lexico-
grammatical territory as a core target of the work
we report here. StringNet has been designed to

2 Background and Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988933971014493">
The specific approach we take to designing
StringNet is motivated by the varied mixture of
idiomicity and regularity exhibited by construc-
tions mentioned above and the problems this poses
both for symbolic and statistical approaches in
computational linguistics. To frame the properties
of constructions that we hope StringNet can help
address, we make use of Fillmore, Kay, and
O’Connor’s distinction between substantive and
formal idioms (1988), the latter of which they
categorize eventually under “grammatical con-
structions” (p. 506). Substantive (or “lexically
filled”) idioms are those fixed at the lexical level,
that is, lexical strings relatively frozen except per-
haps for inflectional variation. Among examples
they site are pull a fast one, all of a sudden, kick
the bucket. Others, extracted by StringNet, would
include as a matter of fact, at a moment’s notice,
just to be on the safe side, and a massive inventory
of other fixed strings. In contrast to substantive
idioms, formal (or “lexically open”) idioms “...are
syntactic patterns dedicated to semantic and prag-
matic purposes not knowable from their form
alone” (p. 505) These would include such expres-
sions detected with StringNet as “bring [pnp1] to
[dps] senses,” “stop [pnp] in [dps] tracks,” “It is
safe to [verb] that” (e.g., It is safe to as-
sume/say/predict that),” “There is a tendency for
[noun] to [verb],” “[verb][dps] socks off” (e.g.,
knock your socks off). As mentioned above, on
Fillmore et al’s analysis, it is the latter type, the
formal idioms, which are eventually “absorbed into
the category of grammatical constructions” (p.
506). Crucially for us, however, they point out the
potential significance of substantive (lexically

from CLAWS 5 tagset is are follows: pnp = pronoun, dps =
possessive determiner, nn1 = singular noun, nn2 = plural noun,

filled) idioms for construction research. A substan-
tive or frozen idiom may be a sub-case of a formal
or lexically open idiom. Our example of this is the
lexically filled idiom “It’s the thought that counts”
with its idiosyncratic interpretation that must be
learned as a listeme; it presupposes something sub-
standard about a gift or an effort as well as for-
giveness of this in light of the good intentions of
the giver. Yet much of its meaning derives from its
status as an instance of the more general “It cleft”
construction; the focus slot hosts one member of a
contrasting pair or set, and that member is assumed
to be new information, etc.).
Considering the challenges of extracting and
representing these two sorts of expressions, sub-
stantive idioms have been the far more tractable of
the two. Specifically, substantive, lexically filled
idioms are readily susceptible to detection and rep-
resentation by traditional n-grams. It is formal
(lexically open) idioms, however, which have been
identified more closely with constructions, yet they
have proven much more resistant to extraction by
computational means; for example, approaches
using n-grams have so far shown little progress in
handling this category of expression. And parsers
famously have difficulties with their non-canonical
structures (Baldwin et al 2004; Zhang et al 2006;
inter alia).
The design of StringNet is aimed at addressing
three long-recognized qualities of constructions:

by traditional n-grams; and (3) the hierarchical re-
lations holding among them, as, for example, “it’s
the thought that counts” instantiates the general It
Cleft construction while each arguably warrants
independent status as a construction.

3.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996353625">
In this section we describe the design of StringNet.
In light of the well-documented problems that con-
structions pose for parsers, we eschew parsing at
this stage to see what we can achieve without it
first.2 StringNet is a corpus-derived knowledge-

parsing could play a well-motivated role, but we leave that for
future work.

base, automatically extracted from the British Na-
tional Corpus (BNC). The structure of StringNet
can be described in two parts: (1) a special type of
n-grams that we refer to as hybrid n-grams, consti-
tuting the core content of StringNet and (2) the
inter-relations among these hybrid n-grams, repre-
sented by cross-indexing. We describe and moti-
vate these two aspects in turn.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99944">
3.2 Hybrid n-grams
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922081632653">
Unlike traditional n-grams, hybrid n-grams can
consist of co-occurring grams from different levels
of analysis, more specifically, a combination of
lexemes, word forms, and parts of speech (POSs)
potentially side by side within the same string. For
example, “from my point of view” is a traditional
n-gram attested in BNC, where the grams are all
lexical. However, our hybrid n-gram extraction, in
addition, detects the substitutability of the second
slot in this string and indicates this substitutability
by a POS in that position: “from [dps] point of
view”. By including POS categories, hybrid n-
grams can encode the paradigmatic dimension in
addition to the syntagmatic one represented by tra-
ditional n-grams.
The hybrid n-grams that constitute StringNet’s
content are derived from BNC. Specifically, we
include any contiguous combination of gram types
ranging from bi-grams to 8-grams. Two criteria
must be met for each hybrid n-gram. (1) It must
include at least one lexical gram in the string (that
is, either a lexeme or a specific word form). This
means that all of the hybrid n-grams are “lexically
anchored” to some extent. And (2) it must be at-
tested in BNC at a minimum frequency of five to-
kens.
There are four categories of grams that can oc-
cur in the hybrid n-grams of StringNet. From spe-
cific to general, these categories are: (1) word form
(thus, ran, run, and running are three distinct word
forms); (2) lexeme (run, including all its different
inflectional forms: run, ran, running); these are
indicated in bold to distinguish them from word
forms; (3) detailed POS category, taken from the
large CLAWS set of 46 tags ([nn1] for singular
noun); these are marked off in brackets; (4) rough
POS category, taken from abbreviated tagset of 12
POS tags ([noun], including plural and singular
nouns); indicated with brackets as well to avoid
flooding users with too many distinctions in the
representations. Further, each hybrid n-gram is
indexed to all tokens instantiating it in BNC. Thus,
every token of “saw the light” occurring in BNC is
indexed to all hybrid n-grams that it satisfies, for
example, indexed to “[verb] the light”, “see [det]
light”, “[verb] [det] light”, “saw the [noun]”, and
so on. As mentioned above, only hybrid n-grams
attested by at least five tokens occurring in BNC
are kept in StringNet.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990206">
3.3 Structure of StringNet: Cross-indexing of
Hybrid n-grams
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996675">
Since the inventory of gram types consists of four
categories and these can stand in subordinate and
superordinate relation to each other, it becomes
possible to find relations of inclusion or subsump-
tion between hybrid n-grams. For the sake of sim-
plicity in the user interface, we label these as
parent/child relations.
Take the tri-gram “paying attention to” as an ex-
ample. As a string of word forms, this hybrid n-
gram can be considered a child of the hybrid n-
grams: pay attention to (where pay indicates the
lexeme and includes forms pay, paid, paying).
Non-monotonically, then, “paying attention to” can
(and does) have more than one parent, for exam-
ple: pay [noun] to; pay attention [prep]; among
several others. StringNet exhaustively cross-
indexes all of these thus-related hybrid n-grams.
(Note that hybrid n-grams can have more compli-
cated relations with each other, but these are not
indexed in the current StringNet.) As a massive
inventory of hybrid n-grams and the cross-indexing
among them, StringNet is very large. For compari-
son, the size of our POS-tagged BNC is 4.4 GB.
StringNet, which we extracted from BNC, is over a
terabyte (over 1,000 GB), about 250 times the size
of BNC.
The hybrid n-grams making up StringNet were
extracted from BNC on the simple criterion of fre-
quency (minimum frequency of 5 tokens in BNC),
making no use of statistical techniques such as
word association measures in the extraction proc-
ess. However, to support queries of StringNet we
must have some criteria for ranking the hybrid n-
grams returned in a query result. For this, we use
MI as our default hybrid n-gram association meas-
urement. The MI equation is as follows:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.924377">
27
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.994773027027027">
,where
This equation is well-known as an association
measure for collocations consisting of word pairs.
However it is not appropriate directly used in
measuring hybrid n-grams or n-grams in Lex-
Checker because it cannot compare n-grams of
different length, i.e with different values of n. It
would typically be biased toward longer n-grams.
Therefore we use a version which normalizes, as
follows:
,where hn is the target hybrid n-gram, q is user
query, MI( ) is the traditional MI equation men-
tioned above and maxMIn is the maximum MI
score achieved among all of the n-grams of any
given length n and retrieved for query q.
For example, a hybrid tri-gram T=“pay attention
to” and a hybrid 4-gram Q=“pay attention to the”
will be shown in the results of the query
q=“attention”. Assume MI(T)=5, MI(Q)=7, max-
MI3 (“attention”) =15 and maxMI4 (“attention”) =
20. Then the Normalized MI(T,q) = 5/15 = 0.334
and Normalized MI(Q,q) = 7/20 = 0.35. So we can
rank Q higher than T. MI(hn) will never be greater
than maxMIn(q) because by stipulation, maxMIn(q)
represents the highest MI score of all n-grams at a
given value of n and a query q. So Normalized MI
will always fall between 0 and 1. This creates a
common specified range within which MI scores
for hybrid n-grams of different lengths can be
ranked. It is important to note that this ranking
measure is not incorporated into StringNet itself
(e.g., as a criterion for hybrid n-grams to be in-
cluded in StringNet). Rather it is a post hoc means
of ranking search results. StringNet is compatible
with other methods of ranking and contains all sta-
tistical information needed to run such alternative
measures.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.969737">
3.4 Pruning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976473684211">
As we mention above, hybrid n-grams in StringNet
consist of all possible combinations of word form,
lexeme and two types of POS in strings from 2 to 8
grams in length. Thus for every single traditional
n-gram consisting of a string of word forms, there
are numerous hybrid n-grams that also describe
that same string. For a traditional 8-gram, for ex-
ample, we create 47X2=32768 different hybrid n-
grams (taking into account our criterion that at
least one token has to be a word form or lexeme).
Such a large amount of information will cause low
performance of the StringNet applications. In or-
der to decrease the search space while still keeping
most of the useful information, we introduce prun-
ing. Specifically, pruning is intended to eliminate
redundant hybrid n-grams from searches or appli-
cations of StringNet. There are two types of prun-
ing we use in StringNet currently: Vertical pruning
and Horizontal pruning.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.412341">
Vertical pruning:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996589607142858">
Vertical pruning considers pairs of hybrid n-grams
that are identical in length and differ in the identity
of some gram in the sequence. Consider the fol-
lowing such pair.
a. hybrid n-gram 1: my point [prep] view
b. hybrid n-gram 2: my point of view
These 4-grams are identical except for the third
gram; moreover, the counterpart grams occupying
that third slot (“of” and [prep]) stand in an inclu-
sion relation, “of” being a member of the POS
category [prep]. Recalling our cross-indexing, this
parenthood relation between such hybrid n-grams
can be readily detected. Pruning of the parent oc-
curs in cases where a threshold proportion of the
instances attested in BNC of that parent are also
instances of the child. Consider (a) and (b) above.
Here the parent (a) “my point [prep] view” would
be pruned since all cases of [prep] in this pattern in
BNC are indeed cases of the preposition “of”.
Consider now (c), another parent hybrid n-gram of
(b) that, in contrast, would not be pruned.
c. hybrid n-gram 3: [dps] point of view
This parent is retained because “my” accounts
for fewer than 80% of the instances of the [dps] in
this pattern. The retention of “[dps] point of view”
indicates that more than one possessive pronoun is
attested in the [dps] slot of this string in a threshold
proportion of its cases and thus the slot shows sub-

stitutability. In a word, vertical pruning eliminates
hybrid n-grams containing POS grams which do
not represent attested substitutability. Currently,
for our StringNet search interface (LexChecker)
we prune parents with children that represent over
80% of the BNC tokens also described by that par-
ent.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.481209">
Horizontal pruning:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998926">
The main idea of Horizontal pruning is the same as
Vertical pruning. The only difference is the axis of
comparison: For horizontal pruning, two hybrid n-
grams for comparison differ only by value of n (ie.,
by length). For example, comparing the hybrid n-
gram “[dps] point of” and “[dps] point of view,”
the shorter one is parent and is pruned if a thresh-
old proportion of its instantiations in BNC are also
instances of the longer child “[dps] point of view.”
In horizontal pruning, the shorter of the two com-
pared hybrid n-grams is the potentially redundant
one and thus the candidate for pruning. As with our
MI measure, both vertical and horizontal pruning
rate are set post hoc, applied by post-processing,
and so are adjustable.

4 Illustrating with Examples
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990538775510204">
Although StringNet can support a wide range of
applications (such as error detection and correction
(Tsao and Wible 2009); document similarity meas-
urement, etc.), for ease of exposition in what fol-
lows, we take a search query as our access point to
illustrate StringNet content. Taking eye as our
query term, StringNet yields a ranked list of 3,765
hybrid n-grams containing either this lexeme or
one of its inflected forms. The following are sam-
ples from the top 50 (i.e., the first page of results):
visible [prep] the naked eye
turning a blind eye to
out of the corner of [dps] eye
[dps] eyes filled with tears
keeping an eye on the [noun]
[adv] see eye to eye
look [pers prn] straight in the eye
cast a [adj] eye [prep] (e.g., cast a critical eye
over, cast a cold eye on)
Each hybrid n-gram listed in a search result is
accompanied by links to examples and parent and
child icons that link to its parent and children hy-
brid n-grams. (See Fig 1 and 2.) Consider one of
the hybrid n-grams listed in the results for eye:
“keep a close eye on.” Recalling Fillmore et al’s
distinction between substantive and formal idioms,
in the case of “keep a close eye on” we are at the
level of the formal (lexically filled) idiom. Note
that since it is a string of lexical items, as are all
substantive idioms by definition, this sort can just
as easily be extracted and represented using tradi-
tional flat n-grams. StringNet’s hybrid n-grams and
their cross-indexing, however, allow us to see
whether this is a one-off lexically filled idiom or
an instance of a lexically open formal idiom (i.e.,
of a construction). Without hybrid n-grams, the
next step up in abstraction to determine this would
be pure POS n-grams (strings of POS categories
only) used in the literature (Feldman et al 2009;
Florian et al 2003; Gamon et al 2009). In the case
of “keep a close eye on” the corresponding POS n-
gram would be “[verb][det][adj][noun][prep].”
This, however, could describe strings as far afield
as “buy a new car with” or “sequester the entire
jury until.” Our hybrid n-grams are intended to
address this Goldilocks problem where construc-
tional phenomena fall between these two sorts of
traditional n-gram representations evading detec-
tion by both.

<bodyText confidence="0.988978194444444">
Navigating from “keep a close eye on” upward
through the pruned StringNet network using the
parent and child links, we find the parent “keep a
[adj] eye on” instantiated by attested examples
“keep a close/watchful/wary/keen eye on.” An-
other parent of “keep a close eye on” is “keep a
close [noun] on”.
Tellingly there are only two nouns attested more
than once in the noun slot in this frame: “keep a
close eye/watch on.” Both of these parents in turn
share the common parent “keep a [adj][nn1] on.”
This parent is attested by 268 tokens in BNC.
Among these, there are 80 distinct [adj][nn1] pair-
ings filling those two POS slots in this hybrid n-
gram (e.g., close eye, firm grip, tight rein, close
watch, etc.). StringNet allows the extraction of this
set of 80 [adj][nn1] pairs and indexes this set to
this specific hybrid n-gram. This enables a range of
investigations. One direction from here is to ex-
plore this particular set of 80 [adj][noun] pairs. For
example, we could take this set of pairs as a poten-
tial identifying feature set of this construction and
search StringNet for other hybrid n-grams with the
substring [adj][noun] to identify those that show a
large overlap with the 80 pairs from “keep a
[adj][noun] on.” This would constitute an approach
to detecting similar constructions or family resem-
blances between and among constructions. Another
direction is to see whether “keep” is an anchoring
lexical element of this construction or substitutable
much like the [adj] and [noun] slots. This could be
investigated in a number of ways in StringNet. For
example, by comparing “keep a [adj][noun] on”
with minimally distinct hybrid n-grams with verbs
other than “keep,” conditional or relative probabil-
ity measures could indicate whether that set of 80
[adj][noun] pairs from “keep a [adj][noun] on” is
conditioned by “keep” or independent of the par-
ticular verb in this string.
It’s the thought that counts:
For this example, we query StringNet for “count”
and get 436 distinct, unpruned hybrid n-grams for
the verb. The eight listed below include the top-
ranked 5 with 3 others sampled from the top 12,
rank order retained:
stand up and be counted
count the number of [nn2]
count [dps] blessings
it be the [noun] that count
[vm0][adv] be counted as
[pnp] [vm0] not count on
what counts as [nn1]
count [pronoun reflx] lucky
Ranked 4th among these is “it be the [noun] that
count,” attested with 21 tokens in BNC. In 9 of
these tokens, the [noun] is thought, so of course,
navigating down we find “it’s the thought that
counts” as a descendant hybrid n-gram. Numerous
aspects suggest themselves. First is the relation
between lexically filled substantive idioms and
more abstract formal idioms that host them. Start-
ing with the lexically filled “it’s the thought that
counts” and navigating upward we note that count
remains specified but can host a range of nouns in
the focus position, as indicated by our 4th ranked
“it be the [noun] that count.” The nouns attested in
this slot are: hunt, perception, topic, message, fu-
ture, critic, change, books, feelings, character,
voter, sport. Upward from here to a proto ancestor,
we reach “it be the [noun] that [verb],” a bare-
bones frame of the It Cleft construction and host to
the generations of instantiations below it.

Dependency Discovery
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999885">
In addition to relations among constructions that
StringNet encodes, it also yields up internal de-
pendencies between co-occurring grams within a
construction. A grand-daughter of the proto “It
Cleft” string is telling in this respect: “it be the
[nn1] that [vvz]”. In other words, StringNet here
indicates morphological agreement in the “It Cleft”
construction. Statistical work on the tokens of
these hybrid n-grams can detect such dependencies
automatically. Crucially, StringNet provides trac-
tion on the grammatical features of quirky aspects
of constructions, that terrain between regularity
and idiomicity that poses such persistent problems
for NLP.

deeper and more finely nuanced collocation
knowledge can be discovered when the larger con-
text of a framing construction is taken into ac-
count. Thus not just extracting [adj][noun]
collocations, but ones particular to a framing con-
struction or family of constructions. StringNet also
renders up grammatical dependencies otherwise
hard to detect since they are within the non-
canonical structures of constructions. It is hoped
that further cross-indexings of StringNet in the fu-
ture can support increasingly nuanced research on
constructions.

<abstract confidence="0.992843956521739">We describe and motivate the design of a lexico-grammatical knowledgebase called StringNet and illustrate its significance for research into constructional phenomena in English. StringNet consists of a massive archive of what we call hybrid n-grams. Unlike traditional n-grams, hybrid n-grams can consist of any co-occurring combination of POS tags, lexemes, and specific word forms. Further, we detect and represent superordinate and subordinate relations among hybrid n-grams by cross-indexing, allowing the navigation of StringNet through these hierarchies, from specific fixed expressions (“It’s the thought that counts”) up to their hosting protoconstructions (e.g. the It Cleft construction: “it’s the [noun] that [verb]”). StringNet supports discovery of grammatical dependencies (e.g., subject-verb agreement) in noncanonical configurations as well as lexical dependencies (e.g., adjective/noun collocations specific to families of constructions).</abstract>

Specifically, substantive, lexically filled idioms are readily susceptible to detection and representation by traditional n-grams. It is formal (lexically open) idioms, however, which have been identified more closely with constructions, yet they have proven much more resistant to extraction by computational means; for example, approaches using n-grams have so far shown little progress in handling this category of expression. And parsers famously have difficulties with their non-canonical structures (Baldwin et al 2004; Zhang et al 2006; inter alia). The design of StringNet is aimed at addressing three long-recognized qualities of constructions: (1) the non-canonical structures of many of them; (2) their syntagmatic mixing of fixed and substitutable slots, making them resistant to representation by traditional n-grams; and (3) the hierarchical relations holding among them, as, for example, “it’s the thought that counts” instantiates the general It Cleft construction while each arguably warrants independent status as a construction. 3 Design and Construction of StringNet 3.1 Overview In this section we descr</context>

Within the broad range of definitions for constructions, one widely shared premise is that the traditional division between lexical knowledge on the one hand and grammatical rules on the other is an artificial one. There are huge tracts of linguistic territory lying between the lexical and the grammatical which usage-attuned linguists have seen as not simply a residue of undiscovered deeper general principles but as the actual lay of the linguistic land (Bolinger 1977). We have taken this lexicogrammatical territory as a core target of the work we report here.

It has been argued for decades that constructions are central rather than peripheral to any adequate account of linguistic knowledge and that they pose substantial challenges to mainstream accounts of language (Bolinger, 1977, 1985; Fillmore, Kay, and O’Connor, 1988; Goldberg, 1995; inter ali</context>

Specifically, substantive, lexically filled idioms are readily susceptible to detection and representation by traditional n-grams. It is formal (lexically open) idioms, however, which have been identified more closely with constructions, yet they have proven much more resistant to extraction by computational means; for example, approaches using n-grams have so far shown little progress in handling this category of expression. And parsers famously have difficulties with their non-canonical structures (Baldwin et al 2004; Zhang et al 2006; inter alia). The design of StringNet is aimed at addressing three long-recognized qualities of constructions: (1) the non-canonical structures of many of them; (2) their syntagmatic mixing of fixed and substitutable slots, making them resistant to representation by traditional n-grams; and (3) the hierarchical relations holding among them, as, for example, “it’s the thought that counts” instantiates the general It Cleft construction while each arguably warrants independent status as a construction. 3 Design and Construction of StringNet 3.1 Overview In this section we describe the design of </context>
