E-learning paves the way to a new type of
course, more student centred, granulized, on
demand, and highly interactive. Natural
Language Processing (NLP) technologies
associated with other multimedia technologies
can help to address the major issues raised by
this new type of courses: interaction,
personalization and reliable information
access. This paper presents Exills, a true e-
learning solution which integrates natural
language processing tools and virtual reality1.
Exills is unique in that,, unlike most of the
language learning systems, it focuses on
improving learners’ performance rather than
learners’ competence.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930090909091">
This paper is not a theoretical paper. It
describes a true e-learning system that concentrates
on improving users’ performance in a foreign
language and integrates natural language
processing technologies.
The system, Exills (www.exills.com) represents an
innovative way of integrating Natural Language
technologies and multimedia technologies in order
to provide a visionary e-learning tool for learning
foreign languages.
Exills is the result of a close collaboration
between language teachers, specialists in virtual
reality, linguists and computer scientists. While
retaining “traditional content” such as language
exercises, grammar worksheets and speech acts,
Exills takes advantage of new technologies for
interaction (asynchronous and synchronous), game
aspect and course scenarization.
Exills has been conceived with the constant
concern for pedagogical quality and for
differentiating itself from both CDROMs and face
to face language courses. We have been careful to

<bodyText confidence="0.999696638888889">
renounce using technologies, even innovative ones,
if they did not serve the cause of a pedagogical e-
learning system. The focus has been to improve
learner’s performance rather than to insist on
improving learner’s competence2. Indeed,
experimenting with different available language
learning solutions focusing on competence (via
vocabulary exercises and grammar) led us to the
conclusion that these types of activities do not
insure that learners are then able to interact in a
foreign language. While they might acquire the
conceptual knowledge of the language they are not
necessarily able to use it in practical contexts. In
the case of Exills, learners are put into practical
situations. The situations are represented via
different scenarios. In most cases the scenario
corresponds to everyday work situations.
Exills focuses on the interaction aspect of
language learning driven by the use of the Internet,
in particular, on interaction and information access.
Interaction within Exills includes language
understanding through reading and listening. It
also improves language production in writing. As
we will see in the conclusion adding speech
technologies to Exills will enable users to also
improve on language oral production.
In the demonstration scenarios that are
accessible online, targeted users are professionals
with an intermediate level in English or French.
These scenarios put users in typical work situations
such as introducing themselves, reading emails,
searching for and understanding information,
writing and making a presentation, ordering their
meal, interacting with their colleagues and
customers. Part of the scenario is dedicated to the
discovery of cultural aspects.

2 Competence and performance as defined by
Chomsky (Chomsky, 1965): Competence is
the speaker-hearer&apos;s knowledge of his
language. Performance is the speaker-
hearer&apos;s actual use of his language in
concrete situations
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.998855264367817">
In what follows, after presenting our view of e-
learning, we describe Exills and its different
technical components. We then conclude by
suggesting other linguistic technologies that could
serve the cause of language e-learning.
How e-learning affects our way of learning
Learning through the Internet, or e-learning, paves
the way for a new type of course which, most of
the time, complements the face-to-face course
(blended learning), but can also be substituted for
the face-to-face courses. While traditional and
Computer-Based training is targeted to a group of
students, e-learning is often referred to as
“my-learning” as it is highly personalized,
granulized, on demand and highly interactive. The
characteristics of e-learning are that it provides
learners with the possibility to learn exactly what
they need, from anywhere and at any time
E-learning completely changes both the
teaching and the learning processes. Teachers
become tutors that support students’ work.
Students take more responsibility in the learning
process as they know what they need to learn to be
efficient. This is especially true in a life long
training context. They become actors in their
learning process by choosing their course topics,
elaborating their learning paths, exchanging with
other students as well as with tutors.
E-learning is definitively a new way of learning
that can take advantage of new Internet
technologies.
However, despite the explosion of e-learning
platforms also called LMS for learning
management system (see thot.cursus.edu) there are
very few systems which take real advantage of the
functionalities the Internet offers such as:
interaction, personalization and huge information
access (for both students and tutors). Indeed, most
of the current e-learning solutions are LMS that are
former Knowledge Management Systems
customized for learning. Because they have not
firstly been designed for a learning purpose they
often miss the pedagogical dimension. Other
solutions are a simple web link to already existing
CD-ROM content. This solution usually offers a
simple type of interaction such as emails with the
tutors and, sometimes, forums with other students.
Within the e-learning domain, language
learning is one of the most successful market
segments as it comes second only to IT and
marketing. This is probably due to the fact that for
many years it has been possible to learn a language
using electronic media (CD-ROM). Medium to
large publishers have been successful in
developing language training multimedia content
of good quality. Still, the majority of so-called e-
language learning solutions that are on the market
today are CD-ROM content transferred onto the
web rather that real online solutions.
The reason is probably that most of the
publishers in this area are specialists in producing
good quality pedagogical content but are not
specialists of the Internet, nor do they have the
technological resources necessary to transfer their
content onto the Web. Offering on-line content on
the web is very different from offering content on a
CD-ROM. These media organize content in a
completely different way and this has a strong
impact on the basic pedagogical principles. This
shows up at different levels. For instance, studies
have shown that users will spend at the most 15
minutes on an Internet learning session versus 45
minutes on a CD-ROM. learning. Besides, there is
the issue of how to organize learning material so
that navigation among short learning modules is
possible without affecting the learning pedagogical
process. Finally, record keeping, tracking, tracing
and flexibility are all essential functions for
making an on line course successful as well as for
keeping user motivation high. These are just a few
of the issues that need to be addressed when
creating high quality content on the Internet for
language learning.
Exills is a true e-learning solution, that on the
technological part, integrates virtual reality with
linguistic and collaborative technologies as well as
with a smart search engine.

Exills’ general features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999509571428572">
In very general terms, Exills could be described as
a hybrid between an authoring tool and a delivery
platform particularly well suited to building and
distributing language learning applications.
Exills user interface provides interactive access
to the most up-to-date Internet technologies.
The user interface is composed of:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997731333333333">
• a 3D scene to put the user in a cognitive
context in line with the topic of the course;
• a chat frame to allow students, robots and
tutors to interact via text (written
production);
• a frame to provide learners with any
information they might need as well as with
activities to do.
• a toolbar to provide learners with easy
access to specific functionalities such as: a
linguistic toolbox (contextual dictionary
look up, phonetic spell checker, conjugation
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999591789473684">
engine), a notepad to take notes, a history of
their work to review it at any time, as well
as shortcuts, through maps, to navigate
inside 3D scenes. They can also get help
from tutors, access their profile and a list of
personalized exercises, grammar
worksheets, and speech acts.
Each course is associated with a scenario. These
scenarios are usually associated with a mission to
accomplish. This mission integrates learning
activities, game aspects and competition between
students. In order to achieve the mission, learners
need to interact with each other, with the tutor as
well as with the virtual environment. Thanks to the
virtual reality this interaction takes place like in
video games. Learners play a video game in a
foreign language.
In its current incarnation Exills has the
following underlying features.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.990977">

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.751765">
Virtual reality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995956097561">
While virtual reality presents real advantages
for learning, this technology is not yet strongly
used for this purpose.
In Exills, virtual reality is used both for interaction
and for personalization. Personalization, because
when they are in virtual reality, learners can
choose a representation of themselves, also known
as an avatar, and can move around the virtual
places like in the real world. For instance, learners
can meet with other avatars/learners, interact with
them and access the Internet.
The virtual reality induces a type of
interaction that completely differs from email,
forum or face to face. Part of this difference is due
to the fact that people hide themselves behind an
avatar but also because of the game aspect
permitted by the virtual reality.
First experiments showed that in virtual
reality, as in games, people behave completely
differently and tend to interact much more. For
instance, we have noticed that while in a face to
face or in a video course, most of the time, only the
most confident students speak up; in a virtual
environment, everyone dares more to express
himself/herself. This definitively helps the tutor in
evaluating students’ ability.
To ease and push learners’ interaction, it is
important to provide them with an interaction
topic. This is where the notion of scenario comes
in and where, again, virtual reality turns out to be
an important technology. The scenario is there to
help students to interact among themselves but also
to immerse them directly into “prototypical
situations”. For instance, if students need to learn a
language for work reasons, a scenario will be built
around their everyday life at work, including the
physical work place and this induces reaction and
discussion correlated to the 3D scenes. Because it
provides learners with a reason to interact, like in
role playing games, the scenario makes interaction
more effective than in traditional chat and forums.

What is more natural than clicking on a
computer screen to access emails, than clicking on
a CD to hear music, than visiting a library to read
books or than being invited to chat with the
receptionist when arriving at the reception desk?
Because it mimics the real world, students can
enter quickly into the virtual reality environment.
Students usually just need a few hours’ training to
easily manipulate the mouse in order to move from
one virtual place to another.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.507266">
Linguistic technologies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999858055555556">
Exills adds other technologies to enhanced virtual
reality in such a way that the resulting learning
system makes real use of the potential of the
Internet.
In its current incarnation, Exills offers learners
contextual bilingual dictionaries, morphological
analyzers and syntactic taggers, a language
identifier and phonetic spell checkers. These
technologies are there to help students express
themselves or understand a foreign language.
Linguistic technologies associated with virtual
reality retain the personalized aspect of individual
courses while being immersed in the collective
course.
Within the chat, Exills offers a comprehension
help service which uses the context to first retrieve
the most appropriate translation of a word
(syntactic and semantic disambiguation). As a

<bodyText confidence="0.9980795">
result, the students’ comprehension is sped up and
interaction becomes smoother.
The same contextual dictionary look up could
be used for providing the student with a list of
sentences where the word they don’t understand
appears with the same meaning. In that case, the
pedagogical process is different: instead of
providing the student directly with the translation,
the system provides him/her with other contextual
uses of the same word
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.965181">
Figure 3: Understanding assistance.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.992534444444444">
If we now consider the linguistic analysis of
student production (chat/forum contribution,
exercise, writing, etc.), linguistic technologies
provide students with customizable services which
allow them to parse and tag their own production
in order to check its correctness. Here again the
goal is not to provide them with the correct answer,
this is left to the tutor, but rather to help them
detect their own mistakes.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.677938">
Figure 4: Through linguistic services, students can
analyze and correct their written production.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.985750222222222">
Along the same lines as “learning by example”,
linguistic tools can be used to highlight specific
language constructions such as functional relations,
terminology or idiomatic expressions.
Derivational morphology can be used to discover
the words of a same family and improve students’
vocabulary.
A simple morphological analyzer gives students
access to verb conjugations or noun declensions.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.893333">
Figure 5: Access to the conjugation of a verb
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998623357142857">
Exills also includes a language identifier to
force students to interact only in the language they
are learning. This integration relieves the tutor of
checking on each student, and pushes students to
express themselves more in that language.
The language identifier is integrated into the
chat. This module identifies the language used by a
student and if different from the one the student is
supposed to learn, the system blocks any type of
interaction. Students then receive a message saying
that they are not using the appropriate language.
The language identifier can also be plugged into
mail or forum services between students or even
between students and tutor.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.957287">

<bodyText confidence="0.990329042553192">
in the chat.
A phonetic spell checker is also available to
students to help them to learn the correct spelling
of words.
Linguistic technologies can be used to reinforce
the personalization aspect of e-learning. Indeed,
linguistic technologies open the way to learning on
any text that is of interest for the course and for
each individual learner. For instance, professionals
can work on their everyday technical
documentation and can learn their professional
terminology in a foreign language. In particular,
linguistic technologies can automatically extract
technical terminology for them.
Smart search engines
Exills uses smart search engines in order to
strengthen the personalization and interactive
aspects. Indeed, having a smart search engine that
can take into account students’ needs and interest
through a detailed user profile and can retrieve
personalized content from the web clearly
improves the personalization aspect and course
efficiency. Tutors and students can use the Internet
as an infinite source of information to enrich
course content. This is where collaborative
technologies play a crucial role. Information on the
Internet varies in quality, and it is especially
important in a course context to be able to separate
the wheat from the chaff.
Smart search engines strengthen the
personalization aspect of e-learning. They can
retrieve documents that match the user’s profile.
This user profile encompasses student-specific
difficulties in the courses as well as the student’s
personal interest, be it for work reasons or in life in
general. An example of this is a student who is
interested in American politics and has difficulties
with the use of idiomatic expressions in French. A
smart search engine uses morpho-syntactic
analysis of the retrieved text as well as an ontology
to provide the student with texts about American
politics that contain idioms. Using smart meta-
search engines permits a search on the Intranet as
well as on student emails. This is especially useful
in a context of professional language learning
courses. In that case, the search can be performed
on technical texts from the company.

<bodyText confidence="0.974993111111111">
Collaborative technologies
Within Exills, collaborative technologies are used
to filter information found on the web by
commenting and interacting on it. At the end of the
interaction process, the tutor will decide which
documents will be retained to enrich the content of
the course.
Using collaborative technologies impacts the two
kinds of users in several ways.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.946910666666667">
• First, the students. Using this tool and
contributing to its content allows the student
community to have access to a very
qualified and annotated text database.
• Second, the tutors. Tutors can use the
community repository in two different ways:
first, to get specific and adequate content in
order to generate new exercises or activities;
second, to evaluate the level and the
understanding of the students by analyzing
their comments on the different documents
posted.

Infinite number of possible scenarios
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968363636364">
The Exills scenario that is currently available on
the Internet relates to professionals working for a
printing company. It is just one of many possible
scenarios. In fact, Exills permits the construction
of an infinite number of scenarios. This possibility
also points out the high pedagogical adaptability of
Exills which leaves to the tutor the possibility to
decide about scenario, content and activities. In the
next sections we give some examples of other
possible scenarios that could use Exills as an
underlying framework.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.737741">
Schools
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992076923077">
In an academic context, it is possible to organize
virtual travel for students, similar to language
exchanges that already exist. In that, case pupils
from two different countries connect at the same
time and organize a virtual tour of their school,
their district, their city, they describe their cultural
habits. In this type of experiment one class plays
the role of the tutor and corrects the language of
the other class.
This kind of experimentation is known as
‘Tandem’ in the pedagogical domain. According to
several studies, this way of learning languages is
more efficient as pupils are more motivated.

One important pedagogical consequence of the
notion of scenario is that it allows users to learn
both a work process and a foreign language.
Another scenario, we are currently working on,
is targeted to people working at hotels reception

of an eContent European project, Thetis

GDT4) and a research center (Xerox Research
Centre Europe5).
To summarize, while using linguistic technologies,
students can process online texts on the fly and can
work on their own documents. This strengthens the
personalization aspect of the solution. Going
forward, using Exills in a professional context
allows students to work on the documents of their
own company.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.381126">
Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983219512195">
Exills has been tested in different contexts. We
tested the current scenario (professional working
for a printing company) in language schools as
well as in companies. In all cases we have spent
two hours beforehand with the tutors to train them
with the concept as well as with virtual reality.
Between the training of the tutor and the real test
we allowed one week so that tutors can get familiar
with the environment. We attended the testing just
to help in case of technical problems. We
distributed a questionnaire at the end so that users
can immediately provide us with feedback. The
feedback was globally highly positive. Users like
the game aspect, although sometime they would
prefer a non professional scenario. Because of this
game dimension they tend to use the linguistic
technologies more than usual and in particular the
contextual bilingual dictionary look-up. This
demonstrates that the wish to interact combined
with the impossibility of speaking any other
languages, because of the language identifier, push
them to use linguistic technologies to progress.
Teachers like the language identifier as it
relieves them of checking on the language students
use. They report on the fact that correcting on the
fly is sometimes difficult because the chat is so
quick between participants. In any case they do
have the possibility of correcting any student
production afterwards as everything is stored on
the server.
The other context where we tested Exills is
within classrooms. In that case users were
teenagers from age 13 to 14. This type of
population is obviously very comfortable with
virtual reality and the game aspect. Again they
enjoy very much the fact that they learn a language
while playing a game, and again they made
extensive use of the linguistic technologies to be
able to write sentences. School teachers were
impressed by the fact that their students stayed
attentive for the entire course. This should

probably be balanced by the novelty aspect of the
system.
One thing we have not yet been able to test, but
which would be very interesting to evaluate, is the
difference in users performance in language after
having used Exills.
We are now working with a research team of
specialists in pedagogical issue to define a
methodology that could measure this performance.

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999212666666667">
To summarize, Exills integrates virtual reality,
linguistic, collaborative and smart search
technologies into a true e-learning solution that can
be used both synchronously and asynchronously.
Thanks to this technology integration Exills
allows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.861922714285714">
• Students to benefit from the interest’s
potential for interaction, , to have a
controlled and efficient access to the
information on the Internet, to learn by
themselves at their own rhythm.
• Tutors to get support in supervising their
students.
• Learning companies to offer courses based
on a new concept (virtual reality and
linguistic technologies) instead of just
putting classical lessons on the web.
• End-user companies to have a course
completely customized to their needs, their
working environment and their terminology.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999894857142857">
Exills is a true e-learning solution created to take
advantage of the web. By taking advantage of the
interaction, Exills escapes the drawbacks of many
e-learning solutions such as: the strenuousness of
reading notices, the impression for students of
being left to their own devices, or the temptation to
give up the course. This is made possible because:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.923956">

for the students and pushes them to interact.
• Smart search technologies allow one get

<bodyText confidence="0.876002871794872">
information, texts and documents from the
Internet or specialized databases related to a
specific subject matching the language level
of the student.
• Collaborative technologies allow the sharing
of information gathered on the Internet
between students and the provision of
adequate content to the tutor to create new
exercises or lessons almost on the fly.
• Linguistic tools provide autonomy to
students by showing them concepts, give
them assistance to understand word
meanings or different senses within a
particular context by presenting various
examples, to provide feedback for their
production (in the chat as well as during
exercises or even free activities).
Clearly Exills would benefit from adding new
technologies and in particular speech technologies.
With speech technologies, students would be able
to interact via voice, to record themselves and to
compare their own oral production to a model.
Finally, the linguistic technologies
presented in this paper could also be used to
provide more functionality. For instance,
morphology and tagging could be used in order to
automatically create online filling-in-the-blank
type of exercise from any text found on the
Internet: The process is quite similar to the
exercises generator framework but the
functionalities provided to the student are fewer:
given a text and an exercise pattern, the exercise is
generated just for her/him. This exercise is then
corrected automatically using pattern matching,
morphology or spellchecker.
Part of these ideas, especially the speech
components6, will now be implemented in the
framework of Thetis, the on-going European
project mentioned before.

<abstract confidence="0.9981506875">E-learning paves the way to a new type of course, more student centred, granulized, on demand, and highly interactive. Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies associated with other multimedia technologies can help to address the major issues raised by this new type of courses: interaction, personalization and reliable information access. This paper presents Exills, a true elearning solution which integrates natural processing tools and virtual Exills is unique in that,, unlike most of the language learning systems, it focuses on improving learners’ performance rather than learners’ competence.</abstract>

In the demonstration scenarios that are accessible online, targeted users are professionals with an intermediate level in English or French. These scenarios put users in typical work situations such as introducing themselves, reading emails, searching for and understanding information, writing and making a presentation, ordering their meal, interacting with their colleagues and customers. Part of the scenario is dedicated to the discovery of cultural aspects. 2 Competence and performance as defined by Chomsky (Chomsky, 1965): Competence is the speaker-hearer&apos;s knowledge of his language. Performance is the speakerhearer&apos;s actual use of his language in concrete situations In what follows, after presenting our view of elearning, we describe Exills and its different technical components. We then conclude by suggesting other linguistic technologies that could serve the cause of language e-learning. How e-learning affects our way of learning Learning through the Internet, or e-learning, paves the way for a new type of course which, most of the time, complements the face-to-face course (blended learning), but can also b</context>
