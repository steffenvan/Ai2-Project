The task of extracting the opinion expressed in
text is challenging due to different reasons.
One of them is that the same word (in particu-
lar, adjectives) can have different polarities
depending on the context. This paper presents
the experiments carried out by the OpAL team
for the participation in the SemEval 2010 Task
18 – Disambiguation of Sentiment Ambiguous
Adjectives. Our approach is based on three dif-
ferent strategies: a) the evaluation of the polar-
ity of the whole context using an opinion min-
ing system; b) the assessment of the polarity of
the local context, given by the combinations
between the closest nouns and the adjective to
be classified; c) rules aiming at refining the lo-
cal semantics through the spotting of modifi-
ers. The final decision for classification is tak-
en according to the output of the majority of
these three approaches. The method used
yielded good results, the OpAL system run
ranking fifth among 16 in micro accuracy and
sixth in macro accuracy.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999175">
Recent years have marked the beginning and ex-
pansion of the Social Web, in which people free-
ly express and respond to opinion on a whole
variety of topics. Moreover, at the time of taking
a decision, more and more people search for in-
formation and opinions expressed on the Web on
their matter of interest and base their final deci-
sion on the information found (Pang and Lee,
2008). Nevertheless, the high quantity of data
that has to be analysed imposed the development
of specialized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) systems that automatically extract, classi-
fy and summarize the opinions available on the
web on different topics. Research in this field, of
opinion mining (sentiment analysis), has ad-
dressed the problem of extracting and classifying
opinions from different perspectives and at dif-
ferent levels, depending on various factors.
While determining the overall opinion on a mov-
ie is sufficient for taking the decision to watch it
or not, when buying a product, people are inter-
ested in the individual opinions on the different
product characteristics. Especially in this con-
text, opinion mining systems are confronted with
a difficult problem: the fact that the adjectives
used to express opinion have different polarities
depending on the characteristic they are men-
tioned with. For example, “high price” is nega-
tive, while “high resolution” is positive. There-
fore, specialized methods have to be employed to
correctly determine the contextual polarity of
such words and thus accurately assign polarity to
the opinion.
This is the aim of the SemEval 2010 Task 18 –
Disambiguation of Sentiment Ambiguous Adjec-
tives (Wu and Jin, 2010). In the following sec-
tions, we first present state-of-the art approaches
towards polarity classification of opinions, sub-
sequently describing our approach in the SemEv-
al task. Finally, we present the results we ob-
tained in the evaluation and our plans for future
work.

Subjectivity analysis is defined by (Wiebe, 1994)
as the “linguistic expression of somebody’s opi-
nions, sentiments, emotions, evaluations, beliefs
and speculations”. Sentiment analysis, on the
other hand, is defined as the task of extracting,
from a text, the opinion expressed on an object
(product, person, topic etc.) and classifying it as
positive, negative or neutral. The task of senti-
ment analysis, considered a step further to sub-
jectivity analysis, is more complex than the lat-
ter, because it involves an extra step: the classifi-
cation of the retrieved opinion words according
to their polarity. There are a series of techniques
that were used to obtain lexicons of subjective
words – e.g. the Opinion Finder lexicon (Wilson
et al., 2005) and opinion words with associated
polarity. (Hu and Liu, 2004) start with a set of
seed adjectives (“good” and “bad”) and apply
synonymy and antonymy relations in WordNet.
A similar approach was used in building Word-
Net Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004),
starting from a larger set of seed affective words,
classified according to the six basic categories of
emotion (joy, sadness, fear, surprise, anger and
disgust) and expanding the lexicon using paths in
WordNet. Another related method was used in
the creation of SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebas-
tiani, 2005), using a set of seed words whose po-
larity was known and expanded using gloss simi-
larity. The collection of appraisal terms in (Whi-
telaw et al., 2005), the terms also have polarity
assigned. MicroWNOp (Cerini et al., 2007),
another lexicon containing opinion words with
their associated polarity, was built on the basis of
a set of terms extracted from the General Inquirer
lexicon and subsequently adding all the synsets
in WordNet where these words appear. Other
methods built sentiment lexicons using the local
context of words. (Pang et al., 2002) built a lex-
icon of sentiment words with associated polarity
value, starting with a set of classified seed adjec-
tives and using conjunctions (“and”) disjunctions
(“or”, “but”) to deduce orientation of new words
in a corpus. (Turney, 2002) classifies words ac-
cording to their polarity on the basis of the idea
that terms with similar orientation tend to co-
occur in documents. Thus, the author computes
the Pointwise Mutual Information score between
seed words and new words on the basis of the
number of AltaVista hits returned when querying
the seed word and the word to be classified with
the “NEAR” operator. In our work in (Balahur
and Montoyo, 2008a), we compute the polarity
of new words using “polarity anchors” (words
whose polarity is known beforehand) and Nor-
malized Google Distance (Cilibrasi and Vitanyi,
2006) scores. Another approach that uses the po-
larity of the local context for computing word
polarity is (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), who use
a weighting function of the words around the
context to be classified.

4 The OpAL system at SemEval 2010
Task 18
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979825">
In the SemEval 2010 Task 18, the participants
were given a set of contexts in Chinese, in which
14 dynamic sentiment ambiguous adjectives are
selected. They are: )C|big, i1,,|small, �|many, �iJ
|few, A|high, 9|low, A-7-|thick, Vi|thin, M|deep,
&amp;|shallow, 1|heavy, 轻|light, V_ |huge, 1�C
|grave. The task was to automatically classify the
polarity of these adjectives, i.e. to detect whether
their sense in the context is positive or negative.
The contexts were given in two forms: as plain
text, in which the adjective to be classified was
marked; in the second for, the text was tokenized
and the tokens were tagged with part of speech
(POS). There was no training set provided.
Our approach uses a set of opinion mining re-
sources and an opinion mining system that is
implemented to work for English. This is why,
the first step we took in our approach was to
translate the given contexts into English using
the Google Translator1. In order to perform this
task, we first split the initial file into 10 smaller
files, using a specialized program – GSplit32.
The OpAL adjective polarity disambiguation
system combines supervised methods with unsu-
pervised ones. In order to judge the polarity of
the adjectives, it uses three types of judgments.
The first one is the general polarity of the con-
text, determined by our in-house opinion mining
system - based on SVM machine learning on the
NTCIR data and the EmotiBlog (Boldrini et al.,
2009) annotations and different subjectivity, opi-
nion and emotion lexica (Opinion Finder, Mi-
croWordNet Opinion, General Inquirer, Word-
Net Affect, emotion triggers (Balahur and Mon-
toyo, 2008b). The second one is the local polari-
ty, given by the highest number of results ob-
tained when issuing queries containing the clos-
est noun with the adjective to be disambiguated
followed by the conjunction “AND” and a prede-
fined set of 6 adjectives whose polarity is non-

“good” and 3 negative – “negative”, “ugly”,
“bad”. An example of such queries is “price high
and good”. The third component is made up of
rules, depending on the presence of specific
modifiers in a window of 4 words before the ad-
jective. The final verdict is given based on the
vote given by the majority of the three compo-
nents, explained in detail in the next sections:

First, we process each context using Minipar3.
We compute, for each word in a sentence, a se-
ries of features, computed from the NTCIR 7
data and the EmotiBlog annotations. These
words are used to compute vectors of features for
each of the individual contexts:
the part of speech (POS)
opinionatedness/intensity - if the word is
annotated as opinion word, its polarity, i.e. 1
and -1 if the word is positive or negative, re-
spectively and 0 if it is not an opinion word,
its intensity (1, 2 or 3) and 0 if it is not a
subjective word

EmotiBlog the list of opinion words found in the

This approach aimed at determining the polarity
of the context immediately surrounding the ad-

adjective in the context given, and issued six dif-

defined adjectives whose polarity is known (3

negative – “negative”, “ugly”, “bad”). The form
of the queries was “noun+adjective+AND+pre-
defined adjective”. The local polarity was consi-
dered as the one for which the query issued the
highest number of total results (total number of
results for the 3 queries corresponding to the pos-

This rule accounts for the original, most fre-

high is positive, low is negative). For each of
them, we define its default polarity. Subsequent-
ly, we determine whether in the window of 4
words around the adjective there are any modifi-
ers (valence shifters). If this is the case, and they
have an opposite value of polarity, the adjective
is assigned a polarity value opposite from its de-
fault one (e.g. too high is negative). We employ
a list of 82 positive and 87 negative valence shif-
ters.

Since the gold standard was not provided, we
were not able to perform an exhaustive analysis
of the errors. However, from a random inspec-
tion of the system results, we could see that a
large number of errors was due to the translation
– through which modifiers are placed far from

<bodyText confidence="0.99995519047619">
In this article we presented our approach towards
the disambiguation of polarity ambiguous adjec-
tives depending on the context in which they ap-
pear. The OpAL system’s run was based on three
subcomponents working in English – one assess-
ing the overall polarity of the context using an
opinion mining system, the second assessing the
local polarity using Google queries formed by
expressions containing the noun present in the
context before the adjective to be classified and
the third one evaluating contextual polarity based
on the adjective’s default value and the modifiers
around it. The final output is based on the vote
given by the majority of the three components.
The approach had a good performance, the
OpAL system run ranking fifth among 16 runs.
Future work includes the separate evaluation of
the three components and their combination in a
unique approach, using machine learning, as well
as a thorough assessment of errors that are due to
translation.

Moreover, at the time of taking a decision, more and more people search for information and opinions expressed on the Web on their matter of interest and base their final decision on the information found (Pang and Lee, 2008). Nevertheless, the high quantity of data that has to be analysed imposed the development of specialized Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems that automatically extract, classify and summarize the opinions available on the web on different topics. Research in this field, of opinion mining (sentiment analysis), has addressed the problem of extracting and classifying opinions from different perspectives and at different levels, depending on various factors.

Especially in this context, opinion mining systems are confronted with a difficult problem: the fact that the adjectives used to express opinion have different polarities depending on the characteristic they are mentioned with. For example, “high price” is negative, while “high resolution” is positive. Therefore, specialized methods have to be employed to correctly determine the contextual polarity of such words and thus accurately assign polarity to the opinion. This is the aim of the SemEval 2010 Task 18 – Disambiguation of Sentiment Ambiguous Adjectives (Wu and Jin, 2010).
