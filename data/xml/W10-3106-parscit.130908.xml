One emergent field in text mining tools ap-
plied to biological texts is the automatic de-
tection of speculative sentences. In this pa-
per, we test on a large scale BioExcom, a
rule-based system which annotates and ca-
tegorizes automatically speculative sen-
tences (“prior” and “new”). This work
enables us to highlight a more restrictive
way to consider speculations, viewed as a
source of knowledge, and to discuss the cri-
teria used to determine if a sentence is spe-
culative or not. By doing so, we demonstrate
the efficiency of BioExcom to extract these
types of speculations and we argue the im-
portance of this tool for biologists, who are
also interested in finding hypotheses.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999895046153847">
In one of the first studies about biological
speculations in Natural Language Processing,
Light et al. (2004) have reported that biologists
can have a dual posture concerning this sub-
ject:
“In the context of information retrieval, an ex-
ample information need might be `I am looking
for speculations about the X gene in liver tis-
sue.” One of the authors spoke at a research
department of a drug company and the biolo-
gists present expressed this sort of information
need. On the other hand, one of the authors has
also encountered the opposite need: `I am look-
ing for definite statements about transcription
factors that interact with NF Kappa B.” Both
these information needs would be easier to ful-
fill if automated annotation of speculative pas-
sages was possible.” (Light et al., 2004)
In this quotation, the term “speculation” has
not exactly the same meaning in these two
statements (depending if it comes from compu-
tational linguists or from biologists). Indeed,
because biologists are almost interested in
knowing only factual statements, the informa-
tion extraction tools have to remove all uncer-
tain statements, identified as hedging or specu-
lation, or at least to present them separately
from definite results. Consequently, the vast
majority of Natural Language Processing tools
dealing with the identification of speculation
have followed this very large meaning of the
word “speculation”, in order to avoid extract-
ing uncertain information as factual informa-
tion (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2008; Medlock,
2008; Szarvas, 2008; Morante and Daelemans,
2009; Özgur and Radev, 2009). To help im-
prove the information extraction tools, a cor-
pus, called BioScope, has been annotated for
speculation, negation and its linguistic scopes
in biomedical texts (Szarvas et al., 2008).
However, when a biologist says he is inter-
ested in knowing all speculations about a bio-
logical entity (gene or protein for example) or
a biological process, this claim concerns
another meaning of the word “speculation”.
The latter is in this case more restrictive than
previously, and close to the notion of hypothe-
sis and uncertain proposal. This interest of bi-
ologists can be explained by different reasons.
Firstly, since speculations give meaning to re-
sults, they sometimes carry more useful infor-
mation than factual sentences. In addition, spe-
culative sentences emphasize important data,
which can be very useful in data-collection
papers (genomic and post-genomic papers, see
(Brent and Lok, 2005)). Finally, speculations
can also give current trends or directions, by
enabling the researchers to anticipate future
experimental discoveries, or by suggesting
other ways to envision biological problems and
giving new ideas for future experiments (Bla-
gosklonny and Pardee, 2002). Hence, despite
its importance for biologists, the need to find
speculation according to this view has been
neglected until now in Natural Language

Processing. To our knowledge, the only work
focusing specifically on this issue is the devel-
opment of the rule-based system BioExcom
(Desclés et al., 2009). Since BioExcom has
obtained good results for detecting specula-
tions but in a relatively small scale evaluation,
it seems useful to test this tool on a large, un-
known corpus like BioScope. Furthermore, it is
important to compare in greater detail these
two different approaches to characterize spe-
culative sentences and see more precisely in
what they differ.
We performed an automatic annotation of
the BioScope corpus by BioExcom and we
measured raw performance. We observed that
the vast majority of the divergences between
BioExcom results and BioScope were due to
the criteria used for detecting a speculative
sentence. We manually treated the diverging
sentences in order to correctly evaluate BioEx-
com according to its own criteria.
The contributions of this paper are the fol-
lowing:
. We present an original approach for consi-
dering speculative sentences in bio text min-
ing. It concerns the definition of a specula-
tion, the criteria used to find it and its im-
portance for biologists.
. We demonstrate the efficiency of BioEx-
com to recognize these statements on a
large-scale evaluation with good results.
. According to this new approach we pro-
vide an annotated corpus freely available in
order to be used by researchers.

Hyland (1995) has extensively studied hedg-
ing, from a linguistic perspective, (the term of
hedging has been introduced by Lakoff (1972))
in biological papers. Hedging represents an
absence of certainty and is employed to
indicate either a lack of commitment to the
truth value of an accompanying proposition;
either a desire not to express that commitment
categorically. Three main functions are
outlined for hedging: weakening the strength
of a statement, signalling uncertainty and
expressing deference to the reader.
From a Natural Language Processing pers-
pective, the first work was carried out by Light
et al. (2004). After a linguistic study of the use
of speculative language in MEDLINE ab-
stracts, the authors tested the possibility of ma-
nually annotating the speculative sentences by
experts and linguists whilst providing small
annotation guidelines. They concluded that
humans can reliably annotate speculative sen-
tences but that it is not possible to distinguish
between “high” speculations and “low” specu-
lations. Furthermore they performed an expe-
riment with different automated methods based
principally on the retrieval of keywords. Wil-
bur et al. (2006) defined five qualitative di-
mensions for scientific text annotations. Two
of them concerned speculative statements (cer-
tainty and evidence) and they defined various
guidelines for annotating text using them.
Medlock and Briscone (2007) provided
much more detailed guidelines for hedge de-
tection. A linguist and a domain expert without
any input into the guideline development
process, labelled a publicly available dataset
(FlyBase dataset, consisting of 6 papers on
Drosophila melanogaster) in order to perform
a probabilistic acquisition model and to test it.
A separation of the acquisition and classifica-
tion phases in semi-supervised machine learn-
ing was used.
Svarzas (2008) managed to devise a hedge
classification in biomedical texts based on a
weakly supervised selection of keywords. To
evaluate their system, they manually annotated
four papers of BMC Bioinformatics with the
same criteria as Medlock and Briscone (2007).
They obtained an F-Measure of 85% on the
FlyBase dataset and an F-Measure of 75% on
the BMC Bioinformatics dataset, when the
training was carried out with the FlyBase data-
set, demonstrating that the probability of their
hedge classifiers is limited.
To recognize speculative sentences, Kili-
coglu and Bergler (2008) also used speculative
keywords from prior linguistic work and ex-
panded them by WordNet, UMLS Specialist
Lexicon, and by introducing syntactic patterns.
In order to determine the speculative strength
of sentences, they assigned speculative cues to
weights in two methods. They worked on the
two publicly available corpora, obtaining an F-
Measure of 85% on the FlyBase data set and
an F-Measure of 82% on the BMC Bioinfor-
matics data.
The BioScope corpus is a manually anno-
tated corpus for speculation and negation key-
words (token level), and their linguistic scopes
(sentence level) (Szarvas et al., 2008). This
corpus is publicly available1 and the annotation

process has been performed by two indepen-
dent annotators and a chief linguist. In particu-
lar, the corpus consists of 9 full texts papers
(five papers from the FlyBase dataset and four
papers from the journal BMC Bioinformatics),
and 1273 abstracts (from the Genia Corpus
(Collier et al., 1999)). The annotation guide-
lines are provided and speculation is identified
to uncertainty and hedging. However the crite-
ria used here are not detailed very accurately,
unlike the detailed work of Medlock and Bris-
cone (2007).
In order to detect hedging but also their
scope, two recent works were recently
published. Morante and Daelemans (2009)
present a machine learning system based on a
previous system used to detect the scope of
negation cues. Thus they show that the same
scope finding system can be applied to both
negation and hedging. They used the three
subcropora of the BioScope corpus to test the
efficiency of their system: the best F-Measures
they obtained were 85% on the abstracts (10-
fold cross-validation experiments), 72% on the
Full Text Papers and 60% on the Clinical
reports for hedge detection (training phase on
the full abstract subcorpus). Özgur and Radev
(2009) built also a system that detects specula-
tions and their scopes in biomedical scientific
texts. They performed a supervised classifica-
tion task, where they classified the potential
keywords as real speculation keywords or not
by using a diverse set of linguistic features that
represent the contexts of the keywords. They
obtained F-Measure of 92% for the scientific
abstracts (10-fold cross-validation
experiments). The F-Measure for Full Text
Papers (leave-one-out-cross-validation) was
83%.

EXCOM2 (Djioua et al., 2006; Alrahabi, 2010)
is a rule-based system using the computational
principles of the Contextual Exploration
processing (Desclés, 2006). EXCOM does not
need any morpho-syntactic analysis and only
requires one pre-treatment step of corpus seg-
mentation into segments (which are sentences
or sometimes clauses according to the punctua-
tion) (Figure 1). EXCOM uses declarative
rules built by linguists or domain experts and
based on the search for linguistic markers in
the text. The latter are hierarchically organized
2 http://www.excom.fr/
into the rules: they are either indicators (strong
markers) or clues (complementary markers).
Only the presence of indicators in the text
triggers the associated CE rules, and then the
additional clues can be searched for in the
context defined by the rules, which is in our
case the same sentence as the indicator (Figure
2).

EXCOM allows the use of already
annotated segments as markers, and also to
order the rules and to use “negative” clues that
cancel certain rules. The clues can be arranged
between each other and versus the indicator (at
its left, right or inside it). They are used to con-
firm, invalidate or specify an annotation car-
ried by an indicator. If all the examined
conditions of a rule are satisfied, EXCOM
attributes the corresponding annotation to the
designated segment. Generally the indicators
are interconnected into graphs called “semantic
maps” (Alrahabi and Desclés, 2008). EXCOM
has been used for various tasks such as auto-
matic summarization, relationships between
concepts, categorization of bibliographic cita-
tions and reported speech.
BioExcom is the system that uses the anno-
tation performed by EXCOM thanks to
specific linguistic resources built for detecting
speculations in biomedical papers (Desclés et
al., 2009). Furthermore, BioExcom performs
an indexation of the annotated segments in or-
der to provide the possibility of searching for

specific terms. The rules used for the annota-
tion processing are based on a precise semantic
analysis of the multiple ways to express specu-
lation performed by an expert in about seventy
biological papers. BioExcom also categorizes
speculative segments into “new speculation”
(speculative sentences presented for the first
time in the paper or not explicitly presented as
prior speculation) and “prior speculation”
(speculative sentences cited in the paper, but
presented as having been proposed previously).
BioExcom uses thirty rules, based on twelve
indicator classes.

The criteria used to find speculations are de-
scribed in detailed annotation guidelines,
which are available on line3. Only the seg-
ments containing at least one linguistic element
expressing speculation are considered. A spec-
ulation is defined as a proposal still not dem-
onstrated about a biological issue and explicit-
ly presented as uncertain in the paper. Thus,
speculations are considered as potential
sources of relevant information for biologists.
Others types of statements such as deductions,
conclusions, arguments and discussions are not
considered as speculative but as intermediary
statements, because they either present con-
cepts more or less certain, or they do not make
a proposal.
It is worth noting that contrary to other ap-
proaches, like Medlock (2008), the open ques-
tions are not speculative because they only ask
a question about a biological problem without
proposing a mechanism (sentence 1).

In order to better illustrate what a proposal
is and how BioExcom performs annotation we
can compare this sentence with the example
(2) where BioExcom finds the indicator “is not
known”. Nevertheless, as the goal of this tool is
not to extract all sentences expressing
uncertainty, BioExcom searches for the clue
“whether” at the right or at the left of the indi-
cator. The presence of this clue indicates that,
contrary to the sentence (1) with “how”, the
sentence (2) proposes a mechanism and
consequently is a speculation.

The sentences which discuss a speculation
without being informative about the content of
the speculation are also not considered as
speculations (sentence 3, extracted from the
guidelines of Medlock (2008)). Indeed the goal
of BioExcom is to detect a sentence explaining,
at least partially, a speculation, and not to
know, as the example (3), whether a specula-
tion is purely speculative or is supported (or
not) by facts. For the same reason, BioExcom
extracts speculation without taking into ac-
count whether this speculation is denied or not.
(3) The rescue of the D-mib mutant
phenotype by ectopic expression of
Neur strongly supports this
interpretation
At present, the evaluation process of BioEx-
com has only been performed on a relatively
small scale (2 full-text papers read by five ex-
perts and containing 59 speculative sentences
in total) and after the automatic annotation
process (Desclés et al., 2009). Promising re-
sults have been reported for BioExcom in de-
tecting speculations, by providing a high Preci-
sion of 98,3%, and a Recall of 95,1% (F-
Measure of 96,7%). This rate is consistent with
the goal of BioExcom to be a monitoring and
decision support tool.

The Bioscope corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008)
consists of three parts; namely medical free
texts, biological full papers and biological
scientific abstracts. However in this test, we
only used two parts of the Bioscope corpus
(full papers and abstracts) because we were
preferentially interested in the biomedical
scientific domain.
First, we cleaned the corpus from all element
tags (angled brackets marking hedge keywords
and parentheses marking scopes) and saved
these documents into text files. The latter could
then be automatically segmented into sen-
tences or clauses and semantically annotated
by BioExcom. As a result of this processing,
BioExcom automatically extracted 341 seg-
ments from the Full Text Papers Corpus and
1489 segments from the Abstract Corpus (1830
segments in total)4. We could then compare
our output files with the Bioscope Corpus
which contained manual annotations. In this
task we do not consider the categorization of
BioExcom (“new speculation” and “prior
speculation”) and these annotated sentences
are only considered as speculative. Thus, we
obtained the results presented in Table 1. Con-
sistent with the previous evaluation performed
on BioExcom (Desclés et al., 2009), the Preci-
sion is high (approximately 93% in average,
calculated from the total of segments of the
two corpora). Nevertheless, the Recall dramat-
ically falls to approximately 68% (in average)
compared to the first evaluation (Recall of
93%).

If we compare the speculative keywords in-
dicated in BioScope (underlined) and the
markers used by BioExcom, we see some con-
vergences (“suggests” and “may” for the sen-
tences (4) and (5)), but also some divergences.
In the sentence (6), BioExcom uses “hypothe-
sis that” as an indicator in order to extract in-
formative speculations and not only sentences
containing the word “hypothesis”. The exam-
ple of the sentence (7) is much more illustra-
tive for the differences: whereas only “wheth-
er” is taken into account as a keyword in Bi-
oScope, BioExcom uses “to determine” as an
indicator and “whether” as a positive clue, al-
lowing extracting only sentences containing a
proposal (see example 2). The minimalist
strategy (searching for the minimal unit that
expresses speculation) followed by the annota-
tors of BioScope for the keywords can explain
these observations.

Our goal was to evaluate the performance of
BioExcom according to its own definition of
speculation. To analyze the observed low Re-
call (Table 1), we assumed that all sentences
presenting an agreement between both me-
thods (manual annotation in BioScope and au-
tomatic annotation by BioExcom) were cor-
rectly annotated and we checked manually all
the segments (984 segments) presenting a di-
vergence of annotation. This checking was per-
formed by a biologist as chief evaluator (writer

of the annotation guidelines) and two indepen-
dent linguists, not allowed to communicate
with each other. None of these evaluators knew
the annotation performed by BioExcom or in
BioScope (blind study). The conflicts were
resolved by discussions during regular meet-
ings and, in case of important uncertainty for at
least two annotators, the sentences (54 in total)
were not taken into account. The BioScope
corpus re-annotated according to the criteria of
BioExcom is publicly available5.
We can divide the segments presenting a
disagreement between BioExcom and BioS-
cope into two groups depending on the annota-
tion performed either automatically by BioEx-
com or manually in the BioScope corpus (Fig-
ure 3).
The first group consists of 865 segments
which were considered as speculations in Bi-
oScope (representing around 36% of the total
of annotated sentences in BioScope) and which
were not annotated by BioExcom (see Figure
2). After manual checking, we found that only
around one third of these segments in the cor-
pus Full papers were speculative according to
the criteria of BioExcom. This proportion was
around one fourth in the BioScope corpus Ab-
stract. The goal of BioExcom to avoid annotat-
ing open questions (see examples (1-2)) or lack
of knowledge (sentence (8)) can explain some
of the absences of annotation by BioExcom.
(8) The exact role of the ubiquitination
pathway in regulating apoptosis is still
unclear.
In other cases, some differences linked to
the semantic conception of speculation play a
role. Thus, the following sentences are consi-
dered as speculative in BioScope:

housekeeping ALAS precursor of mo-

Although these sentences correspond to
hedging as it has been defined by Hyland
(1995), we argue that the sentences (9-10) can
be characterized more as a demonstration or a
deduction with the expressions “indicate that”
and “it can be deduced” than a speculation.
According to the criteria used for establishing
BioExcom rules, these sentences do not cor-
respond to a speculation because they present
things more or less as certain (see also
(Thompson et al., 2008)). In this view, the case
of “indicate that” is interesting to be detailed.
Whereas many studies use it as a linguistic
marker of speculation, Kilicoglu and Bergler
(2008) recently moderated its speculative
meaning by highlighting the additional need to
take into account its context. The linguistic
analysis used to establish the rules in BioEx-
com is much more restrictive and does not
consider it as a marker.
It should also be mentioned that we noticed a
few sentences which were incorrectly anno-
tated in BioScope as speculation. Thus, the
sentence (11) is rather, in our opinion, a defi-
nite statement (“or” can be replaced by “and”).
(11) Tandem copies of this 67-bp MnlI-AluI
fragment, when fused to the
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
gene driven by the conalbumin
promoter, stimulated transcription in
B cells but not in Jurkat T cells or
HeLa cells.
There are also some sentences annotated in
Bioscope which are undoubtedly speculations
but they were not identified by BioExcom.
Thus, BioExcom has not annotated some spe-
culative sentences because of the lack of some
accurate markers into its linguistic resources.
This is the case in the sentence (12): “seems” is
recognized by BioExcom only when it is asso-
ciated with some adjectives (“seems probable”
for example). We can also cite the more ambi-
guous case of “predicted” (sentence (13))
which is also absent from the linguistic re-
sources of BioExcom. Although a prediction
can be considered as having a more particular
status because it presents a low degree of un-
certainty, we can consider that it should be
taken into account because the predicted pro-
posal remains hypothetical.

does not allow the detection of some specula-

presence of some positive clues expressing
conditionality or possibility, such as “if” or
“whether”. But in the sentence (14), “could”
has no clues to be disambiguated and although
it is a speculation, BioExcom did not annotate
it.

The second group consists of segments anno-

these sentences appeared to be speculative af-

BioScope.

Finally, based on these results, we decided to
recalculate the Precision, Recall and F-
Measure to be more in agreement with the no-
tion of speculation as it has been described by
Desclés et al. (2009) (last lines in Tables 2 and
3). Corrected Precision, Recall and F-Measure
are respectively around 99%, 83% and 90%
(averages calculated from the total of segments
of the two corpora). These results are close to
the first evaluation performed by Desclés et al.
(2009), even if Recall is still lower than pre-
viously.
Obviously, our results are not directly com-
parable with the prior studies because BioEx-
com does not use exactly the same criteria to
recognize the speculative sentences and conse-
quently we re-annotated the BioScope corpus
according to the criteria of BioExcom. One
other difference is that the source used for lin-
guistic resources and rules of BioExcom is
completely different from the source of the
corpus used for the evaluation, aside from the
studies using directly BioScope like Morante
and Daelemans (2009) or Özgur and Radev
(2009). Nevertheless, considering that there are

Our aim was to test on a large scale (the ma-
nually annotated BioScope corpus) the rule
based system BioExcom that automatically
annotates speculations in biomedical papers.
We observed an important disagreement be-
tween the two annotations and as a result,
treated it manually. We put forward three
principal reasons for the differences in annota-
tion:
. The lack of certain linguistic markers in
BioExcom (false negative): some of them have
to be added in the system (for example “seem”
or “it appears”). Some other markers are too
ambiguous to be relevant (for example “could”
without a positive clue).
. An error in the annotation of BioExcom or in
BioScope (false positives): this is relatively
rare, especially for BioExcom, which favors
the Precision.
. The difference of criteria used to determine
whether a sentence is speculative or not: this is
the main reason and we discuss it hereafter.
Obtaining a good manual annotation is a
recurrent problem in semantic annotation
(Uren et al., 2006) and some studies have stu-
died the disagreement in human judgment (Ve-
ronis, 1998). This phenomenon is undoubtedly
found here since Szarvas et al. (2008) and
Desclés et al. (2009) have reported the difficul-
ty even for experts to detect speculations. But
the disagreement between BioExcom and Bi-
oScope has to be seen almost as a conflict con-
cerning the meaning given to the word “specu-
lation” and if we agree on its definition, we
demonstrated the efficiency of BioExcom.
Indeed, in order to provide good tools to
biologists, computational linguists seek to ex-
tract only definite statements and consequently
try to remove or to present separately hedging.
Some of them have also tried to indicate the
degree of uncertainty, in order to better charac-
terize hedging. Despite the promising use of
weighting of hedging cues (Kilicoglu and
Bergler, 2008), the task of determining the
strength of speculation appears to be difficult,
even for biologists (Light et al., 2004). In
another hand biologists can also consider spec-
ulation as a source of knowledge (for example,
Thompson et al. (2008) categorize speculation
as a type of knowledge), giving actual trends,
new ideas and hypothesis useful for them. In
this view, BioExcom extracts them according
to more restrictive criteria and categorizes
them into “prior” and “new” in order to better
highlight speculations. Knowing the new spec-
ulations of a paper can reveal some of the real
new output of it and so help to decide which
paper is worth spending time. The categoriza-
tion into prior speculation highlights the emer-
gence of an idea which is taken into considera-
tion by the scientific community and thus can
also, at least partially, give an indication of its
importance among the huge amount of specu-
lations in the literature.
The availability of the corpora (raw BioEx-
com annotations and re-annotations of BioS-
cope according to these criteria) could help to
better take into account these views. In particu-
lar, these corpora will be useful to improve the
rules of BioExcom for detecting speculations.
And many of the other sentences belonging to
hedging and discarded during the re-annotation
process (previously annotated or not in BioS-
cope) will serve to develop other semantic cat-
egories such as demonstration/conclusion or
deduction.

Özgur and Radev (2009) built also a system that detects speculations and their scopes in biomedical scientific texts. They performed a supervised classification task, where they classified the potential keywords as real speculation keywords or not by using a diverse set of linguistic features that represent the contexts of the keywords. They obtained F-Measure of 92% for the scientific abstracts (10-fold cross-validation experiments). The F-Measure for Full Text Papers (leave-one-out-cross-validation) was 83%. 3 BioExcom EXCOM2 (Djioua et al., 2006; Alrahabi, 2010) is a rule-based system using the computational principles of the Contextual Exploration processing (Desclés, 2006). EXCOM does not need any morpho-syntactic analysis and only requires one pre-treatment step of corpus segmentation into segments (which are sentences or sometimes clauses according to the punctuation) (Figure 1). EXCOM uses declarative rules built by linguists or domain experts and based on the search for linguistic markers in the text. The latter are hierarchically organized 2 http://www.excom.fr/ into the rules: they are either indicators (strong markers) or clues (complementar</context>

The latter is in this case more restrictive than previously, and close to the notion of hypothesis and uncertain proposal. This interest of biologists can be explained by different reasons. Firstly, since speculations give meaning to results, they sometimes carry more useful information than factual sentences. In addition, speculative sentences emphasize important data, which can be very useful in data-collection papers (genomic and post-genomic papers, see (Brent and Lok, 2005)). Finally, speculations can also give current trends or directions, by enabling the researchers to anticipate future experimental discoveries, or by suggesting other ways to envision biological problems and giving new ideas for future experiments (Blagosklonny and Pardee, 2002).

In particular, the corpus consists of 9 full texts papers (five papers from the FlyBase dataset and four papers from the journal BMC Bioinformatics), and 1273 abstracts (from the Genia Corpus (Collier et al., 1999)).

Since BioExcom has obtained good results for detecting speculations but in a relatively small scale evaluation, it seems useful to test this tool on a large, unknown corpus like BioScope. Furthermore, it is important to compare in greater detail these two different approaches to characterize speculative sentences and see more precisely in what they differ. We performed an automatic annotation of the BioScope corpus by BioExcom and we measured raw performance.

If all the examined conditions of a rule are satisfied, EXCOM attributes the corresponding annotation to the designated segment. Generally the indicators are interconnected into graphs called “semantic maps” (Alrahabi and Desclés, 2008). EXCOM has been used for various tasks such as automatic summarization, relationships between concepts, categorization of bibliographic citations and reported speech. BioExcom is the system that uses the annotation performed by EXCOM thanks to specific linguistic resources built for detecting speculations in biomedical papers (Desclés et al., 2009). Furthermore, BioExcom performs an indexation of the annotated segments in order to provide the possibility of searching for 34 specific terms. The rules used for the annotation processing are based on a precise semantic analysis of the multiple ways to express speculation performed by an expert in about seventy biological papers. BioExcom also categorizes speculative segments into “new speculation” (speculative sentences presented for the first time in the paper or not explicitly presented as prior speculation) and “prior speculation” (speculative sentences cited in the paper, but presented </context>

For the same reason, BioExcom extracts speculation without taking into account whether this speculation is denied or not. (3) The rescue of the D-mib mutant phenotype by ectopic expression of Neur strongly supports this interpretation At present, the evaluation process of BioExcom has only been performed on a relatively small scale (2 full-text papers read by five experts and containing 59 speculative sentences in total) and after the automatic annotation process (Desclés et al., 2009). Promising results have been reported for BioExcom in detecting speculations, by providing a high Precision of 98,3%, and a Recall of 95,1% (FMeasure of 96,7%). This rate is consistent with the goal of BioExcom to be a monitoring and decision support tool. 35 4 Raw evaluation The Bioscope corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008) consists of three parts; namely medical free texts, biological full papers and biological scientific abstracts. However in this test, we only used two parts of the Bioscope corpus (full papers and abstracts) because we were preferentially interested in the biomedical scientific </context>

As a result of this processing, BioExcom automatically extracted 341 segments from the Full Text Papers Corpus and 1489 segments from the Abstract Corpus (1830 segments in total)4. We could then compare our output files with the Bioscope Corpus which contained manual annotations. In this task we do not consider the categorization of BioExcom (“new speculation” and “prior speculation”) and these annotated sentences are only considered as speculative. Thus, we obtained the results presented in Table 1. Consistent with the previous evaluation performed on BioExcom (Desclés et al., 2009), the Precision is high (approximately 93% in average, calculated from the total of segments of the two corpora). Nevertheless, the Recall dramatically falls to approximately 68% (in average) compared to the first evaluation (Recall of 93%).

Finally, based on these results, we decided to recalculate the Precision, Recall and FMeasure to be more in agreement with the notion of speculation as it has been described by Desclés et al. (2009) (last lines in Tables 2 and 3). Corrected Precision, Recall and F-Measure are respectively around 99%, 83% and 90% (averages calculated from the total of segments of the two corpora). These results are close to the first evaluation performed by Desclés et al. (2009), even if Recall is still lower than previously. Obviously, our results are not directly comparable with the prior studies because BioExcom does not use exactly the same criteria to recognize the speculative sentences and consequently we re-annotated the BioScope corpus according to the criteria of BioExcom.

An error in the annotation of BioExcom or in BioScope (false positives): this is relatively rare, especially for BioExcom, which favors the Precision. . The difference of criteria used to determine whether a sentence is speculative or not: this is the main reason and we discuss it hereafter. Obtaining a good manual annotation is a recurrent problem in semantic annotation (Uren et al., 2006) and some studies have studied the disagreement in human judgment (Veronis, 1998). This phenomenon is undoubtedly found here since Szarvas et al. (2008) and Desclés et al. (2009) have reported the difficulty even for experts to detect speculations. But the disagreement between BioExcom and BioScope has to be seen almost as a conflict concerning the meaning given to the word “speculation” and if we agree on its definition, we demonstrated the efficiency of BioExcom. Indeed, in order to provide good tools to biologists, computational linguists seek to extract only definite statements and consequently try to remove or to present separately hedging.

Indeed, because biologists are almost interested in knowing only factual statements, the information extraction tools have to remove all uncertain statements, identified as hedging or speculation, or at least to present them separately from definite results. Consequently, the vast majority of Natural Language Processing tools dealing with the identification of speculation have followed this very large meaning of the word “speculation”, in order to avoid extracting uncertain information as factual information (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2008; Medlock, 2008; Szarvas, 2008; Morante and Daelemans, 2009; Özgur and Radev, 2009). To help improve the information extraction tools, a corpus, called BioScope, has been annotated for speculation, negation and its linguistic scopes in biomedical texts (Szarvas et al., 2008).

Svarzas (2008) managed to devise a hedge classification in biomedical texts based on a weakly supervised selection of keywords. To evaluate their system, they manually annotated four papers of BMC Bioinformatics with the same criteria as Medlock and Briscone (2007). They obtained an F-Measure of 85% on the FlyBase dataset and an F-Measure of 75% on the BMC Bioinformatics dataset, when the training was carried out with the FlyBase dataset, demonstrating that the probability of their hedge classifiers is limited. To recognize speculative sentences, Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) also used speculative keywords from prior linguistic work and expanded them by WordNet, UMLS Specialist Lexicon, and by introducing syntactic patterns. In order to determine the speculative strength of sentences, they assigned speculative cues to weights in two methods. They worked on the two publicly available corpora, obtaining an FMeasure of 85% on the FlyBase data set and an F-Measure of 82% on the BMC Bioinformatics data.

By doing so, we demonstrate the efficiency of BioExcom to extract these types of speculations and we argue the importance of this tool for biologists, who are also interested in finding hypotheses. 1 Introduction In one of the first studies about biological speculations in Natural Language Processing, Light et al. (2004) have reported that biologists can have a dual posture concerning this subject: “In the context of information retrieval, an example information need might be `I am looking for speculations about the X gene in liver tissue.” One of the authors spoke at a research department of a drug company and the biologists present expressed this sort of information need. On the other hand, one of the authors has also encountered the opposite need: `I am looking for definite statements about transcription factors that interact with NF Kappa B.” Both these information needs would be easier to fulfill if auto</context>

Consequently, the vast majority of Natural Language Processing tools dealing with the identification of speculation have followed this very large meaning of the word “speculation”, in order to avoid extracting uncertain information as factual information (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2008; Medlock, 2008; Szarvas, 2008; Morante and Daelemans, 2009; Özgur and Radev, 2009). To help improve the information extraction tools, a corpus, called BioScope, has been annotated for speculation, negation and its linguistic scopes in biomedical texts (Szarvas et al., 2008). However, when a biologist says he is interested in knowing all speculations about a biological entity (gene or protein for example) or a biological process, this claim concerns another meaning of the word “speculation”. The latter is in this case more restrictive than previously, and close to the notion of hypothesis and uncertain proposal. This interest of biologists can be explained by different reasons. Firstly, since speculations give meaning to results, they sometimes carry more useful information than factual sentences. In addition, speculative sentences emphasize important data, which</context>
<context position="8449" citStr="Szarvas et al., 2008" startWordPosition="1316" endWordPosition="1319">and Bergler (2008) also used speculative keywords from prior linguistic work and expanded them by WordNet, UMLS Specialist Lexicon, and by introducing syntactic patterns. In order to determine the speculative strength of sentences, they assigned speculative cues to weights in two methods. They worked on the two publicly available corpora, obtaining an FMeasure of 85% on the FlyBase data set and an F-Measure of 82% on the BMC Bioinformatics data. The BioScope corpus is a manually annotated corpus for speculation and negation keywords (token level), and their linguistic scopes (sentence level) (Szarvas et al., 2008). This corpus is publicly available1 and the annotation 1 http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/rgai/bioscope 33 process has been performed by two independent annotators and a chief linguist. In particular, the corpus consists of 9 full texts papers (five papers from the FlyBase dataset and four papers from the journal BMC Bioinformatics), and 1273 abstracts (from the Genia Corpus (Collier et al., 1999)). The annotation guidelines are provided and speculation is identified to uncertainty and hedging. However the criteria used here are not detailed very accurately, unlike the detailed work of Medlock and </context>
<context position="15877" citStr="Szarvas et al., 2008" startWordPosition="2484" endWordPosition="2487">of Neur strongly supports this interpretation At present, the evaluation process of BioExcom has only been performed on a relatively small scale (2 full-text papers read by five experts and containing 59 speculative sentences in total) and after the automatic annotation process (Desclés et al., 2009). Promising results have been reported for BioExcom in detecting speculations, by providing a high Precision of 98,3%, and a Recall of 95,1% (FMeasure of 96,7%). This rate is consistent with the goal of BioExcom to be a monitoring and decision support tool. 35 4 Raw evaluation The Bioscope corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008) consists of three parts; namely medical free texts, biological full papers and biological scientific abstracts. However in this test, we only used two parts of the Bioscope corpus (full papers and abstracts) because we were preferentially interested in the biomedical scientific domain. First, we cleaned the corpus from all element tags (angled brackets marking hedge keywords and parentheses marking scopes) and saved these documents into text files. The latter could then be automatically segmented into sentences or clauses and semantically annotated by BioExcom. As a result of this processing,</context>
<context position="29356" citStr="Szarvas et al. (2008)" startWordPosition="4649" endWordPosition="4652">o ambiguous to be relevant (for example “could” without a positive clue). . An error in the annotation of BioExcom or in BioScope (false positives): this is relatively rare, especially for BioExcom, which favors the Precision. . The difference of criteria used to determine whether a sentence is speculative or not: this is the main reason and we discuss it hereafter. Obtaining a good manual annotation is a recurrent problem in semantic annotation (Uren et al., 2006) and some studies have studied the disagreement in human judgment (Veronis, 1998). This phenomenon is undoubtedly found here since Szarvas et al. (2008) and Desclés et al. (2009) have reported the difficulty even for experts to detect speculations. But the disagreement between BioExcom and BioScope has to be seen almost as a conflict concerning the meaning given to the word “speculation” and if we agree on its definition, we demonstrated the efficiency of BioExcom. Indeed, in order to provide good tools to biologists, computational linguists seek to extract only definite statements and consequently try to remove or to present separately hedging. Some of them have also tried to indicate the degree of uncertainty, in order to better characteriz</context>

Although these sentences correspond to hedging as it has been defined by Hyland (1995), we argue that the sentences (9-10) can be characterized more as a demonstration or a deduction with the expressions “indicate that” and “it can be deduced” than a speculation. According to the criteria used for establishing BioExcom rules, these sentences do not correspond to a speculation because they present things more or less as certain (see also (Thompson et al., 2008)). In this view, the case of “indicate that” is interesting to be detailed. Whereas many studies use it as a linguistic marker of speculation, Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) recently moderated its speculative meaning by highlighting the additional need to take into account its context. The linguistic analysis used to establish the rules in BioExcom is much more restrictive and does not consider it as a marker. It should also be mentioned that we noticed a few sentences which were incorrectly annotated in BioScope as speculation. Thus, the sentence (11) is rather, in our opinion, a definite state</context>

Indeed, in order to provide good tools to biologists, computational linguists seek to extract only definite statements and consequently try to remove or to present separately hedging. Some of them have also tried to indicate the degree of uncertainty, in order to better characterize hedging. Despite the promising use of weighting of hedging cues (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2008), the task of determining the strength of speculation appears to be difficult, even for biologists (Light et al., 2004). In another hand biologists can also consider speculation as a source of knowledge (for example, Thompson et al. (2008) categorize speculation as a type of knowledge), giving actual trends, new ideas and hypothesis useful for them. In this view, BioExcom extracts them according to more restrictive criteria and categorizes them into “prior” and “new” in order to better highlight speculations. Knowing the new speculations of a paper can reveal some of the real new output of it and so help to decide which paper is worth spending time. The categorization into prior speculation highlights the emergence of an idea which is taken into consideration by the scientific community and thus can also, at least partially, gi</context>
