This paper describes a new kind of seman-
tic annotation in parallel treebanks. We
build French-German parallel treebanks of
mountaineering reports, a text genre that
abounds with geographical names which
we classify and ground with reference to
a large gazetteer of Swiss toponyms. We
discuss the challenges in obtaining a high
recall and precision in automatic ground-
ing, and sketch how we represent the
grounding information in our treebank.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999055">
Treebanks have become valuable resources in nat-
ural language processing as training corpora for
natural language parsers, as repositories for lin-
guistic research, or as evaluation corpora for dif-
ferent NLP systems. We define a treebank as
a collection of syntactically annotated sentences.
The annotation can vary from constituent to de-
pendency or tecto-grammatical structures. The
term treebank is mostly used to denote manually
checked collections, but recently it has been ex-
tended to also refer to automatically parsed cor-
pora.
We have built manually checked treebanks for
various text genres (see section 3): economy texts,
a popular science philosophy novel, and technical
user manuals. We are now entering a new genre,
mountaineering reports, with the goal to link tex-
tual to spatial information. We build French and
German treebanks of translated texts from the
Swiss Alpine Club. This genre contains a multi-
tude of geographical names (e.g. mountains and
valleys, glaciers and rivers). Therefore we need to
include the identification and grounding of these
toponyms as part of the annotation process.
In this paper we first describe our corpus of
alpine texts, then our work on creating paral-
lel treebanks which includes aligning the parallel
trees on word and phrase level. We sketch the dif-
ficulties in disambiguating the toponyms and de-
scribe our integration of the toponym identifiers as
a special kind of semantic annotation in the tree-
bank.

<bodyText confidence="0.999844761904762">
In our project Text+Berg1 we digitize alpine her-
itage literature from various European countries.
Currently our group digitizes all yearbooks of the
Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) from 1864 until today.
Each yearbook consists of 300 to 600 pages and
contains reports on mountain expeditions, culture
of mountain peoples, as well as the flora, fauna
and geology of the mountains.
The corpus preparation presented interesting
challenges in automatic OCR correction, language
identification, and text structure recognition which
we have described in (Volk et al., 2010).
As of March 2010 we have scanned and OCR-
converted 142 books from 1864 to 1982, corre-
sponding to nearly 70,000 pages. This resulted in
a multilingual corpus of 6101 articles in German,
2659 in French, 155 in Italian, 13 in Romansch,
and 3 in Swiss-German. The parallel part of our
corpus currently contains 701 translated articles
amounting to 2.6 million tokens in French and 2.3
million tokens in German.

In recent years the combined research on tree-
banks and parallel corpora has led to parallel tree-
banks. We have built a parallel treebank (En-
glish, German, Swedish) which contains 1500 sen-
tences in three languages: 500 sentences each
from Jostein Gaarder’s novel “Sophie’s World”,
from economy texts (e.g. business reports from
mechanical engineering company ABB and from
the bank SEB), and from a technical manual with

We have annotated the English sentences
according to the well-established Penn Tree-
bank guidelines. For German we followed the
TIGER annotation guidelines, and we adapted
these guidelines also for Swedish (see (Volk
and Samuelsson, 2004)). For French treebank-
ing we are looking for inspiration from the Le
Monde treebank (Abeill´e et al., 2003) and from
L’Arboratoire (Bick, 2010). The Le Monde tree-
bank is a constituent structure treebank partially
annotated with functional labels. L’Arboratoire is
based on constraint grammar analysis but can also
output constituent trees.

3.1 Our Tree Alignment Tool
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987703703704">
After finishing the monolingual trees we aligned
them on the word level and phrase level. For
this purpose we have developed the TreeAligner
(Lundborg et al., 2007). This program comes with
a graphical user interface to insert or modify align-
ments between pairs of syntax trees.2
The TreeAligner displays tree pairs with the
trees in mirror orientation (one top-up and one top-
down). This has the advantage that the alignment
lines cross fewer parts of the lower tree. Figure 1
shows an example of a tree pair with alignment
lines. The lines denote translation equivalence.
Both trees are constituent structure trees, but the
edge labels contain function labels (like subject,
object, attribute) which can be used to easily con-
vert the trees to dependency structures (cf. (Marek
et al., 2009)).
Recently we have extended the TreeAligner’s
functionality from being solely an alignment tool
to also being a powerful search tool over parallel
treebanks (Volk et al., 2007; Marek et al., 2008).
This enables our annotators to improve the align-
ment quality by cross-checking previous align-
ments. This functionality makes the TreeAligner
also attractive to a wider user base (e.g. linguists,
translation scientists) who are interested in search-
ing rather than building parallel treebanks.

(2003) have built a parallel treebank for the spe-
cific purpose of machine translation, the Czech-
English Penn Treebank with tecto-grammatical
dependency trees. Other parallel treebank projects
include Croco (Hansen-Schirra et al., 2006) which
is aimed at building a English-German tree-
bank for translation studies, LinES an English-
Swedish parallel treebank (Ahrenberg, 2007), and
the English-French HomeCentre treebank (Hearne
and Way, 2006), a hand-crafted parallel treebank
consisting of 810 sentence pairs from a Xerox
printer manual.
Some researchers have tried to exploit parallel
treebanks for example-based or statistical machine
translation (Tinsley et al., 2009). Since manually
created treebanks are too small for this purpose,
various researchers have worked on automatically
parsing and aligning parallel treebanks. Zhechev
(2009) and Tiedemann and Kotz´e (2009) have
presented methods for automatic cross-language
phrase alignment.
There have been various attempts to enrich
treebanks with semantic information. For exam-
ple, the Propbank project has assigned semantic
roles to Penn treebank sentences (Kingsbury et al.,
2002). Likewise the SALSA project has added
frame-semantic annotations on top of syntax trees
from the German TIGER treebank (Burchardt et
al., 2006). Frame-semantics was extended to par-
allel treebanks by (Pad´o, 2007) and (Volk and
Samuelsson, 2007). To our knowledge a treebank
with grounded toponym information has not been
created yet.

Named entity recognition is an important aspect of
information extraction. But it has also been recog-
nized as important for the access to heritage data.
In a previous project we have investigated meth-
ods for named entity recognition in newspaper
texts (Volk and Clematide, 2001). In that work
we had only distinguished two types of geograph-
ical names: city names and country names. This
was sufficient for texts that dealt mostly with facts
like a company being located in a certain coun-
try or having started business in a certain city.
In contrast to that, our alpine text corpus deals
with much more fine-grained location informa-
tion: mountains and valleys, glaciers and climb-
ing routes, cabins and hotels, rivers and lakes. In
fact the description of movements (e.g. in moun-

How many mountain names have we missed
to identify? A manual inspection showed that
there are another 92 mountain names (35 differ-
ent mountain names) missing. So recall of the
naive exact matching is below 40% despite the
large gazetteer. We have reported on a number of
reasons for missed names in (Volk et al., 2010).
We found that spelling variations and partial co-
references account for the majority of recall prob-
lems. In addition we need to disambiguate be-
tween name-noun and name-name homographs.
This leaves the issue on how to represent the geo-
tagging information in our treebank.

Named entity classification can be divided into
name recognition, disambiguation and grounding.
The first two steps are applicable to all kinds of
names. The final step of grounding the names is
different depending on the name types. A per-
son name may be grounded by refering to the per-
son’s Wikipedia page. The same could be done
for a geographical name. The obvious disadvan-
tage are changing URLs and missing Wikipedia
pages. The goal of grounding must be to link
the name to the most stable and most reliable
“ground”. Therefore toponyms are often linked to
their geographical coordinates. We have chosen to
link the toponyms from our alpine texts to unique
identifiers in the SwissTopo database. This works
well for Swiss names and particularly well for par-
allel French-German sentence pairs. The cross-
language alignment assures that the names are rec-
ognized in either language and the classification
information can then automatically be transfered
to the other language.
In our example in figure 1, the mountain name
“Monte Rosa” is listed in SwissTopo with its al-
titude (4633 m) and its location close to Zermatt.
Since “Zermatt” itself occurs in the sentence, this
is strong evidence that we have identified the cor-
rect mountain, and we will attach its SwissTopo
identification number in our treebank. Technically
this means we add a reference to the gazetteer and
to the identifier within the gazetteer into the XML
representation of the linguistic object.
In our German example sentence “Monte Rosa”
is annotated as a proper name (PN). This occur-
rence is phrase 502 in sentence 311 of our tree-
bank. The grounding id (g id) is taken from Swis-
sTopo which then allows us to access the geo-
graphical coordinates, the altitude and neighbor-
hood information.
&lt;nt id=&amp;quot;s311_502&amp;quot;
cat=&amp;quot;PN&amp;quot;
g_source=&amp;quot;SwissTopo&amp;quot;
g_id=&amp;quot;7355873&amp;quot; &gt;
Instead of integrating the grounding pointers di-
rectly in the XML file of the treebank, it is possible
to use stand-off annotation by connecting the iden-
tifier of the geo-name with the identifier from the
gazetteer in a separate file.
The alignments in our parallel treebank lead
to the advantage that the grounding information
needs to be saved only once. In our example, the
corresponding mountain name “Mont Rose” in the
French translation is listed in SwissTopo only as a
building in the municipality of Genthod in the can-
ton Geneva. Since we have strong evidence from
the German sentence, we can rule out this option.
Zermatt itself occurs in both the French and
German sentences in our example. It is listed in
SwissTopo with its altitude (1616 m) and classi-
fied as mid-sized municipality (2000 to 10,000 in-
habitants). Zermatt is a unique name in SwissTopo
and therefore is grounded via its SwissTopo identi-
fier. Likewise we ground “Schwarzberg Weisstor”
(spelled without hyphen in SwissTopo) which is
listed as foot pass in the municipality of Saas-
Almagell. In case of doubt we could verify
that Saas-Almagell and Zermatt are neighboring
towns, which indeed they are.

Grounding toponyms in parallel treebanks repre-
sents a new kind of semantic annotation. We have
sketched the issues in automatic toponym classi-
fication and disambiguation. We are working on
a French-German parallel treebank of alpine texts
which contain a multitude of toponyms that de-
scribe way-points on climbing or hiking routes but
also panorama views. We are interested in iden-
tifying all toponyms in order to enable treebank
access via geographical maps. In the future we
want to automatically compute and display climb-
ing routes from the textual descriptions. The an-
notated treebank will then serve as a gold standard
for the evaluation of the automatic geo-tagging.

Currently our group digitizes all yearbooks of the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) from 1864 until today. Each yearbook consists of 300 to 600 pages and contains reports on mountain expeditions, culture of mountain peoples, as well as the flora, fauna and geology of the mountains. The corpus preparation presented interesting challenges in automatic OCR correction, language identification, and text structure recognition which we have described in (Volk et al., 2010). As of March 2010 we have scanned and OCRconverted 142 books from 1864 to 1982, corresponding to nearly 70,000 pages. This resulted in a multilingual corpus of 6101 articles in German, 2659 in French, 155 in Italian, 13 in Romansch, and 3 in Swiss-German. The parallel part of our corpus currently contains 701 translated articles amounting to 2.6 million tokens in French and 2.3 million tokens in German. 3 Parallel Treebanks In recent years the combined research on treebanks and parallel corpora has led to parallel treebanks. We have built a parallel treebank (English, German, Swedish) which c</context>

How many mountain names have we missed to identify? A manual inspection showed that there are another 92 mountain names (35 different mountain names) missing. So recall of the naive exact matching is below 40% despite the large gazetteer. We have reported on a number of reasons for missed names in (Volk et al., 2010). We found that spelling variations and partial coreferences account for the majority of recall problems. In addition we need to disambiguate between name-noun and name-name homographs. This leaves the issue on how to represent the geotagging information in our treebank. 5 Geonames in TYeebanks Named entity classification can be divided into name recognition, disambiguation and grounding. The first two steps are applicable to all kinds of names. The final step of grounding the names is different depending on the name types.

Some researchers have tried to exploit parallel treebanks for example-based or statistical machine translation (Tinsley et al., 2009). Since manually created treebanks are too small for this purpose, various researchers have worked on automatically parsing and aligning parallel treebanks. Zhechev (2009) and Tiedemann and Kotz´e (2009) have presented methods for automatic cross-language phrase alignment. There have been various attempts to enrich treebanks with semantic information. For example, the Propbank project has assigned semantic roles to Penn treebank sentences (Kingsbury et al., 2002). Likewise the SALSA project has added frame-semantic annotations on top of syntax trees from the German TIGER treebank (Burchardt et al., 2006). Frame-semantics was extended to parallel treebanks by (Pad´o, 2007) and (Volk and Samuelsson, 2007). To our knowledge a treebank with grounded toponym informa</context>
