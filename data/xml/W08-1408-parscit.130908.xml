Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999935333333333">
The Europe Media Monitor system
(EMM) gathers and aggregates an aver-
age of 50,000 newspaper articles per day
in over 40 languages. To manage the in-
formation overflow, it was decided to
group similar articles per day and per
language into clusters and to link daily
clusters over time into stories. A story
automatically comes into existence when
related groups of articles occur within a
7-day window. While cross-lingual links
across 19 languages for individual news
clusters have been displayed since 2004
as part of a freely accessible online appli-
cation (http://press.jrc.it/NewsExplorer),
the newest development is work on link-
ing entire stories across languages. The
evaluation of the monolingual aggrega-
tion of historical clusters into stories and
of the linking of stories across languages
yielded mostly satisfying results.

<bodyText confidence="0.999940666666667">
Large amounts of information are published
daily on news web portals around the world. Pre-
senting the most important news on simple,
newspaper-like pages is enough when the user
wants to be informed about the latest news.
However, such websites do not provide a long-
term view on how any given story or event de-
veloped over time. Our objective is to provide
users with a fully automatic tool that groups in-
dividual news articles every day into clusters of
related news and to aggregate the daily clusters
into stories, by linking them to the related ones

identified in the previous weeks and months. In
our jargon, stories are thus groups of articles
talking about a similar event or theme over time.
We work with the daily clusters computed by the
NewsExplorer application (Pouliquen et al.
2004). For each daily cluster in currently nine-
teen languages, the similarity to all clusters pro-
duced during the previous seven days is com-
puted and a link is established if the similarity is
above a certain threshold. It is on the basis of
these individual links that stories are built, i.e.
longer chains of news clusters related over time.
The current NewsExplorer application addition-
ally identifies for all news clusters, whether there
are related clusters in the other languages. These
daily cross-lingual links are used to link the
longer-lasting stories across languages.
After a review of related work (Section 1 2),
we will present the Europe Media Monitor
(EMM) system and its NewsExplorer application
(section 3). We will then provide details on the
process to build the multi-monolingual stories
(Section 4) and on the more recent work on link-
ing stories across languages (Section 5). Sec-
tion 6 presents evaluation results both for the
monolingual story compilation and for the estab-
lishment of cross-lingual links. Section 7 con-
cludes and points to future work.

The presented work falls into the two fields of
Topic Detection and Tracking and cross-lingual
document similarity calculation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990449">
2.1 Topic detection and tracking (TDT)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903571428571">
TDT was promoted and meticulously defined by
the US-American DARPA programme (see
Wayne 2000). An example explaining the TDT
concept was that of the Oklahoma City bombing
in 1995, where not only the bombing, but also
the related memorial services, investigations,
prosecution etc. were supposed to be captured.

Human evaluators will often differ in their opin-
ion whether a given document belongs to a topic
or not, especially as ‘topic’ can be defined
broadly (e.g. the Iraq war and the following pe-
riod of insurgence) or more specifically. For in-
stance, the capture and prosecution of Saddam
Hussein, individual roadside bombings and air
strikes, or the killing of Al Qaeda leader Abu
Musab al-Zarqawi could either be seen as indi-
vidual topics or as part of the Iraq war. This
fuzziness regarding what is a ‘topic’ makes a
formal evaluation rather difficult. Our system is
more inclusive and will thus include all the men-
tioned sub-events into one topic (story). A sepa-
rate clustering system was developed as part of
the EMM-NewsBrief (http://press.jrc.it/NewsBrief/),
which produces more short-lived and thus more
specific historical cluster links.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998679">
2.2 Cross-lingual linking of documents
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909706666667">
Since 2000, the TDT task was part of the TIDES
programme (Translingual Information Detection,
Extraction and Summarisation), which focused
on cross-lingual information access. The goal of
TIDES was to enable English-speaking users to
access, correlate and interpret multilingual
sources of real-time information and to share the
essence of this information with collaborators.
The purpose of our own work includes the topic
detection and tracking as well as the cross-
lingual aspect. Main differences between our
own work and TIDES are that we need to moni-
tor more languages, that we are interested in all
cross-lingual links (as opposed to targeting only
English), and that we use different methods to
establish cross-lingual links (see Section 5).
All TDT and TIDES participants used either
Machine Translation (MT; e.g. Leek et al. 1999)
or bilingual dictionaries (e.g. Wactlar 1999) for
the cross-lingual tasks. Performance was always
lower for cross-lingual topic tracking (Wayne
2000). An interesting insight was formulated in
the “native language hypothesis” by Larkey et al
(2004), which states that topic tracking works
better in the original language than in (ma-
chine-)translated collections. Various partici-
pants stated that the usage of named entities
helped (Wayne 2000). Taking these insights into
account, we always work in the source language
and make intensive use of named entities.
Outside TDT, an additional two approaches
for linking related documents across languages
have been proposed, both of which use bilingual
vector space models: Landauer &amp; Littman (1991)
used bilingual Lexical Semantic Analysis and Vi-
nokourov et al. (2002) used Kernel Canonical
Correlation Analysis. These and the approaches
using MT or bilingual dictionaries have in com-
mon that they require bilingual resources and are
thus not easily scalable for many language pairs.
For N languages, there are N*(N-1)/2 language
pairs (e.g. for 20 languages, there are 190 lan-
guage pairs and 380 language pair directions).
Due to the multilinguality requirement in the
European Union (EU) context (there are 23 offi-
cial EU languages as of 2007), Steinberger et al.
(2004) proposed to produce an interlingual docu-
ment (or document cluster) representation based
on named entities (persons, organisations, disam-
biguated locations), units of measurement, multi-
lingual specialist taxonomies (e.g. medicine),
thesauri and other similar resources that may help
produce a language-independent document repre-
sentation. Similarly to Steinberger et al. (2004),
the work described in the following sections
equally goes beyond the language pair-specific
approach, but it does not make use of the whole
range of information types.
In Pouliquen et al. (2004), we showed how
NewsExplorer links individual news clusters
over time and across languages, but without ag-
gregating the clusters into the more compact and
high-level representations (which we call sto-
ries). This new level of abstraction was achieved
by exploiting the monolingual and cross-lingual
cluster links and by adding additional filtering
heuristics to eliminate wrong story candidate
clusters. As a result, long-term developments can
now be visualised in timelines and users can ex-
plore the development of events over long time
periods (see Section 4.2). Additionally, meta-
information for each story can be compiled
automatically, including article and cluster statis-
tics as well as lists of named entities associated
to a given story.

<bodyText confidence="0.999993222222222">
EMM has been gathering multilingual news arti-
cles from many different web portals since 2002.
It’s NewsBrief application has since displayed
the world’s most recent news items on its public
web servers (http://emm.jrc.it/overview.html).
Every day, and for each of 19 languages sepa-
rately, EMM’s NewsExplorer application groups
related articles into clusters. Clusters are com-
puted using a group average agglomerative bot-
tom-up clustering algorithm (similar to Schultz
&amp; Liberman 1999). Each article is represented as
a vector of keywords with the keywords being
the words of the text (except stop words) and
their weight being the log-likelihood value com-
puted using word frequency lists based on sev-
eral years of news. We additionally enrich the
vector space representation of each cluster with
country information (see Pouliquen et al., 2004),
based on log-likelihood-weighted, automatically
recognised and disambiguated location and coun-
try names (see Pouliquen et al. 2006).
Each computed daily cluster consists of its
keywords (i.e. the average log-likelihood weight
for each word) and the title of the cluster’s me-
doid (i.e. the article closest to the centroid of the
cluster). In addition we enrich the cluster with
features that will be used in further processes.
These include the cluster size, lists of persons,
organisations, geo-locations and subject domain
codes (see Section 5).
When comparing two clusters in the same lan-
guage, the keywords offer a good representation
(especially when the keywords are enriched with
the country information). Section 5 will show
that the additional ingredients are useful to com-
pare two clusters in different languages.

4 Building stories enriched with meta-
information
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9735248">
For each language separately and for each individ-
ual cluster of the day, we compute the cosine simi-
larity with all clusters of the past 7 days (see Fig-
ure 1). Similarity is based on the keywords associ-
ated with each cluster. If the similarity between the
keyword vectors of two clusters is above the em-
pirically derived threshold of 0.5, clusters are
linked. This optimised threshold was established by
evaluating cluster linking in several languages (see
Pouliquen et al. 2004). A cluster can be linked to
several previous clusters, and it can even be linked
to two different clusters of the same day.
4.1 Building stories by linking clusters over
time
Stories are composed of several clusters. If a new
cluster is similar to clusters that are part of a
story, it is likely that this new cluster is a con-
tinuation of the existing story. For the purpose of
building stories, individual and yet unlinked clus-
ters of the previous seven days are treated like
(single cluster) stories. If clusters have not been
linked to within seven days, they remain individ-
ual clusters that are not part of a story. Building
stories out of clusters is done using the following
incremental algorithm (for a given day):
</bodyText>

with sim(cp,s) being the similarity of the cluster
to the story (the first cluster of a story gets a sim
of 1, the following depend on the score com-
puted by the algorithm).
When deciding whether a new cluster should
be part of an existing story, the challenge is to
combine the similarities of the new cluster with
each of the clusters in the story. As stories
change over time and the purpose is to link the
newest events to existing stories, the new cluster
is only compared to the story’s clusters of the last
7 days. A seven-day window is intuitive and
automatically takes care of fluctuations regarding
the number of articles during the week (week-
ends are quieter). In the algorithm to determine
whether the new cluster is linked to the story, the
similarity score is computed incrementally: The
score is the similarity of the new cluster with the
latest cluster of the story (typically yesterday’s)
plus the similarity of the new cluster with the
story’s cluster of the day before multiplied with a
reducing factor (1-scorei-1), plus the similarity of
the new cluster with the story’s cluster of yet an-
other day before multiplied with a reducing fac-
tor (1-scorei-2), etc. The reducing factor helps to
keep the similarity score between the theoretical
values 0 (unrelated) and 1 (highly related):
If the final score is above the threshold of 0.5,
the cluster gets linked to the existing story.
Otherwise it remains unlinked. The story building
algorithm is language-independent and could thus
be applied to all of the 19 NewsExplorer lan-
guages. Currently, it is run every day (in
sequential order) in the following nine languages:
Dutch, English, French, German, Italian,
Portuguese, Slovene, Spanish and Swedish.
Out of the daily average of 970 new clusters
(average computed for all nine languages over a
period of one month), only 281 get linked to an
existing story (29%) and 90 contribute to a new
story (9%). The remaining 599 clusters (62%)
remain unlinked singleton clusters. A small num-
ber of stories are very big and go on over a long
time. This reflects big media issues such as the
Iraq insurgence, the Iran-nuclear negotiations
and the Israel-Palestine conflict. The latter is the
currently longest story ever (see
http://press.jrc.it/NewsExplorer/storyedition/en/RTERadio-
5f47a76fe35215964cbab22dcbc88d7b.html).

4.2 Aggregating and displaying information
about each story
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969590909091">
For each story, daily updated information gets
stored in the NewsExplorer knowledge base.
This includes (a) the title of the first cluster of
the story (i.e. the title of the medoid article of
that first cluster); (b) the title of the biggest clus-
ter of the story (i.e. the cluster with most arti-
cles); (c) the most frequently mentioned person
names in the story (related people); (d) the per-
son names most highly associated to the story
(associated people, see below); (e) the most fre-
quently mentioned other names in the story
(mostly organisations, but also events such as
Olympics, World War II, etc.); (f) the countries
most frequently referred to in the story (either
directly with the country name or indirectly, e.g.
by referring to a city in that country); (g) a list of
keywords describing the story (see below). This
meta-information is exported every day into
XML files for display on NewsExplorer. The
public web pages display up to 13 keywords, in-
cluding up to three country names and up to two
person or organisation names (see Table 1). To

Stories are currently accessible through three
different indexes (see Figure 2): the stories of the
week, the stories of the month and the biggest
stories (all displayed on the main page of
NewsExplorer). The biggest stories are ordered
by the number of clusters they contain without
any consideration of the beginning date or the
end date. The stories of the month present stories
that started within the last 30 days, stories of the
week those that started within the last seven
days.
For each story, a time line graph (a flash ap-
plication taking an XML export as input) is pro-
duced automatically, allowing users to see trends
and to navigate and explore the story (Figure 3).
While a story can have more than one cluster on
a given day, the graph only displays the largest
cluster for that day.
The story’s keyword signature is computed us-
ing the keywords appearing in most of the con-
stituent clusters. If any of the keywords repre-
sents a country, it will be displayed first. A filter-

one of the selected entities. For instance, if a se-
lected entity is George W. Bush and a selected
country is Iraq, the keywords Bush, George,
Iraqi, etc. will not be displayed.
As mentioned in the previous paragraph, a
story’s related entities are those that have been
mentioned most frequently. This typically in-
cludes many media VIPs. Associated entities are
names that appear in this particular story, but are
not so frequently mentioned in news clusters out-
side this story, according to the following,
TF.IDF-like formula:

with fr(e) being the number of clusters the entity
appears in (in a collection of three years of news)
and C(S,e) being the number of clusters in the
story S mentioning the entity. Inversely, the
NewsExplorer person and organisation pages
also display, for each entity, the biggest stories

Pouliquen et al. 2004): a weighted list of Euro-
voc subject domain descriptors (eurov, available
only for EU languages), a frequency list of per-
son and organisation names (ent), and a weighted
list of direct or indirect references to countries
(geo). As a fourth ingredient, we also make use
of language-dependent keyword lists because
even monolingual keywords sometimes match

more than two languages, our assumption is: If
cluster A is linked to cluster B and cluster C,
then cluster B should also be linked to cluster C.
We furthermore assume that if cluster B is not
linked to cluster C, then cluster B is less likely to
be linked to cluster A. The new algorithm thus
checks these
and calculates a new
similarity value which combines the standard
similarity (described in 5.0) with the number of
inter-links. The formula punishes links to an iso-
lated cluster (i.e. links to a target language clus-
ter which itself is not linked to other linked lan-
guages) and raises the score for inter-linked clus-
ters (i.e. links to a target language cluster which
itself is linked to other linked languages). The
new similari
‘inter-links’
ty score uses the formula:

necessarily reported on the same day across lan-

better results by making use of the available
meta-information at story level described in Sec-

Evaluating such a system is not straightforward
as there is a lot of room for interpretation re-
garding the relatedness of clusters and stories.
Cluster consistency evaluation and the monolin-
gual and cross-lingual linking of individual clus-
ters using a very similar approach has already
been evaluated in Pouliquen et al. (2004).
In order to evaluate the precision for the story
building in four languages, we have evaluated
the relatedness of the individual components (the
clusters) with the story itself. We compiled a list
of 330 randomly selected stories (in the 4 lan-
guages English, German, Italian and Spanish)
and asked an expert to judge if each of the clus-
ters is linked to the main story. For each story,
we thus have a ratio of &apos;correctly linked&apos; clusters
(see Table 3). The average ratio corresponds to
the precision of the story tracking system. There
clearly is room for improvement, but we found the
results good enough to display the automatically
identified stories as part of the live application.
We did make an attempt at evaluating also the
recall for story building, but soon found out that
the results would not make sense. The idea was
to carry out a usage-oriented evaluation for the
situation in which users are looking for any story
of their choice using their own search words (e.g.
Oscar and nomination, Pavarotti and death,
etc.). It was found that relevant stories did indeed
exist for almost every query. However, the re-
sults would entirely depend on the type of story
the evaluator is looking for and on the evalua-
tor’s capacity to identify significant search
words. We can thus not present results for the re-
call evaluation of the story tracking system.

The purpose of a second test was to evaluate
the accuracy of the cross-lingual story linking.
For that purpose, we evaluated those 112 multi-
lingual stories out of the 330 stories in the previ-
ous experiment that had cross-lingual links to
any of the languages Dutch, English, French,
German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish or Swedish.
Table 4 shows that only 59% of the automati-
cally established cross-lingual story links were
accurate, but that the situation improves when
looking at stories consisting of more clusters, i.e.
5 or 10. This trend was confirmed by a separate
study evaluating only the cross-lingual links for
the 10 largest stories in the same four languages,
into the same eight other languages: 87% of the
cross-lingual links were correct. Note that – for
these large stories – the cross-lingual links were
96.5% complete (270 out of 280 possible links
were present). Further insights from this evalua-
tion are that there are only two out of the 40 top
stories that should be merged (there are two Eng-
lish top stories on Israel) and that there is one
cluster in each of the four languages which
should be split (all China-related news merges
into one story). It is clear that more experiments
are needed to improve the cross-lingual links for
smaller stories. We have not evaluated the recall
of the cross-lingual story linking as recall evalua-
tion is very time-consuming and we first want to
optimise the algorithm.

7 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966111111111">
The story tracking system has been running for
two years. There is definitely space for improve-
ment as unrelated clusters are sometimes part of
a story, but informal positive user feedback
makes us believe that users already find the cur-
rent results useful. An analysis of the web logs
shows that more than 400 separate visitors per
day look at story-related information, split quite
evenly across the different languages (Table 5).

<bodyText confidence="0.999991117647059">
The story tracking algorithm is rather sensi-
tive to the starting date for the process: Different
starting dates may result in different stories and
certain starting dates may result in having two
separate parallel stories talking about very
closely related subjects. Another issue is the
seven-day window: We may want to extend the
window as it happens occasionally that a story
‘dies’ because no related articles are published
on the subject for a week, and that another story
talking about the same subject starts 8 days later.
Finally, our algorithm should try to cope with the
fact that stories can split or merge (an issue not
currently dealt with), but this is a non-trivial issue.
Regarding the cross-lingual linking, the current
results are encouraging, but not sufficient. The ac-
curacy needs to be improved before the results can
go online. The most promising idea here is to
make use of each story’s meta-information (lists
of related persons, organisations, countries and
keywords at story level) and to allow a time de-
lay in the publication of stories across languages.
However, the application has high potential, as it
will provide users with (graphically visualisable)
information on how the media report events
across languages and countries.
In a separate effort, a ‘live’ news clustering
system has been developed within EMM, which
groups the news as they come in during the day
(see http://press.jrc.it/NewsBrief/). This process
needs to be integrated with the daily and more
long-term story tracking process so that users can
explore the history and the background for cur-
rent events.
