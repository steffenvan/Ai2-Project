This paper deals with user correc-
tions and aware sites of system er-
rors in the TOOT spoken dialogue
system. We first describe our cor-
pus, and give details on our proced-
ure to label corrections and aware
sites. Then, we show that correc-
tions and aware sites exhibit some
prosodic and other properties which
set them apart from `normal&apos; utter-
ances. It appears that some correc-
tion types, such as simple repeats,
are more likely to be correctly recog-
nized than other types, such as para-
phrases. We also present evidence
that system dialogue strategy affects
users&apos; choice of correction type, sug-
gesting that strategy-specific meth-
ods of detecting or coaching users on
corrections may be useful. Aware
sites tend to be shorter than other
utterances, and are also more dif-
ficult to recognize correctly for the
ASR system.

<bodyText confidence="0.999746557142857">
Compared to many other systems, spoken
dialogue systems (SDS) tend to have more
difficulties in correctly interpreting user in-
put. Whereas a car will normally go left if
the driver turns the steering wheel in that
direction or a vacuum cleaner will start work-
ing if one pushes the on-button, interactions
between a user and a spoken dialogue system
are often hampered by mismatches between
the action intended by the user and the action
executed by the system. Such mismatches
are mainly due to errors in the Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and/or the Nat-
ural Language Understanding (NLU) com-
ponent of these systems. To solve these mis-
matches, users often have to put considerable
effort in trying to make it clear to the system
that there was a problem, and trying to cor-
rect it by re-entering misrecognized or misin-
terpreted information. Previous research has
already brought to light that it is not always
easy for users to determine whether their in-
tended actions were carried out correctly or
not, in particular when the dialogue system
does not give appropriate feedback about its
internal representation at the right moment.
In addition, users&apos; corrections may miss their
goal, because corrections themselves are more
difficult for the system to recognize and in-
terpret correctly, which may lead to so-called
cyclic (or spiral) errors. That corrections
are difficult for ASR systems is generally ex-
plained by the fact that they tend to be hyper-
articulated higher, louder, longer ... than
other turns (Wade et al., 1992; Oviatt et al.,
1996; Levow, 1998; Bell and Gustafson, 1999;
Shimojima et al., 1999), where ASR models
are not well adapted to handle this special
speaking style.
The current paper focuses on user correc-
tions, and looks at places where people first
become aware of a system problem (&amp;quot;aware
sites&amp;quot;). In other papers (Swerts et al., 2000;
Hirschberg et al., 2001; Litman et al., 2001),
we have already given some descriptive stat-
istics on corrections and aware sites and we
have been looking at methods to automatic-
ally predict these two utterance categories.
One of our major findings is that prosody,
which had already been shown to be a good
predictor of misrecognitions (Litman et al.,
2000; Hirschberg et al., 2000), is also useful to
correctly classify corrections and aware sites.
In this paper, we will elaborate more on the
exact labeling scheme we used, and add fur-
ther descriptive statistics. More in particular,
we address the question whether there is much
variance in the way people react to system er-
rors, and if so, to what extent this variance
can be explained on the basis of particular
properties of the dialogue system. In the fol-
lowing section we first provide details on the
TOOT corpus that we used for our analyses.
Then we give information on the labels for
corrections and aware sites, and on the actual
labeling procedure. The next section gives
the results of some descriptive statistics on
properties of corrections and aware sites and
on their distributions. We will end the paper
with a general discussion of our findings.

2.1 The TOOT corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934304347826">
Our corpus consists of dialogues between hu-
man subjects and TOOT, a spoken dialogue
system that allows access to train information
from the web via telephone. TOOT was col-
lected to study variations in dialogue strategy
and in user-adapted interaction (Litman and
Pan, 1999). It is implemented using an
IVR (interactive voice response) platform de-
veloped at AT&amp;T, combining ASR and text-
to-speech with a phone interface (Kamm et
al., 1997). The system&apos;s speech recognizer is
a speaker-independent hidden Markov model
system with context-dependent phone models
for telephone speech and constrained gram-
mars defining vocabulary at any dialogue
state. The platform supports barge-in. Sub-
jects performed four tasks with one of several
versions of the system that differed in terms
of locus of initiative (system, user, or mixed),
confirmation strategy (explicit, implicit, or
none), and whether these conditions could
be changed by the user during the task (ad-
aptive vs. non-adaptive). TOOT&apos;s initiative

strategy specifies who has control of the dia-
logue, while TOOT&apos;s confirmation strategy
specifies how and whether TOOT lets the user
know what it just understood. The fragments
in Figure 1 provide some illustrations of how
dialogues vary with strategy. Subjects were
39 students; 20 native speakers and 19 non-
native, 16 female and 23 male. Dialogues
were recorded and system and user behavior
logged automatically. The concept accuracy
(CA) of each turn was manually labeled. If
the ASR correctly captured all task-related
information in the turn (e.g. time, departure
and arrival cities), the turn&apos;s CA score was
1 (semantically correct). Otherwise, the CA
score reflected the percentage of correctly re-
cognized task information in the turn. The
dialogues were also transcribed and automat-
ically scored in comparison to the ASR re-
cognized string to produce a word error rate
(WER) for each turn. For the study described
below, we examined 2328 user turns (all user
input between two system inputs) from 152
dialogues.

2.2 Defining Corrections and Aware
Sites
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990355">
To identify corrections&apos; in the corpus two au-
thors independently labeled each turn as to
whether or not it constituted a correction of
a prior system failure (a rejection or CA er-
ror, which were the only system failure sub-
jects were aware of) and subsequently de-
cided upon a consensus label. Note that much
of the discrepancies between labels were due
to tiredness or incidental sloppiness of indi-
vidual annotators, rather than true disagree-
ment. Each turn labeled `correction&apos; was fur-
ther classified as belonging to one of the fol-
lowing categories: REP (repetition, includ-
ing repetitions with differences in pronunci-
ation or fluency), PAR (paraphrase), ADD
(task-relevant content added, OMIT (content
omitted), and ADD/OMIT (content both ad-
ded and omitted). Repetitions were further
divided into repetitions with pronunciation
variation (PRON) (e.g. yes correcting yeah),
and repetitions where the correction was pro-
nounced using the same pronunciation as the
original turn, but this distinction was diffi-
cult to make and turned out not to be useful.
User turns which included both corrections
and other speech acts were so distinguished by
labeling them &amp;quot;2+&amp;quot;. For user turns contain-
ing a correction plus one or more additional
dialogue acts, only the correction is used for
purposes of analysis below. We also labeled as
restarts user corrections which followed non-
initial system-initial prompts (e.g. &amp;quot;How may
I help you?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What city do you want to
go to?&amp;quot;); in such cases system and user es-
sentially started the dialogue over from the
beginning. Figure 2 shows examples of each
correction type and additional label for cor-
rections of system failures on I want to go
to Boston on Sunday. Note that the utter-
ance on the last line of this figure is labeled
2+PAR, given that this turn consist of two
speech acts: the goal of the no-part of this

Core, 1997), but this needs to be explored in more
detail in the future.

mainder of this turn serves to correct a prior
error.

Each correction was also indexed with an
identifier representing the closest prior turn
it was correcting, so that we could investigate
&amp;quot;chains&amp;quot; of corrections of a single failed turn,
by tracing back through subsequent correc-
tions of that turn. Figure 3 shows a fragment
of a TOOT dialogue with corrections labeled
as discussed above.
We also identified aware sites in our cor-
pus turns where a user, while interact-
ing with a machine, first becomes aware that
the system has misrecognized a previous user
turn. For our corpus, we tried to determ-
ine whether there was some evidence in the
user turn indicating that the user had be-
come aware of a mistake in the system&apos;s un-
derstanding of a previous user turn, and, if
so, which previous turn had occasioned that
error. Note that such aware sites may or
may not also be corrections (another type of
post-misrecognition turn), since a user may
not immediately provide correcting informa-
tion. Also, it may take a while before the
user is able to notice a system error. Fig-
ure 4 shows an example that illustrates cases
in which both the user&apos;s awareness and cor-
rection of a misrecognition occur in the same
turn (e.g. turns 1159 and 1160, after sys-
tem prompts for information already given in
turn 1158). It also illustrates cases in which
aware sites and corrections occur in different
turns. For example, after the immediate ex-
plicit system confirmation of turn 1162, the
user first becomes aware of the system errors

(turn 1163), then separately corrects them
(turn 1164). When no immediate confirm-
ation of an utterance occurs (as with turn
1158), it may take several turns before the
user becomes aware of any misrecognition er-
rors. For example, it is not until turn 1161
that the user first becomes aware of the er-
ror in date and time from 1158; the user then
corrects the error in 1162. Of all turns in
our corpus, 13% represent cases of turns that
are only corrections, 14% are only aware sites,
and 16% are turns where aware sites and cor-
rections co-occur. Also, note that turns 1162

cases of restarts after a system-initial, non-

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999398541666667">
We identified 29% of the turns in the corpus
as corrections. These were a serious prob-
lem for the system, being misrecognized in
terms of transcription error about twice as
often (61%) as non-corrections (33%) and in
terms of concept error in 53% of cases for cor-
rections compared with 21% concept error for
non-corrections.
Corrections differed from non-corrections
in other ways as well, which are suggest-
ive of how they might be identified by an
SDS. We have previously discussed the pros-
odic and acoustic differences between correc-
tions and non-correction (Swerts et al., 2000;
Hirschberg et al., 2001). In particular, in
line with previous studies, we found that cor-
rections more often tend to be hyperarticu-
lated (longer, louder, with great pitch excur-
sions,...) than other turns. More recently we
have also discovered differences in other di-
mensions.
First, corrections appear to be longer than
non-corrections in numbers of words, when
we examine actual human transcriptions of

them, both in absolute terms (T=17.68;
df=2326; p=0) and also controlling for
speaker (T=5.32; df=38; p=0). Even the
ASR hypotheses show this difference, with
hypotheses of corrections being longer in ab-
solute terms (T=13.72; df=2326; p=0) and
across speakers (T=5.18; df=38; p=0).
Of the correction types we labeled, the
largest number were REPs and OMITs, as
shown in Table 1, which shows over-all dis-
tribution of correction types, and distribu-
tions for each type of system failure corrected.
Table 1 shows that 39% of TOOT corrections
were simple repetitions of the previously mis-
recognized turn. While this strategy is often
suboptimal in correcting ASR errors (Levow,
1998), REPs (45% error) and OMITs (52% er-
ror) were better recognized than ADDs (90%
error) and PARs (72% error). Thus, over-
all, users tend to have a preference for correc-
tion types that are more likely to be succes-
ful. That REPs and OMITs are more often
correctly recognized can be linked to the ob-
servation that they tend to be realized with
prosody which is less marked than the pros-
ody on ADDs and PARs. Table 2 shows that
REPs and OMITs are closer to normal utter-
ances in terms of their prosodic features than
ADDs, which are considerably higher, longer
and slower. This is in line with our previous
observations that marked settings for these
prosodic features more often lead to recogni-
tion errors.
What the user was correcting also influ-
enced the type of correction chosen. Table
1 shows that corrections of misrecognitions
(Post-Mrec) were more likely to omit inform-
ation present in the original turn (OMITs),
while corrections of rejections (Post-Rej) were
more likely to be simple repetitions. The
latter finding is not surprising, since the re-
jection message for tasks was always a close
paraphrase of &amp;quot;Sorry, I can&apos;t understand
you. Can you please repeat your utterance?&amp;quot;
However, it does suggest the surprising power
of system directions, and how important it is
to craft prompts to favor the type of correc-
tion most easily recognized by the system.
Corrections following system restarts
differed in type somewhat from other correc-
tions, with more turns adding new material
to the correction and fewer of them repeating

the original turn.
Dialogue strategy clearly affected the type
of correction users made. For example, users
more frequently repeat their misrecognized
utterance in the SystemExplicit condition,
than in the MixedImplicit or UserNoConfirm;
the latter conditions have larger proportions
of OMITs and ADDs. This is an important
observation given that this suggests that some
dialogue strategies lead to correction types,
such as ADDs, which are more likely to be
misrecognized than correction types elicited
by other strategies.
As noted above, corrections in the TOOT
corpus often take the form of chains of correc-
tions of a single original error. Looking back
at Figure 3, for example, we see two chains
of corrections: In the first, which begins with
the misrecognition of turn 776 (&amp;quot;Um, tomor-
row&amp;quot;), the user repeats the original phrase
and then provides a paraphrase (&amp;quot;Saturday&amp;quot;),
which is correctly recognized. In the second,
beginning with turn 780, the time of depar-
ture is misrecognized. The user omits some
information (&amp;quot;am&amp;quot;) in turn 781, but without
success; an ADD correction follows, with the
previously omitted information restored, in
turn 783. Elsewhere (Swerts et al. 2000),
we have shown that chain position has an in-
fluence on correction behaviour in the sense
that more distant corrections tend to be mis-
recognized more often than corrections closer
to the original error.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998542">
3.2 Aware Sites
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999866172413793">
708 (30%) of the turns in our corpus were
labeled aware sites. The majority of these
turns (89%) immediately follow the system
failures they react to, unlike the more com-
plex cases in Figure 4 above. If a system
would be able to detect aware sites with a
reasonable accuracy, this would be useful,
given that the system would then be able to
correctly guess in the majority of the cases
that the problem occurred in the preceding
turn. Aware turns, like corrections, tend to
be misrecognized at a higher rate than other
turns; in terms of transcription accuracy, 50%
of awares are misrecognized vs. 35% of other
turns, and in terms of concept accuracy, 39%
of awares are misrecognized compared to 27%
of other turns. In other words, both types
of post-error utterances, i.e., corrections and
aware sites, share the fact that they tend to
lead to additional errors. But whereas we
have shown above that for corrections this is
probably caused by the fact that these utter-
ances are uttered in a hyperarticulated speak-
ing style, we do not find differences in hyper-
articulation between aware sites and `normal
utterances&apos; (T= 0.9085; df=38; p=0.3693).
This could mean that these sites are real-
ized in a speaking style which is not per-
ceptibly different from normal speaking style

and other turns for aware sites versus other
utterances
when judged by human labelers, but which
is still sufficiently different to cause problems
for an ASR system.
In terms of distinguishing features which
might explain or help to identify these turns,
we have previously examined the acoustic
and prosodic features of aware sites (Lit-
man et al., 2001). Here we present some
additional features. Aware sites appear to
be significantly shorter, in general, than
other turns, both in absolute terms and con-
trolling for speaker variation, and whether
we examine the ASR transcription (absolute:
T=4.86; df=2326; p=0; speaker-controlled:
T=5.37; df=38; p=0) or the human one (ab-
solute: T=3.45; df=2326; p&lt;.0001; speaker-
controlled: T=4.69; df=38; p=0). A sizable
but not overwhelming number of aware sites
in fact consist of a simple negation (i.e., a vari-
ant of the word `no&apos;) (see Table 4). This at
the same time shows that a simple no-detector
will not be sufficient as an indicator of aware
sites (see also (Krahmer et al., 1999; Krahmer
et al., to appear)), given that most aware sites
are more complex than that, such as turns
1159 and 1160 in the example of Figure 4.
More concretely, Table 4 shows that a single
no would correctly predict that the turn is an
aware site with a precision of only 57% and a
recall of only 23%.

This paper has dealt with user corrections and
aware sites of system errors in the TOOT
spoken dialogue system. We have described
our corpus, and have given details on our pro-
cedure to label corrections and aware sites.
Then, we have shown that corrections and
aware sites exhibit some prosodic and other
properties which set them apart from `normal&apos;
utterances. It appears that some correction
types, such as simple repeats, are more likely
to be correctly recognized than other types,
such as paraphrases. We have also presen-
ted evidence that system dialogue strategy
affects users&apos; choice of correction type, sug-
gesting that strategy-specific methods of de-
tecting or coaching users on corrections may
be useful. Aware sites tend to be shorter than
other utterances, and are also more difficult
to recognize correctly for the ASR system.
In addition to the descriptive study presen-
ted in this paper, we have also tried to auto-
matically predict corrections and aware sites
using the machine learning program RIP-
PER (Cohen, 1996). These experiments show
that corrections and aware sites can be clas-
sified as such automatically, with a consider-
able degree of accuracy (Litman et al., 2001;
Hirschberg et al., 2001). Such classification,
we believe, will be especially useful in error-
handling for SDS. If aware sites are detect-
able, they can function as backward-looking
error-signaling devices, making it clear to the
system that something has gone wrong in
the preceding context, so that, for example,
the system can reprompt for information. In
this way, they are similar to what others
have termed `go-back&apos; signals (Krahmer et
al., 1999). Aware sites can also be used as
forward-looking signals, indicating upcoming
corrections or more drastic changes in user be-
havior, such as complete restarts of the task.
Given that, in current systems, both correc-
tions and restarts often lead to recognition er-
ror (Swerts et al., 2000), aware sites may be
useful in preparing systems to deal with such
problems. An accurate detection of turns that
are corrections may trigger the use of specially
trained ASR models to better recognize cor-
rections, or can be used to change dialogue
strategy (e.g. from user or mixed initiative to
system initiative after errors).

<abstract confidence="0.9977486">This paper deals with user corrections and aware sites of system errors in the TOOT spoken dialogue system. We first describe our corpus, and give details on our procedure to label corrections and aware sites. Then, we show that corrections and aware sites exhibit some prosodic and other properties which set them apart from `normal&apos; utterances. It appears that some correction types, such as simple repeats, are more likely to be correctly recognized than other types, such as paraphrases. We also present evidence that system dialogue strategy affects users&apos; choice of correction type, suggesting that strategy-specific methods of detecting or coaching users on corrections may be useful. Aware sites tend to be shorter than other utterances, and are also more difficult to recognize correctly for the ASR system.</abstract>

These were a serious problem for the system, being misrecognized in terms of transcription error about twice as often (61%) as non-corrections (33%) and in terms of concept error in 53% of cases for corrections compared with 21% concept error for non-corrections. Corrections differed from non-corrections in other ways as well, which are suggestive of how they might be identified by an SDS. We have previously discussed the prosodic and acoustic differences between corrections and non-correction (Swerts et al., 2000; Hirschberg et al., 2001). In particular, in line with previous studies, we found that corrections more often tend to be hyperarticulated (longer, louder, with great pitch excursions,...) than other turns. More recently we have also discovered differences in other dimensions. First, corrections appear to be longer than non-corrections in numbers of words, when we examine actual human transcriptions of Turn Turn ID Aware of Corr of S: How may I help you?

We will end the paper with a general discussion of our findings. 2 The data 2.1 The TOOT corpus Our corpus consists of dialogues between human subjects and TOOT, a spoken dialogue system that allows access to train information from the web via telephone. TOOT was collected to study variations in dialogue strategy and in user-adapted interaction (Litman and Pan, 1999). It is implemented using an IVR (interactive voice response) platform developed at AT&amp;T, combining ASR and textto-speech with a phone interface (Kamm et al., 1997). The system&apos;s speech recognizer is a speaker-independent hidden Markov model system with context-dependent phone models for telephone speech and constrained grammars defining vocabulary at any dialogue state. The platform supports barge-in. Subjects performed four tasks with one of several versions of the system that differed in terms of locus of initiative (system, user, or mixed), confirmation strategy (explicit, implicit, or none), and whether these conditions could be changed by the user during the task (adaptive vs. non-adaptive).

A sizable but not overwhelming number of aware sites in fact consist of a simple negation (i.e., a variant of the word `no&apos;) (see Table 4). This at the same time shows that a simple no-detector will not be sufficient as an indicator of aware sites (see also (Krahmer et al., 1999; Krahmer et al., to appear)), given that most aware sites are more complex than that, such as turns 1159 and 1160 in the example of Figure 4. More concretely, Table 4 shows that a single no would correctly predict that the turn is an aware site with a precision of only 57% and a recall of only 23%. 4 Discussion This paper has dealt with user corrections and aware sites of system errors in the TOOT spoken dialogue system.

Even the ASR hypotheses show this difference, with hypotheses of corrections being longer in absolute terms (T=13.72; df=2326; p=0) and across speakers (T=5.18; df=38; p=0). Of the correction types we labeled, the largest number were REPs and OMITs, as shown in Table 1, which shows over-all distribution of correction types, and distributions for each type of system failure corrected. Table 1 shows that 39% of TOOT corrections were simple repetitions of the previously misrecognized turn. While this strategy is often suboptimal in correcting ASR errors (Levow, 1998), REPs (45% error) and OMITs (52% error) were better recognized than ADDs (90% error) and PARs (72% error). Thus, overall, users tend to have a preference for correction types that are more likely to be succesful. That REPs and OMITs are more often correctly recognized can be linked to the observation that they tend to be realized with prosody which is less marked than the prosody on ADDs and PARs. Table 2 shows that REPs and OMITs are closer to normal utterances in terms of their prosodic features than ADDs, which are considerably higher, longer and slower.

The current paper focuses on user corrections, and looks at places where people first become aware of a system problem (&amp;quot;aware sites&amp;quot;). In other papers (Swerts et al., 2000; Hirschberg et al., 2001; Litman et al., 2001), we have already given some descriptive statistics on corrections and aware sites and we have been looking at methods to automatically predict these two utterance categories. One of our major findings is that prosody, which had already been shown to be a good predictor of misrecognitions (Litman et al., 2000; Hirschberg et al., 2000), is also useful to correctly classify corrections and aware sites. In this paper, we will elaborate more on the exact labeling scheme we used, and add further descriptive statistics.

In terms of distinguishing features which might explain or help to identify these turns, we have previously examined the acoustic and prosodic features of aware sites (Litman et al., 2001). Here we present some additional features. Aware sites appear to be significantly shorter, in general, than other turns, both in absolute terms and controlling for speaker variation, and whether we examine the ASR transcription (absolute: T=4.86; df=2326; p=0; speaker-controlled: T=5.37; df=38; p=0) or the human one (absolute: T=3.45; df=2326; p&lt;.0001; speakercontrolled: T=4.69; df=38; p=0). A sizable but not overwhelming number of aware sites in fact consist of a simple negation (i.e., a variant of the word `no&apos;) (see Table 4). This at the same time shows that a simple no-detector will not b</context>

Aware sites tend to be shorter than other utterances, and are also more difficult to recognize correctly for the ASR system. In addition to the descriptive study presented in this paper, we have also tried to automatically predict corrections and aware sites using the machine learning program RIPPER (Cohen, 1996). These experiments show that corrections and aware sites can be classified as such automatically, with a considerable degree of accuracy (Litman et al., 2001; Hirschberg et al., 2001). Such classification, we believe, will be especially useful in errorhandling for SDS. If aware sites are detectable, they can function as backward-looking error-signaling devices, making it clear to the system that something has gone wrong in the preceding context, so that, for example, the system can reprompt for information. In this way, they are similar to what others have termed `go-back&apos; signals (Krahmer et al., 1999). Aware sites can also be used as forward-looking signals, indicating upcoming corrections or more drastic changes in user behavior, such as comple</context>

The next section gives the results of some descriptive statistics on properties of corrections and aware sites and on their distributions. We will end the paper with a general discussion of our findings. 2 The data 2.1 The TOOT corpus Our corpus consists of dialogues between human subjects and TOOT, a spoken dialogue system that allows access to train information from the web via telephone. TOOT was collected to study variations in dialogue strategy and in user-adapted interaction (Litman and Pan, 1999). It is implemented using an IVR (interactive voice response) platform developed at AT&amp;T, combining ASR and textto-speech with a phone interface (Kamm et al., 1997). The system&apos;s speech recognizer is a speaker-independent hidden Markov model system with context-dependent phone models for telephone speech and constrained grammars defining vocabulary at any dialogue state. The platform supports barge-in. Subjects performed four tasks with one of several versions of the system that differed in terms of locus of initiative (system, user, or mixed), confirmation strategy (explicit, implicit, or non</context>

These were a serious problem for the system, being misrecognized in terms of transcription error about twice as often (61%) as non-corrections (33%) and in terms of concept error in 53% of cases for corrections compared with 21% concept error for non-corrections. Corrections differed from non-corrections in other ways as well, which are suggestive of how they might be identified by an SDS. We have previously discussed the prosodic and acoustic differences between corrections and non-correction (Swerts et al., 2000; Hirschberg et al., 2001). In particular, in line with previous studies, we found that corrections more often tend to be hyperarticulated (longer, louder, with great pitch excursions,...) than other turns. More recently we have also discovered differences in other dimensions. First, corrections appear to be longer than non-corrections in numbers of words, when we examine actual human transcriptions of Turn Turn ID Aware of Corr of S: How may I help you?

Looking back at Figure 3, for example, we see two chains of corrections: In the first, which begins with the misrecognition of turn 776 (&amp;quot;Um, tomorrow&amp;quot;), the user repeats the original phrase and then provides a paraphrase (&amp;quot;Saturday&amp;quot;), which is correctly recognized. In the second, beginning with turn 780, the time of departure is misrecognized. The user omits some information (&amp;quot;am&amp;quot;) in turn 781, but without success; an ADD correction follows, with the previously omitted information restored, in turn 783. Elsewhere (Swerts et al. 2000), we have shown that chain position has an influence on correction behaviour in the sense that more distant corrections tend to be misrecognized more often than corrections closer to the original error. 3.2 Aware Sites 708 (30%) of the turns in our corpus were labeled aware sites. The majority of these turns (89%) immediately follow the system failures they react to, unlike the more complex cases in Figure 4 above. If a system would be able to detect aware sites with a reasonable accuracy, this would be useful, given that the system would then be able to correctly guess in the majority of the </context>
