WordNet and FrameNet are widely used lexi-
cal resources, but they are very different from
each other and are often used in completely
different ways in NLP. In a case study in which
a short passage is annotated in both frame-
works, we show how the synsets and defini-
tions of WordNet and the syntagmatic infor-
mation from FrameNet can complement each
other, forming a more complete representa-
tion of the lexical semantic of a text than ei-
ther could alone. Close comparisons between
them also suggest ways in which they can be
brought into alignment.

1 Background and motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851444444445">
FrameNet and WordNet are two lexical databases that
are widely used for NLP, often in conjunction. Because
of their complementary designs they are obvious candi-
dates for alignment, and an exploratory research project
within the larger context of the semantic annotation of
the the American national Corpus is currently under-
way. We give specific illustrative examples of annota-
tions against both resources, highlighting their different
contributions towards a rich semantic analysis.
WordNet (WN):1 (Fellbaum, 1998), is a large elec-
tronic lexical database of English. Originally con-
ceived as a full-scale model of human semantic orga-
nization, it was quickly embraced by the Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) community, a development
that guided its subsequent growth and design. Word-
Net has become the lexical database of choice for NLP
and has been incorporated into other language tools,
including VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) and OntoNotes
(Hovy et al., 2006). Numerous on-line dictionaries, in-
cluding Google’s “define” function, rely significantly
on WordNet.
WordNet’s coverage is sometimes criticized as be-
ing too fine-grained for automatic processing, though
its inventory is not larger than that of a standard col-
legiate dictionary. But the present limitation of auto-
matic WSD cannot be entirely blamed on existing sys-
tems; for example, Fellbaum and Grabowski (1997)

have shown that humans, too, have difficulties identi-
fying context-appropriate dictionary senses. One an-
swer is clearly that meanings do not exist outside con-
texts. Furthermore, although WN does contain “sen-
tence frames” such as “Somebody —-s something”
for a transitive verb with a human agent, it provides
little syntagmatic information, except for what can
be gleaned from the example sentences. WordNet’s
great strength is its extensive coverage, with more than
117,000 synonym sets (synsets), each with a definition
and relations to other synsets covering almost all the
general vocabulary of English.
FrameNet (FN):2 (Fontenelle, 2003) is a lexical
resource organized not around words per se, but se-
mantic frames (Fillmore, 1976): characterizations of
events, relations, and states which are the conceptual
basis for understanding groups of word senses, called
lexical units (LUs). Frames are distinguished by the
set of roles involved, known as frame elements (FEs).
Much of the information in the FrameNet lexicon is
derived by annotating corpus sentences; for each LU,
groups of sentences are extracted from a corpus, sen-
tences which collectively exemplify all of the lexico-
graphically relevant syntactic patterns in which the LU
occurs. A few examples of each pattern are annotated;
annotators not only mark the target word which evokes
the frame in the mind of the hearer, but also mark
those phrases which are syntactically related to the tar-
get word and express its frame elements. FrameNet is
much smaller than WordNet, covering roughly 11,000
LUs, but contains very rich syntagmatic information
about the combinatorial possibilities of each LU.
Given these two lexical resources with different
strengths, it seems clear that combining WN and FN
annotation will produce a more complete semantic rep-
resentation of the meaning of a text than either could
alone. What follows is intended as an example of how
they can usefully be combined.

Greece, specifically the Aegean islands after the fall of
Byzantium to the Crusaders. Although brief, its three
sentences provide ample material to demonstrate some
of the subtlety of both WN and FN annotation:
(1) While Byzantine land was being divided, there
was no one in control of the seas, so pirates raided
towns on many of the islands. (2) To counter this, the
populations moved from their homes on the coast and
built settlements inland, out of sight of the raiding par-
ties. (3) This created a pattern seen today throughout
the Aegean of a small port (skala) which serves an in-
land settlement or chora, making it easier to protect the
islandfrom attack.
Below, we present three tables containing the anno-
tation of both the WordNet synsets for each open class
(content) word in the text4 and the FrameNet frames
and the fillers of the frame elements in each sentence.
We also provide brief notes on some interesting fea-
tures of the semantics of each sentence.

2.1 Discussion of Sentence 1, shown in Table 1 on
page 4 :
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963815571428572">
(2) Information about what the land was separated into
is not given in the sentence nor clear from the context,
so the PARTS FE has been annotated as “indefinite null
instantiated” (INI). Clearly this is an intentional action,
but because the verb is passive, the agent can be (and
is) omitted, so the AGENT FE is marked as “construc-
tionally null instantiated” (CNI).5
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.939061285714286">
(4) In addition to FEs and their phrase types and
grammatical functions, FrameNet annotates a limited
set of syntactic facts: here, in is annotated as at “sup-
port preposition”, allowing control to function as an ad-
jectival, and was as a copula, allowing no one to fill the
External syntactic position of in control.
(5) Since FN is based on semantic frames, annota-

<bodyText confidence="0.948701222222222">
tion of nouns is largely limited to those which express
events (e.g. destruction), relations (brother), or states
(height). For the most part, nouns denoting artifacts
and natural kinds evoke relatively uninteresting frames,
and hence relatively few of them have been included
in FN. However, there are three such instances in this
sentence, seas, islands (9), and towns (12); In all three
cases, the frame-evoking noun also denotes the filler of
the FE LOCALE.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98927475">
(6) At the top level of organization, so evokes
the Causation frame. Actually, it is misleading to
simply annotate control of the seas in the frames
Be in control and Natural features; here, we regard
seas as metonymic for “ship traffic on the seas”, but
neither the FN annotation nor the WN definition indi-
cates this.
(7) The noun pirates evokes the very rich frame of

4Note that for reasons of space, many WN examples have
been omitted.
5In fact, the previous sentence describes the sack of Con-
stantinople by the Crusaders, so they can be inferred to be the
dividers of the lands, as well.

<bodyText confidence="0.975357823529412">
Piracy, and also denotes the filler of the FE PERPE-
TRATOR, but that is the only FE filled in in that frame.
Instead, pirates actually fills the ASSAILANT FE of the
Attack frame, (8); the main idea is about the raids, not
the piratical acts on the seas that the same people have a
habit of committing. Note that the WN definition takes
the view that raiding coastal towns is a typical part of
piracy.
(10) Political locales roughly corresponds to
“Geopolitical entity” in named entity recognition.
Despite the relatively fine level of detail of the anno-
tations, there are still many important semantic features
of the sentence not represented in FrameNet or Word-
Net. For example, there is no treatment of negation cum
quantification, no representation of the fact that there
was no one in control should mean that Be in control
is not happening.

2.2 Discussion of Sentence 2, shown in Table 2 on
page 5:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999181777777778">
The two highest level predicates in this sentence are
moved (2) and built (6), in the frames Motion and
Building respectively; since they are conjoined, the
phrase to counter this fills the FE PURPOSE in both
frames. 6 In (2) the GOAL FE of the Motion is marked
as definite null instantiation (DNI), because, although
it is not expressed in the VP headed by moved, it is
recoverable from context (i.e. the second VP).
(4) Note that FN puts this sense of home in the Build-
ings frame7, but WN has a less specific definition. (6)
Coast is a Relational natural feature because it is de-
fined in relation to another natural feature; a coast
has to be the coast of some land mass, although here
the land mass is DNI. (9) Inland both evokes a Loca-
tive relation and denotes the GROUND FE. (10) FN and
WN agree on a sense of sight denoting the range of vi-
sion. (11) WN’s example sentence for raid is precisely
about pirates.

(2) The concept of “pattern” is very slippery–the ar-
rangement of port and inland settlement is both spa-
tial and temporal in terms of building practices over
centuries. (3) This sense of see can refer to the area
in which something is seen, the time, or the condi-
tions under which it can be seen; these are subsumed
by the FE STATE. (4) Today expresses a Tempo-
ral collocation and denotes the LANDMARK. (Repe-
titions of the words settlement and island have been
omitted.) The interrelation among (7), (10), (11) and
(12) is rather complex: the arrangement in which the
port serves the settlement has the making easier as a
result. The arrangement is also the CAUSE FE of mak-
ing. Easier in the Difficulty frame requires an EX-

3 Towards an alignment of WordNet and
FrameNet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998294333333334">
We hope these examples have shown that finding re-
lated WN and FN senses can contribute to text under-
standing. Fellbaum and Baker (2008) discuss the re-
spective strengths and weaknesses of WN and FN as
well as their complementary advantages that could be
fruitfully exploited aligning the two resources. Work
of this type is actually underway; researchers are semi-
automatically annotating selected lemmas in the Amer-
ican National Corpus with both FN frames and WN
senses. The lemmas are chosen so as to reflect the part
of speech distribution in text and to represent a spec-
trum of frequency and polysemy. A preliminary group
of instances are manually tagged by trained annotators,
and then the teams working on WN and FN annota-
tion discuss and resolve discrepancies among the tag-
gers before the remaining tokens are annotated.
Three cases sum up the annotation and alignment
process:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99160825">
(1) In the very unlikely case that a synset and a frame
contain exactly the same set of lexemes, their corre-
spondence is simply recorded.
(2) In the more common case in which all the words
in a synset are a subset of those in the frame, or all the
words in a frame are a subset of those in the synset, this
fact is also recorded.
(3) In case two synsets are subsets of the LUs of one
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9972991">
frame, we will record this and note that it as a possible
candidate for collapsing the synsets, respectively.
FN and WN are two comprehensive but comple-
mentary lexical resources. Both WN’s paradigmatic
and FN’s syntagmatic approach to lexical semantics are
needed for a rich representation of word meaning in
context. We have demonstrated how text can be an-
notated against both resources to provide the founda-
tion for deep language understanding and, as an im-
portant by-product, help to align the word senses of
these widely-used resources. Of course, these ex-
amples were manually annotated, but automatic sys-
tems for word-sense disambiguation (largely based on
WordNet) and FrameNet role labeling (Johansson and
Nugues, 2007; Coppola et al., 2008) are improving
rapidly. The project just described is intended to pro-
vide more gold-standard annotation (both WN and FN)
to help train automatic systems for both WN and FN
annotation, which are clearly related tasks e.g. (Prad-
han et al., 2007; Erk, 2005).

Word- Net has become the lexical database of choice for NLP and has been incorporated into other language tools, including VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) and OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006). Numerous on-line dictionaries, including Google’s “define” function, rely significantly on WordNet. WordNet’s coverage is sometimes criticized as being too fine-grained for automatic processing, though its inventory is not larger than that of a standard collegiate dictionary. But the present limitation of automatic WSD cannot be entirely blamed on existing systems; for example, Fellbaum and Grabowski (1997) have shown that humans, too, have difficulties identifying context-appropriate dictionary senses. One answer is clearly that meanings do not exist outside contexts. Furthermore, although WN does contain “sentence frames” such as “Somebody —-s something” for a transitive verb with a human agent, it provides little syntagmatic information, except for what can be gleaned from the example sentences. WordNet’s great strength is its extensive coverage, with more than synonym sets each with a definition and relations to other synsets covering almost all the general vocabulary of English. (Fontenelle, 2003) is a lexical organized not around words but seframes 1976): characterizations of events, relations, and states which are the conceptual basis for understanding groups of word senses, called units Frames are distinguished by the of roles involved, known as elements Much of the information in the FrameNet lexicon is derived by annotating corpus sentences; for each LU, groups of sentences are extracted from a corpus, sentences which collectively exemplify all of the lexicographically relevant syntactic patterns in which the LU occurs. A few examples of each pattern are annotated; not only mark the target word which the frame in the mind of the hearer, but also mark those phrases which are syntactically related to the target word and express its frame elements. FrameNet is much smaller than WordNet, covering roughly 11,000 LUs, but contains very rich syntagmatic information about the combinatorial possibilities of each LU. Given these two lexical resources with different strengths, it seems clear that combining WN and FN annotation will produce a more complete semantic representation of the meaning of a text than either could alone. What follows is intended as an example of how they can usefully be combined. 2 Case Study: Aegean History The text chosen for this study is a paragraph from the National (Ide et al., 2002), from the Berlitz travel guide to Greece, discussing the history of 125 of the Third Linguistic Annotation Workshop, ACL-IJCNLP pages Singapore, 6-7 August 2009. ACL and AFNLP Greece, specifically the Aegean islands after the fall of Byzantium to the Crusaders. Although brief, its three sentences provide ample material to demonstrate some of the subtlety of both WN and FN annotation: (1) While Byzantine land was being divided, there was no one in control of the seas, so pirates raided towns on many of the islands. (2) To counter this, the populations moved from their homes on the coast and built settlements inland, out of sight of the raiding parties. (3) This created a pattern seen today throughout Aegean of a small port serves an insettlement or it easier to protect the islandfrom attack. Below, we present three tables containing the annotation of both the WordNet synsets for each open class word in the and the FrameNet frames and the fillers of the frame elements in each sentence. We also provide brief notes on some interesting features of the semantics of each sentence. 2.1 Discussion of Sentence 1, shown in Table 1 on page 4 : (2) Information about what the land was separated into is not given in the sentence nor clear from the context, the has been annotated as “indefinite null instantiated” (INI). Clearly this is an intentional action, but because the verb is passive, the agent can be (and omitted, so the is marked as “construcnull instantiated” (4) In addition to FEs and their phrase types and grammatical functions, FrameNet annotates a limited of syntactic facts: here, annotated as at “suppreposition”, allowing function as an adand a copula, allowing one fill the syntactic position of (5) Since FN is based on semantic frames, annotation of nouns is largely limited to those which express (e.g. relations or states For the most part, nouns denoting artifacts and natural kinds evoke relatively uninteresting frames, and hence relatively few of them have been included in FN. However, there are three such instances in this and In all three the frame-evoking noun also filler of FE At the top level of organization, the Causation frame. Actually, it is misleading to annotate of the seas the frames Be in control and Natural features; here, we regard metonymic for “ship traffic on the seas”, but neither the FN annotation nor the WN definition indicates this. The noun the very rich frame of that for reasons of space, many WN examples have been omitted. fact, the previous sentence describes the sack of Constantinople by the Crusaders, so they can be inferred to be the dividers of the lands, as well. and also denotes the filler of the FE but that is the only FE filled in in that frame. fills the of the Attack frame, (8); the main idea is about the raids, not the piratical acts on the seas that the same people have a habit of committing. Note that the WN definition takes view that raiding coastal towns typical part of piracy. (10) Political locales roughly corresponds to “Geopolitical entity” in named entity recognition. Despite the relatively fine level of detail of the annotations, there are still many important semantic features of the sentence not represented in FrameNet or Word- For example, there is no treatment of negation no representation of the fact that no one in control mean that Be in control is not happening. 2.2 Discussion of Sentence 2, shown in Table 2 on page 5: The two highest level predicates in this sentence are and in the frames Motion and Building respectively; since they are conjoined, the counter this the FE both 6In (2) the of the Motion is marked as definite null instantiation (DNI), because, although is not expressed in the VP headed by it is recoverable from context (i.e. the second VP).

Fellbaum and Baker (2008) discuss the respective strengths and weaknesses of WN and FN as well as their complementary advantages that could be fruitfully exploited aligning the two resources. Work of this type is actually underway; researchers are semiautomatically annotating selected lemmas in the American National Corpus with both FN frames and WN senses. The lemmas are chosen so as to reflect the part of speech distribution in text and to represent a spectrum of frequency and polysemy. A preliminary group of instances are manually tagged by trained annotators, and then the teams working on WN and FN annotation discuss and resolve discrepancies among the taggers before the remaining tokens are annotated. Three cases sum up the annotation and alignment process: (1) In the very unlikely case that a synset and a frame contain exactly the same set of lexemes, their correspondence is simply recorded. (2) In the more common case in which all the words in a synset are a subset of those in the frame, or all the words in a frame are a subset of those in the synset, this fact is also recorded. (3) In case two synsets are subsets of the LUs of one frame, we will record this and note that it as a possible candidate for collapsing the synsets, respectively. FN and WN are two comprehensive but complementary lexical resources. Both WN’s paradigmatic and FN’s syntagmatic approach to lexical semantics are needed for a rich representation of word meaning in context. We have demonstrated how text can be annotated against both resources to provide the foundation for deep language understanding and, as an important by-product, help to align the word senses of these widely-used resources. Of course, these examples were manually annotated, but automatic systems for word-sense disambiguation (largely based on WordNet) and FrameNet role labeling (Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Coppola et al., 2008) are improving rapidly. The project just described is intended to provide more gold-standard annotation (both WN and FN) to help train automatic systems for both WN and FN annotation, which are clearly related tasks e.g. (Prad-</abstract>
