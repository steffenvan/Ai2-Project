Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99990285">
Several incompatible syntactic annotation
schemes are currently used by parsers and
corpora in biomedical information extrac-
tion. The recently introduced Stanford de-
pendency scheme has been suggested to be
a suitable unifying syntax formalism. In this
paper, we present a step towards such uni-
fication by creating a conversion from the
Link Grammar to the Stanford scheme. Fur-
ther, we create a version of the BioInfer cor-
pus with syntactic annotation in this scheme.
We present an application-oriented evalua-
tion of the transformation and assess the
suitability of the scheme and our conversion
to the unification of the syntactic annotations
of BioInfer and the GENIA Treebank.
We find that a highly reliable conversion is
both feasible to create and practical, increas-
ing the applicability of both the parser and
the corpus to information extraction.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999751418604651">
One of the main challenges in biomedical infor-
mation extraction (IE) targeting entity relationships
such as protein-protein interactions arises from the
complexity and variability of the natural language
statements used to express such relationships. To
address this complexity, many biomedical IE sys-
tems (Alphonse et al., 2004; Rinaldi et al., 2004;
Fundel et al., 2007) and annotated corpora (Kim et
al., 2003; Aubin, 2005; Pyysalo et al., 2007) incor-
porate full syntactic analysis. However, there are
significant differences between the syntactic anno-
tation schemes employed. This leads to difficulties
in sharing data between corpora and establishing the
relative performance of parsers as well as to a lack
of interchangeability of one parser for another in IE
systems, among other issues.
Syntax formalisms are broadly divided into con-
stituency and dependency. Constituency schemes
are dominant in many fields and are unified under
the established Penn Treebank (PTB) scheme (Bies
et al., 1995). However, dependency schemes have
been suggested to be preferable in IE, as they repre-
sent the semantic structure of the sentences more di-
rectly (see, e.g., de Marneffe et al. (2006)). Further,
Lin (1998) argues for dependency-based evaluation
of both dependency and constituency parsers since
it allows evaluation metrics that are more relevant
to semantic interpretation as well as intuitively more
meaningful. Even though there is clearly a need for a
unifying scheme for dependency comparable to that
of PTB for constituency, no widely adopted standard
currently exists.
In this paper, we present a step towards unify-
ing the diverse syntax schemes in use in IE sys-
tems and corpora such as the GENIA Treebank1 and
the recently introduced BioInfer corpus (Pyysalo et
al., 2007). Clegg and Shepherd (2007) have re-
cently proposed to use the Stanford dependency
scheme (de Marneffe et al., 2006) as a common,
application-oriented syntax representation. To as-
sess this choice, we develop a set of conversion
rules for transforming the Link Grammar (LG) de-
pendency scheme (Sleator and Temperley, 1993) to

the Stanford scheme and then create a version of
the BioInfer corpus in the Stanford scheme by ap-
plying the conversion rules and manually correcting
the errors. By making the BioInfer corpus available
in the Stanford scheme, we also increase the value
of the corpus for biomedical IE. The transforma-
tion has the further benefit of allowing Link Gram-
mar output to be normalized into a more application-
oriented form. Finally, to assess the practical value
of the conversion method and of the BioInfer syntac-
tic annotation in the Stanford scheme, we compare
the Charniak-Lease constituency parser2 (Charniak
and Lease, 2005) and BioLG,3 an adaptation of LG
(Pyysalo et al., 2006), on the newly unified dataset
combining the constituency-annotated GENIA Tree-
bank with the dependency-annotated BioInfer cor-
pus.

the Stanford annotation of the BioInfer corpus, the

2 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955636363636">
To support the development of IE systems, it is im-
portant for a corpus to provide three key types of
annotation capturing the named entities, their rela-
tionships and the syntax. To our knowledge, there
are only two corpora in the biomedical domain that
currently provide these three annotation types simul-
taneously, BioInfer and LLL (Aubin, 2005). In ad-
dition, GENIA, the de facto standard domain corpus
for named entity recognition and syntactic analysis,
is in the process of adding a relationship annota-
tion. The corpora have different strengths; BioInfer
provides a detailed relationship annotation, while
GENIA has a broader coverage of named entities
and a larger treebank. Unifying the syntactic anno-
tations of these two corpora allows these strengths
to be combined.
The BioInfer syntactic annotation follows the LG
dependency scheme, addressing the recent interest
in LG in the biomedical NLP community (Ding et
al., 2003; Alphonse et al., 2004; Aubin et al., 2005).
However, the LG scheme has been criticized for be-
ing oriented more towards structural than semantic

relations and having excessively detailed link types
whose functional meaning and value for semantic
analysis is questionable (Schneider, 1998; de Marn-
effe et al., 2006). Our experience with LG leads us
to largely agree with these criticisms.
De Marneffe et al. (2006) have recently intro-
duced a transformation from PTB to the Stanford
scheme. Clegg and Shepherd (2007) have ap-
plied this transformation to perform a dependency-
based comparison of several statistical constituency
parsers on the GENIA Treebank and have argued for
the adoption of the Stanford scheme in biomedical
IE. Moreover, the IE system of Fundel et al. (2007),
which employs the Stanford scheme, was shown to
notably outperform previously applied systems on
the LLL challenge dataset, finding an F-score of
72% against a previous best of 54%. This further
demonstrates the suitability of the Stanford scheme
to IE applications.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999658952380952">
A parse in the Stanford scheme (SF) is a directed
graph where the nodes correspond to the words and
the edges correspond to pairwise syntactic depen-
dencies between the words. The scheme defines
a hierarchy of 48 grammatical relations, or depen-
dency types. The most generic relation, dependent,
can be specialized as auxiliary, argument, or modi-
fier, which again have several subtypes (de Marneffe
et al., 2006).
The Stanford conversion transforms phrase struc-
ture parses into the Stanford scheme. First, the se-
mantic head of each constituent is identified using
head rules similar to those of Collins (1999) and un-
typed dependencies are then extracted and labeled
with the most specific grammatical relations possi-
ble using Tregex rules (Levy and Andrew, 2006).
The system additionally provides a set of collaps-
ing rules, suggested to be beneficial for IE appli-
cations (de Marneffe et al., 2006; Clegg and Shep-
herd, 2007). These rules collapse some dependen-
cies by incorporating certain parts of speech (mostly

tions. This is realized by combining two relations
and denominating the resulting dependency with a
type based on the word to which the original two
relations were linked (see Figure 1).
In the LG-SF conversion, we target the uncol-
lapsed Stanford scheme, as the collapsing rules have
already been developed and reported by de Marn-
effe et al.; reimplementing the collapsing would be
an unnecessary duplication of efforts. Also, the col-
lapsed relations can be easily created based on the
uncollapsed ones, whereas reversing the conversion
would be more complicated.

3.2 LG dependency scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999595">
Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley, 1993) is
closely related to dependency formalisms. It is
based on the notion of typed links connecting words.
While links are not explicitly directional, the roles
of the words can be inferred from their left-to-right
order and the link type. An LG parse, termed link-
age, consists of a set of links that connect the words
so that no two links cross or connect the same two
words. When discussing LG, we will use the terms
dependency and link interchangeably.
Compared to the 48 dependency types of the Stan-
ford scheme, the LG English grammar defines over
100 main link types which are further divided into
400 subtypes. The unusually high number of dis-
tinct types is one of the properties of the LG English
grammar that complicate the application of LG in
information extraction. Consider, for instance, the
case of prepositional phrase attachment illustrated in
Figure 2, where all the alternative attachment struc-
tures receive different types. Arguably, this distinc-
tion is unimportant to current IE systems and there-
fore should be normalized. This normalization is in-
herent in the Stanford scheme, where the preposition
always attaches using a prep dependency.
In contrast to such unnecessarily detailed distinc-
tions, in certain cases LG types fail to make seman-
tically important distinctions. For instance, the CO
link type is used to mark almost all clause openers,
not distinguishing between, for example, adverbial
and prepositional openers.

4.1 LG-SF conversion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942888888889">
The LG-SF conversion transforms the undirected
LG links into directed dependencies that follow the
Stanford scheme. The transformation is based on
handwritten rules, each rule consisting of a pattern
that is matched in the LG linkage and generating a
single dependency in the Stanford parse. Since the
conversion rules only refer to the LG linkage, they
do not influence each other and are applied inde-
pendently in an arbitrary order. The pattern of each
rule is expressed as a set of positive or negative con-
straints on the presence of LG links. The constraints
typically restrict the link types and may also refer to
the lexical level, restricting only to links connecting
certain word forms. Since LG does not define link
directionality, the patterns refer to the left-to-right
order of tokens and the rules must explicitly specify
the directionality of the generated SF dependencies.
As an example, let us consider the rule
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.626383">
[X —Pv Y] ⇒Y auxpass
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9860505">
→ X. The pattern matches two
tokens connected with an LG link of type Pv and
generates the corresponding directed auxpass de-
pendency. This rule applies twice in the linkage
in Figure 1. It is an example of a rare case of a
one-to-one correspondence between an LG and an
SF type. Many-to-many correspondences are much
more common: in these cases, rules specify multiple
restrictions and multiple rules are needed to gener-
ate all instances of a particular dependency type. As
a further example, we present the three rules below,
which together generate all left-to-right prep depen-
dencies. An exclamation mark in front of a restric-
tion denotes a negative restriction, i.e., the link must
not exist in order for the rule to apply. The link types
are specified as regular expressions.

order of the first two tokens cannot be resolved by
the rules.
To resolve coordination structures, it is crucial to
recognize the leftmost coordinated element, i.e. the
head of the coordination structure in the SF scheme.
However, the conversion rule patterns are unable to
capture general constraints on the relative order of
the tokens. For instance, in the linkage in Figure 3, it
is not possible to devise a pattern only matching one
of the tokens actin and profilin, while not matching
the other. Therefore, we perform a pre-processing
step to resolve the coordination structures prior to
the application of the conversion rules. After the
pre-processing, the conversion is performed with the
lp2lp software (Alphonse et al., 2004), previously
used to transform LG into the LLL competition for-
mat (Aubin, 2005).
In the development of the LG-SF conversion and
SF BioInfer, we make the following minor modifi-
cations to the Stanford scheme. The scheme dis-
tinguishes nominal and adjectival pre-modifiers of
nouns, a distinction that is not preserved in the
BioInfer corpus. Therefore, we merge the nom-
inal and adjectival pre-modifier grammatical rela-
tions into a single relation, nmod. For the same rea-
son, we do not distinguish between apposition and
abbreviation, and only use the appos dependency
type. Finally, we do not annotate punctuation.
Schneider (1998) has previously proposed a strat-
egy for identifying the head word for each LG link,
imposing directionality and thus obtaining a depen-
dency graph. Given the idiosyncrasies of the LG
linkage structures, this type of transformation into
dependency would clearly not have many of the nor-
malizing benefits of the LG-SF transformation.

For creating the BioInfer corpus syntactic annota-

the annotation process was the existing manual an-
notation of the corpus in the LG scheme to which
we applied the LG-SF conversion described in Sec-
tion 4.1. The resulting SF parses were then manu-

ally corrected by four annotators. In the manual cor-
rection phase, each sentence was double-annotated,
that is, two annotators corrected the converted out-
put independently. All disagreements were resolved
jointly by all annotators.
To estimate the annotation quality and the sta-
bility of the SF scheme, we determined annotator
agreement as precision and recall measured against
the final annotation. The average annotation preci-
sion and recall were 97.5% and 97.4%, respectively.
This high agreement rate suggests that the task was
well-defined and the annotation scheme is stable.
The BioInfer corpus consists of 1100 sentences
and, on average, the annotation consumed approxi-
mately 10 minutes per sentence in total.

5.1 Evaluation of the conversion rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996075">
In the evaluation of the conversion rules against the
gold standard SF BioInfer annotation, we find a pre-
cision of 98.0% and a recall of 96.2%. Currently,
the LG-SF conversion consists of 114 rules, each
of which specifies, on average, 4.4 restrictions. Al-
together the rules currently generate 32 SF depen-
dency types, thus averaging 3.5 rules per SF type.
Only 9 of the SF types are generated by a single
rule, while the remaining require several rules. We
estimate that the current ruleset required about 100
hours to develop.
In Figure 4, we show the cumulative precision and
recall of the rules when added in the descending or-
der of their recall. Remarkably, we find that a recall
of 80% is reached with just 13 conversion rules, 90%
with 28 rules, and 95% with 56 rules. These fig-
ures demonstrate that while the SF and LG schemes
are substantially different, a high-recall conversion
can be obtained with approximately fifty carefully
crafted rules. Additionally, while precision is con-
sistently high, the highest-recall rules also have the
highest precision. This may be related to the fact
that the most common SF dependency types have a
straightforward correspondence in LG types.

A common source of errors in the LG-SF conver-
sion are the Link Grammar idiomatic expressions,
which are analyzed as a chain of ID links (0.7% of
all links in the BioInfer corpus) and connected to
the linkage always through their last word. Some
examples of LG idiomatic expressions include each
other, no one, come of age, gotten rid of, for good,
and the like. These expressions are often problem-
atic in the SF conversion as well. We did not at-
tempt any wide-coverage systematic resolution of
the idiomatic expressions and, apart from the most
common cases such as in vitro, we preserve the LG
structure of connecting these expressions through
their last word. We note, however, that the list of
idiomatic LG expressions is closed and therefore a
case-by-case resolution leading to a full coverage is
possible, although not necessarily practical.
Similar to the LG idiomatic expressions are the
SF dep dependencies, generated when none of the
SF rules assigns a more specific type. In most cases,
dep is a result of a lack of coverage of the SF con-
version rules typically occurring in rare or idiomatic
expressions. We assume that many of the dep depen-
dencies will be resolved in the future, given that the
SF conversion and the SF dependency scheme itself
are presented by the authors as a work in progress.
Therefore, we do not attempt to replicate most of
the SF dep dependencies with the LG-SF conversion
rules; much of the effort would be obsoleted by the
progress of the SF conversion. The dep dependen-
cies account for 23% of the total 3.8% of dependen-
cies not recovered by the LG-SF conversion.

<bodyText confidence="0.999975903225807">
The Charniak-Lease parser is a statisti-
cal constituency parser developed by Char-
niak and Lease (2005). It is an adaptation of the
Charniak parser (Charniak, 1999) to the biomedical
domain. For example, it uses a POS-tagger trained
on the GENIA corpus, although the parser itself has
been trained on the Penn Treebank. The Charniak-
Lease parser is of particular interest, because in a
recent comparison performed by Clegg and Shep-
herd (2007) on the GENIA Treebank, it was the
best performing of several state-of-the-art statistical
constituency parsers.
The LG parser is a rule-based dependency parser
with a broad coverage grammar of newspaper-type
English. It has no probabilistic component and does
not perform pruning of ambiguous alternatives dur-
ing parsing. Instead, the parser generates all parses
accepted by the grammar. Simple heuristics are ap-
plied to rank the alternative parses.
Here, we evaluate a recently introduced adap-
tation of LG to the biomedical domain, BioLG
(Pyysalo et al., 2006), incorporating the GENIA
POS tagger (Tsuruoka et al., 2005) as well as a num-
ber of modifications to lexical processing and the
grammar.
To facilitate the comparison of results with those
of Clegg and Shepherd, we use their modified subset
of GENIA Treebank.4 As 600 of the 1100 BioInfer
sentences have previously been used in the develop-
ment of the BioLG parser, we only use the remaining
500 blind sentences of BioInfer in the evaluation.

standard dependencies. The matching criterion re-
quired that the correct words are connected and
that the direction and type of the dependency are
correct. The dependency-based evaluation results
for the Charniak-Lease and BioLG parsers on the
GENIA and BioInfer corpora are shown in Table 1.
We note that Clegg and Shepherd (2007) report
77% F-score performance of Charniak-Lease on the
GENIA corpus, using the collapsed variant of the SF
scheme. We replicated their experiment using the
uncollapsed variant and found an F-score of 80%.
Therefore, most of the approximately 4% difference
compared to our finding reported in Table 1 is due
to this difference in the use of collapsing, with our
modifications to the SF scheme having a lesser ef-
fect. The decrease in measured performance caused
by the collapsing is, however, mostly an artifact
caused by merging several dependencies into one; a
single mistake of the parser can have a larger effect
on the performance measurement.
We find that while the performance of the
Charniak-Lease parser is approximately 2 percent-
age units better on GENIA than on BioInfer, for
BioLG we find the opposite effect, with performance
approximately 3 percentage units better on BioInfer.
Thus, both parsers perform better on the corpora
closer to their native scheme. We estimate that this
total 5 percentage unit divergence represents an up-
per limit to the evaluation bias introduced by the two
sets of conversion rules. We discuss the possible
causes for this divergence in Section 5.4.

two parsers on the two corpora were statistically
significant, we used the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test
for F-score performance using the Bonferroni cor-
rection for multiple comparisons (N = 2), follow-
ing the recent recommendation of Demˇsar (2006).
We find that the Charniak-Lease parser outperforms
BioLG statistically significantly on both the GENIA
corpus (p ≪ 0.01) and on the BioInfer corpus

parsers can, in this case, be established even in the
presence of opposing conversion biases on the two
corpora.
In Table 2, we present an evaluation of the BioLG
parser with and without the LG-SF conversion,
specifically evaluating the effect of the conversion
presented in this study. Here we find a substantially
more stable performance, including even an increase
in precision. This further validates the quality of the
conversion rules.
Finally, we note that the processing time required
to perform the conversions is insignificant compared
to the time consumed by the parsers.

5.4 Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953263157895">
Evaluating BioLG on GENIA and the Charniak-
Lease parser on BioInfer includes multiple sources
of divergence. In addition to parser errors, differ-
ences can be created by the LG-SF conversion and
the Stanford conversion. Moreover, in examining
the outputs we identified that a further source of
divergence is due to differing interpretations of the
Stanford scheme. One such difference is illustrated
in Figure 5. Here the BioLG parser with the LG-
SF conversion produces an analysis that differs from
the result of converting the GENIA Treebank analy-
sis by the Stanford conversion. This is due to the
Stanford conversion producing an apparently flawed
analysis that is not replicated by the LG-SF con-
version. In certain cases of this type, the lack of a
detailed definition of the SF scheme prevents from
distinguishing between conversion errors and inten-
tional analyses. This will necessarily lead to differ-
ing interpretations, complicating precise evaluation.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991135135135">
We have presented a step towards unifying syntactic
annotations under the Stanford dependency scheme
and assessed the feasibility of this unification by
developing and evaluating a conversion from Link
Grammar to the Stanford scheme. We find that a
highly reliable transformation can be created, giv-
ing a precision and recall of 98.0% and 96.2%, re-
spectively, when compared against our manually an-
notated gold standard version of the BioInfer cor-
pus. We also find that the performance of the BioLG
parser is not adversely affected by the conversion.
Given the clear benefits that the Stanford scheme
has for domain analysis, the conversion increases the
overall suitability of the parser to IE applications.
Based on these results, we conclude that converting
to the Stanford scheme is both feasible and practical.
Further, we have developed a version of the
BioInfer corpus annotated with the Stanford scheme,
thereby increasing the usability of the corpus. We
applied the LG-SF conversion to the original LG
BioInfer annotation and manually corrected the er-
rors. The high annotator agreement of above 97%
precision and recall confirms the stability of the SF
scheme.
We have also demonstrated that the unification
permits direct parser comparison that was previously
impossible. However, we found that there is a cer-
tain accumulation of errors caused by the conver-
sion, particularly in a case when two distinct rule
sets are applied. In our case, we estimate this error
to be on the order of several percentage units, never-
theless, we were able to establish the relative perfor-
mance of the parses with a strong statistical signif-
icance. These results demonstrate the utility of the
Stanford scheme as a unifying representation of syn-
tax. We note that an authoritative definition of the
Stanford scheme would further increase its value.

To address this complexity, many biomedical IE systems (Alphonse et al., 2004; Rinaldi et al., 2004; Fundel et al., 2007) and annotated corpora (Kim et al., 2003; Aubin, 2005; Pyysalo et al., 2007) incorporate full syntactic analysis. However, there are significant differences between the syntactic annotation schemes employed. This leads to difficulties in sharing data between corpora and establishing the relative performance of parsers as well as to a lack of interchangeability of one parser for another in IE systems, among other issues. Syntax formalisms are broadly divided into constituency and dependency. Constituency schemes are dominant in many fields and are unified under the established Penn Treebank (PTB) scheme (Bies et al., 1995). However, dependency sc</context>

The transformation rules and software as well as the Stanford annotation of the BioInfer corpus, the main practical results of this work, are freely available at http://www.it.utu.fi/BioInfer. 2 Motivation To support the development of IE systems, it is important for a corpus to provide three key types of annotation capturing the named entities, their relationships and the syntax. To our knowledge, there are only two corpora in the biomedical domain that currently provide these three annotation types simultaneously, BioInfer and LLL (Aubin, 2005). In addition, GENIA, the de facto standard domain corpus for named entity recognition and syntactic analysis, is in the process of adding a relationship annotation. The corpora have different strengths; BioInfer provides a detailed relationship annotation, while GENIA has a broader coverage of named entities and a larger treebank. Unifying the syntactic annotations of these two corpora allows these strengths to be combined. The BioInfer syntactic annotation follows the LG dependency scheme, addressing the recent interest in LG in the biomedical NLP community (Ding et al., 2003; Alphonse et al</context>
<context position="14370" citStr="Aubin, 2005" startWordPosition="2282" endWordPosition="2283"> in the SF scheme. However, the conversion rule patterns are unable to capture general constraints on the relative order of the tokens. For instance, in the linkage in Figure 3, it is not possible to devise a pattern only matching one of the tokens actin and profilin, while not matching the other. Therefore, we perform a pre-processing step to resolve the coordination structures prior to the application of the conversion rules. After the pre-processing, the conversion is performed with the lp2lp software (Alphonse et al., 2004), previously used to transform LG into the LLL competition format (Aubin, 2005). In the development of the LG-SF conversion and SF BioInfer, we make the following minor modifications to the Stanford scheme. The scheme distinguishes nominal and adjectival pre-modifiers of nouns, a distinction that is not preserved in the BioInfer corpus. Therefore, we merge the nominal and adjectival pre-modifier grammatical relations into a single relation, nmod. For the same reason, we do not distinguish between apposition and abbreviation, and only use the appos dependency type. Finally, we do not annotate punctuation.

Further, Lin (1998) argues for dependency-based evaluation of both dependency and constituency parsers since it allows evaluation metrics that are more relevant to semantic interpretation as well as intuitively more meaningful.

By making the BioInfer corpus available in the Stanford scheme, we also increase the value of the corpus for biomedical IE. The transformation has the further benefit of allowing Link Grammar output to be normalized into a more applicationoriented form.

In this paper, we present a step towards unifying the diverse syntax schemes in use in IE systems and corpora such as the GENIA Treebank1 and the recently introduced BioInfer corpus (Pyysalo et al., 2007). Clegg and Shepherd (2007) have recently proposed to use the Stanford dependency scheme (de Marneffe et al., 2006) as a common, application-oriented syntax representation. To assess this choice, we develop a set of conversion rules for transforming the Link Grammar (LG) dependency scheme (Sleator and Temperley, 1993) to 1http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ —genia 25 BioNLP 2007: Biological, translational, and clinical language processing, pages 25–32, Prague, June 2007. c�2007 Association for Computational Linguistics the Stanford scheme and then create a version of the BioInfer corpus in the Stanford scheme by apply</context>

However, the LG scheme has been criticized for being oriented more towards structural than semantic 2http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/, version 1.5.1 3http://www.it.utu.fi/BioLG, version 1.2.0 relations and having excessively detailed link types whose functional meaning and value for semantic analysis is questionable (Schneider, 1998; de Marneffe et al., 2006). Our experience with LG leads us to largely agree with these criticisms. De Marneffe et al. (2006) have recently introduced a transformation from PTB to the Stanford scheme. Clegg and Shepherd (2007) have applied this transformation to perform a dependencybased comparison of several statistical constituency parsers on the GENIA Treebank and have argued for the adoption of the Stanford scheme in biomedical IE. Moreover, the IE system of Fundel et al.

It is an adaptation of the Charniak parser (Charniak, 1999) to the biomedical domain. For example, it uses a POS-tagger trained on the GENIA corpus, although the parser itself has been trained on the Penn Treebank. The CharniakLease parser is of particular interest, because in a recent comparison performed by Clegg and Shepherd (2007) on the GENIA Treebank, it was the best performing of several state-of-the-art statistical constituency parsers. The LG parser is a rule-based dependency parser with a broad coverage grammar of newspaper-type English. It has no probabilistic component and does not perform pruning of ambiguous alternatives during parsing. Instead, the parser generates all parses accepted by the grammar. Simple heuristics are applied to rank the alternative parses. Here, we evaluate a recently introduced adaptation of LG to the biomedical domain, BioLG (Pyysalo et al., 2006), incorporating the GENIA POS tagger (</context>

The matching criterion required that the correct words are connected and that the direction and type of the dependency are correct. The dependency-based evaluation results for the Charniak-Lease and BioLG parsers on the GENIA and BioInfer corpora are shown in Table 1. We note that Clegg and Shepherd (2007) report 77% F-score performance of Charniak-Lease on the GENIA corpus, using the collapsed variant of the SF scheme. We replicated their experiment using the uncollapsed variant and found an F-score of 80%. Therefore, most of the approximately 4% difference compared to our finding reported in Table 1 is due to this difference in the use of collapsing, with our modifications to the SF scheme having a lesser effect. The decrease in measured performance caused by the collapsing is, however, mostly an artifact caused by merging several dependencies into one; a single mistake of the parser can have</context>

The corpora have different strengths; BioInfer provides a detailed relationship annotation, while GENIA has a broader coverage of named entities and a larger treebank. Unifying the syntactic annotations of these two corpora allows these strengths to be combined.

Syntax formalisms are broadly divided into constituency and dependency. Constituency schemes are dominant in many fields and are unified under the established Penn Treebank (PTB) scheme (Bies et al., 1995). However, dependency schemes have been suggested to be preferable in IE, as they represent the semantic structure of the sentences more directly (see, e.g., de Marneffe et al. (2006)). Further, Lin (1998) argues for dependency-based evaluation of both dependency and constituency parsers since it allows evaluation metrics that are more relevant to semantic interpretation as well as intuitively more meaningful. Even though there is clearly a need for a unifying scheme for dependency comparable to that of PTB for constituency, no widely adopted standard currently exists.

In the development of the LG-SF conversion and SF BioInfer, we make the following minor modifications to the Stanford scheme. The scheme distinguishes nominal and adjectival pre-modifiers of nouns, a distinction that is not preserved in the BioInfer corpus. Therefore, we merge the nominal and adjectival pre-modifier grammatical relations into a single relation, nmod. For the same reason, we do not distinguish between apposition and abbreviation, and only use the appos dependency type. Finally, we do not annotate punctuation. Schneider (1998) has previously proposed a strategy for identifying the head word for each LG link, imposing directionality and thus obtaining a dependency graph. Given the idiosyncrasies of the LG linkage structures, this type of transformation into dependency would clearly not have many of the normalizing benefits of the LG-SF transformation. 4.2 SF BioInfer For creating the BioInfer corpus syntactic annotation in the Stanford scheme, the starting point of the annotation process was the existing manual annotation of the corpus in the LG scheme to which we applied the LG-SF conversion described in Section 4.</context>

The transformation has the further benefit of allowing Link Grammar output to be normalized into a more app</context>

This is realized by combining two relations and denominating the resulting dependency with a type based on the word to which the original two relations were linked (see Figure 1). In the LG-SF conversion, we target the uncollapsed Stanford scheme, as the collapsing rules have already been developed and reported by de Marneffe et al.; reimplementing the collapsing would be an unnecessary duplication of efforts. Also, the collapsed relations can be easily created based on the uncollapsed ones, whereas reversing the conversion would be more complicated. 3.2 LG dependency scheme Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley, 1993) is closely related to dependency formalisms. It is based on the notion of typed links connecting words. While links are not explicitly directional, the roles of the words can be inferred from their left-to-right order and the link type. An LG parse, termed linkage, consists of a set of links that connect the words so that no two links cross or connect the same two words. When discussing LG, we will use the terms dependency and link interchangeably. Compared to the 48 dependency types of the Stanford scheme, the LG English grammar defines over 100 main link types which are further divided into</context>
