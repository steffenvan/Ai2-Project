Preface

<bodyText confidence="0.998241">
Information access and exchange play a major role in our globalized world. Hence, building resources
(lexica, thesauri, ontologies or annotated corpora) and providing access to words become an important
goal. The lexicon is a vital resource for building applications. It is also a crucial element in the study
of human language processing.
The spirit of this workshop multidisciplinary, the goal being to gather experts with various backgrounds
and to allow them to exchange ideas, to compare their methodologies and theoretical perspectives, to
create synergy, and to encourage future collaborations. In sum, the participants will be discussing
questions concerning the cognitive aspects of the lexicon, and their answers should guide the design of
on-line dictionaries.
While completeness is a virtue, the quality of a dictionary depends not only on coverage (number of
entries) and granularity, but also on accessibility of information. Access strategies vary with the task
(text understanding vs. text production) and the knowledge available at the moment of consultation
(word, concept, sound). Unlike readers, who look for meanings, writers start from them, searching
for the ’right’ words. While paper dictionaries are static, permitting only limited strategies for
accessing information, their electronic counterparts promise dynamic, proactive search via multiple
criteria (meaning, sound, related word) and via diverse access routes. Navigation takes place in a huge
conceptual-lexical space, and the results are displayable in a multitude of forms (as trees, as lists, as
graphs, or sorted alphabetically, by topic, by frequency).
Many lexicographers work nowadays with huge digital corpora, using language technology to build
and to maintain the resource. But access to the potential wealth in dictionaries remains limited for the
common user. Yet, the new possibilities of electronic media in terms of comfort, speed and flexibility
(multiple inputs, polymorph outputs) are enormous and probably beyond our imagination. More
than just allowing electronic versions of paper-bound dictionaries, computers provide a freedom for
rethinking dictionaries, thesauri, encyclopedia, etc., a distinction necessary in the past for economical
reasons, but not justified anymore.
The goal of this workshop is to perform the groundwork for the next generation of electronic
dictionaries, that is, to study the possibility of integrating the different resources, as well as to explore
the feasibility of taking the users’ needs, knowledge and access strategies into account.
To reach this goal we have asked authors to address one or more of the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.90007248">
1. Conceptual input of a dictionary user: what is present in speaker’s/writer’s minds when they
are generating a message and looking for a (target) word? Does the user have in mind conceptual
primitives, semantically related words, some type of partial definition, something like synsets, or
something completely different?
2. Access, navigation and search strategies: how can search be supported by taking into account
prior, i.e. available knowledge? Entries should be accessible in many ways: by word forms,
by meaning, by sounds (syllables), or in a combined form, and this even if input is given in
an incomplete, imprecise or degraded form. The more precise the conceptual input, the less
iii
navigation should be needed and vice versa. How can we create manageable search spaces, and
provide a user with the tools for navigating within them?
3. Indexing words and organizing the lexicon: Words and concepts can be organized in
many ways, varying according to typology and conceptual systems. For example, words are
traditionally organized alphabetically in Western languages, but by semantic radicals and stroke
counts in Chinese. The way words and concepts are organized affects indexing and access.
Indexing must robustly allow for multiple ways of navigation and access. What efficient
organizational principles allow the greatest flexibility for access? What about lexical entry
standardization? Are universal definitions possible? What about efforts such as the Lexical
Markup Framework (LMF) and other global structures for the lexicon? Can ontologies be
combined with standards for the lexicon?
4. NLP Applications: Contributors can also address the issue of how such enhanced dictionaries,
once embedded in existing NLP applications, can boost performance and help solve lexical
and textual-entailment problems such as those evaluated in SEMEVAL 2007, or, more
generally, generation problems encountered in the context of summarization, question-answering,
interactive paraphrasing or translation.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998936875">
We’ve received 18 papers, of which 6 were accepted as full papers, while 8 were chosen as poster
presentations. While we did not get papers on all the issues mentioned in our call, we did get a quite
rich panel on ideas as divers as use of ontologies; sense extraction; computation of associative responses
to multi-word stimuli; saliency relations; lexical relationships within collocations and word association
norms; cognitive organization of dictionaries; user-adapted views on a lexicographic database; access
based on conceptual input; search in onomasiological dictionaries, access based on underspecified
input; dictionary use for authoring aids or MT, use of feature vectors, corpora and machine learning,
etc..
It was also interesting to see the variety of languages in which these issues are addressed. The proposals
range from Japanese, English, German, Russian, Dutch, Bulgarian, Romanian, Spanish, to French and
Chinese. In sum, the community working on dictionaries is dynamic, and there seems to be a growing
awareness of the importance of some of the problems presented in our call for papers.
We would like to express here our sincerest thanks to all the specialists who have assisted us to assure
a good selection of papers, despite the very tight schedule. Their reviews were helpful not only for us
as decision makers, but also for the authors, helping them to improve their work. In the hope that the
results will inspire you, provoke fruitful discussions and result in future collaborations.
