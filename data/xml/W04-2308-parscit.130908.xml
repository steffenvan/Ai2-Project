Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999554777777778">
The paper gives an overview of repair se-
quences used in Estonian spoken information
dialogues. 62 calls for information, travel bu-
reaus, shops or outpatients’ departments are
analysed. Several repair types are considered.
Our further aim is to develop a dialogue sys-
tem which can interact with the user in Esto-
nian following the norms and rules of human-
human communication

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9921730625">
Our goal is to build a dialogue system that would be
able to interact with humans in Estonian using norms
and rules of human-human communication. Human-
human communication is not fluent, problems that
must be solved arise continuously. Similar problems
occur in human-computer interaction.
Several branches of linguistics study how to solve
communication problems: discourse analysis, psy-
cholinguistics, foreign language learning, conversa-
tion analysis, dialogue modelling on the computer
and determining dialogue acts (Allen, Core, 1997;
Linell, 1998; Bunt, 1999; Traum, 1999; Allwood et
al. 2001; O&apos;Brien, 2002). Similar phenomena are
called differently: structure shifts, feedback, ground-
ing, repair, communication strategies. There are at
least the following difficulties with these treatments:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99738675">
1) repair is considered together with other dia-
logue management acts and not as a separate phe-
nomenon as it is in natural conversation
2) different means of repair are considered instead
of repair as a process and sequence
3) non-natural utterances are used in dialogue sys-
tems for repairs (To Paris, is that correct? / I don&apos;t
quite understand )
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999067125">
To overcome these problems, we analyse repair
using the methods of the conversation analysis (Sche-
gloff et al 1977). There are 4 kinds of repairs differ-
enced in CA: self-initiated self-repair, other-initiated
self-repair, self-initiated other-repair, other-initiated
other-repair. All the repairs analyzed in this paper are
other-initiated self-repairs. We differentiate three
subtypes here: clarification (45 cases), non-
understanding (7), and reformulation (27).
We have analyzed calls for information (asking
phone numbers, addresses etc.), and calls to travel
bureaus, shops and outpatients&apos; departments. The
analysed sub-corpus consists of 62 dialogues; 2472
dialogue act tags were used in our sub-corpus, among
them 79 repair initiations (about dialogue acts see
Hennoste et al 2003).

2 Other-Initiated Self-Repair
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999790625">
In the case of clarification and non-understanding the
hearer initiates the repair and the partner solves the
problem. Non-understanding means that hearer didn’t
hear or didn’t understand something in speaker’s
previous utterance. There are two main possibilities
to initiate repair: general question which only indi-
cates that there was a problem (e.g. mida/what, kui-
das/pardon), or wh-questions to localise the problem
exactly. The problem is solved by repeating, elaborat-
ing or explicating the problematic information.
In our dialogues, the non-understanding is initi-
ated mostly to indicate non-hearing (6 examples from
7) by using general questions kuidas/ pardon or ut-
terance ei kuule/I don&apos;t hear. The problem is solved
by repeating the problematic information, either ex-
actly or with modifications.1
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.7022475">
1 In examples, the participants are C (client) and O (infor-
mation officer). Simplified transcription is used (see Ap-
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.923839229166667">
C: aga kallis see t66luba on. (0.5)
how much does this work permit cost
&gt;O: kuidas |PPE: NON-UNDERSTANDING|
pardon
&gt;C: kallis t66luba on. |PPJ: RE-
PAIR|
how much does the work permit cost
O: ei, t6- t66luba ei ole vaja.
no work permit is needed
Clarification means that hearer is not sure whether
she has understood some partner’s utterance cor-
rectly. Repeating of the problematic part of utterance
+ tag-question particle (e.g. jah/yes) are used to initi-
ate the repair. The problem is solved by agreeing
with it or rejecting it.
Clarification is initiated in two ways in our data:
- a phrase or declarative sentence that repeats the
problematic part (70%)
- the same + a question-particle jah/yes, vä/or,
ühesõnaga / in short (23%).
The problems are solved mostly by using
- jah, jaa /yes, mhmh (60%)
- the same + repeating or adjusting the previous turn
(12%).
O: nii on pakkuda (0.5) kümme kaks-
kümend.(.)
I can propose (0.5) ten twenty
&gt;C: kümme kakskümend. |PPE: CLARI-
FICATION|
ten twenty
&gt;O: jah. |PPJ: REPAIR|
yes
In reformulation the hearer initiates the repair and
suggests her own interpretation of the problematic
issue. The partner agrees with it or rejects this inter-
pretation. The most frequent ways for repair initiation
are:
- word, phrase, sentence (22% of cases)
- the same + a questioning particle siis/then, jah/ yes,
eks/eh, vä/or (30%)
- et/that, tähendab/it means that + word, phrase, sen-
tence (33%).
The problem is solved by
- jah, jaa / yes, mhmh / yes (41%)
- jah, jaa / yes + repeat or explanation (33%)
- explanation (22%).

3 The Structure of Repair Sequence
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999336">
3.1 Prototypical Repair Sequences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996318857142857">
In the prototype case, the client asks and the officer
answers in information dialogues (the roles can be
reversed in some cases, e.g. when the officer asks
client&apos;s personal data). There are two prototypical
locations of repair sequence: after client’s ques-
tion/request and officer’s answer. They give us two
prototypical repair sequences.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.98148225">
A. Problem in question/request
MAIN LINE: question/request of the client
REPAIR SEQUENCE:
&gt; Repair initiation by officer
&gt; Problem solving by client
BACK TO MAIN LINE: officer&apos;s answer
B. Problem in answer
MAIN LINE: officer&apos;s answer

<equation confidence="0.6783215">
ahah / jah) + (new) question / request / finishing con-
versation
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997780857142857">
69% of repairs that concern question/request belong
to prototype A. This forms 14% from all repairs. 44%
of repairs regarding answer belong to prototype B.
This makes up 27% of all the repairs (75% of them
are clarifications). In sum, 71% of non-under-
standings, 40% clarifications and 33% reformulations
are prototypical.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999712">
3.2 Untypical Repair Sequences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9898605">
First, there exist peripheral variants of prototypical
repair structures. The remaining examples in group A
do not constitute clear sub-groups. In group B there
are some more clearly deviating repair sub-groups.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.4689865">
1. A participant initiates repair regarding information
in some earlier turn.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.968806865384616">
Repairs are initiated regarding the immediately
previous turn in 90% of cases, but there are some
examples, where client clarifies information which
(s)he got earlier in the conversation and breaks the
process of giving information by consultant, as in the
following example. After repair C gives response by
continuer mhmh. Only after this O continues to give
information.
O: kolmkümmend viis ruutmeetrit
dushsh on seal olemas, (.) mõõturid
on seal olemas (1.0) [korras]
it has got thirty five square me-
ters, a shower, it has got water
meters [in order]
&gt;C: [ja tuhat kolmsada.] |PPE: CLA-
RIFICATION|
[and one thousand three hundred]
&gt;O: jah. (.) |PPJ: REPAIR|
yes
C: mhmh
mhmh
O: elektri boiler on seal olemas,
(0.5) ja ta on tühi.
it has got a boiler (0.5) and it&apos;s
empty
The structure is as follows:
O giving information
&gt;C repair initiation regarding earlier information
&gt;O problem solving
C continuer mhmh
O continues giving information
2. The answerer/consultant returns to the main line,
not the client, as it is in prototypical B type repair.
For example, the client initiates a repair regarding
the beginning of an e-mail address and breaks the
officer&apos;s dictation of the address. In this case, the of-
ficer (O) must return to the main line, not the client
(C). There are two possibilities to do this:
- O carries out a repair and continues giving informa-
tion in the same turn
- O carries out a repair, C gives back the turn using
particle mhmh and O continues to give information.
Therefore, there are two structures:
O giving information
&gt;C initiation of repair
&gt;O problem solving + continuation of giving infor-
mation
O giving information
&gt;C initiation of repair
&gt;O problem solving
C mhmh
O continuation of giving information
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8911095">
3. Some turns are added after the repair before return-
ing to the main line (8 cases).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.899404823529412">
The problem is that officer believes that his/her
answer given before repair initiation was finished,
but client does not. So the client does not return to
the main line after problem solving but sends the turn
back by using jah/yes or mhmh/yes. Then the officer
sends turn back again and only after that the client
returns to the main line. The structure is as follows:
O: answer (giving information)
&gt;C: initiation of repair
&gt;O: problem solving
C: jah / mhmh
O: jah / mhmh / adjusting or repeat
C: (mhmh +) new question / finishing conversation /
adjusting or justifying the request
Second, there are some repair sequences with re-
versed roles - the officer asks questions and the client
answers.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.940017">
4. Simple structures with reversed roles
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.937855532258064">
Such repairs occur first of all at the end of conversa-
tion where the client and the officer negotiate the
next meeting and the officer asks client&apos;s address or
phone number. Two types occurred.
First, conversation continues with reversed roles
after repair, the officer asks a new question:
C giving information
&gt;O initiation of repair
&gt;C problem solving
O repeat + new question
O: ä (.) kes te olete.
what&apos;s your name
C: ja nimi on Saabas. (.)
and the name is Saabas
&gt;O: Saabas jah? |PPE: CLARIFICA-
TION|
Saabas yes
&gt;C: jah. (.) |PPJ: REPAIR|
yes
O: Saabas. a ku- kus te asute (0.8)
see on Tartus jah?
Saabas. where do you live (0.8) it
is in Tartu yes?
Second, officer wants to return to normal roles and
gives the turn back to client using the particle mhmh
or repeating earlier information:
C giving information
&gt;O initiation of repair
&gt;C problem solving
O mhmh /repeat
C new question / finishing conversation
O: ja nimi on
and the name is
C: Saabas, Arvo. Saabas Arvo
(6.5) ((O writes down the name))
&gt;O: Arvo jah? |PPE: CLARIFICATION|
Arvo yes
&gt;C: jah. |PPJ: REPAIR|
yes
O: teeme siis nimodi et kümme kaks-
kümend. (0.5)|
let&apos;s do so that (let’s meet) at
ten twenty
C: aitäh?
thank you
5. The second group are sequences where officer
cannot answer the client’s question immediately but
needs some additional information (6 examples). So
he/she uses one or two adjusting questions at first and
then initiates repair. Client solves the problem. And
then the answer to the client’s question follows. The
structure is as follows:
C question / request
(O adjusting conditions of answer)
(C giving information)
O adjusting conditions of answer
C giving information
&gt;O initiation of repair
&gt;C problem solving
(O adjusting conditions of answer)
(C giving information)
O answers to the C&apos;s question/request

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999820625">
We are not able to direct the behaviour of humans
who communicate with the computer. Nevertheless,
we can design our dialogue system in such a way as
to minimize the reasons of repairs by the user. The
primary strategy of the computer would be to provide
clear and exhaustive information so that the need to
clarify or re-formulate would be unnecessary. The
computer itself must initiate repairs to clarify what
information the user wants. The repair mechanism of
the computer that simulates information officer can
be prototypical (type A) because this occurs mostly
in human-human communication.
Our further work will concentrate on the analysis
of a bigger corpus in order to find out and explain
more repair structures which could be modelled in a
dialogue system.

There are at least the following difficulties with these treatments: 1) repair is considered together with other dialogue management acts and not as a separate phenomenon as it is in natural conversation 2) different means of repair are considered instead of repair as a process and sequence 3) non-natural utterances are used in dialogue systems for repairs (To Paris, is that correct? / I don&apos;t quite understand ) To overcome these problems, we analyse repair using the methods of the conversation analysis (Schegloff et al 1977). There are 4 kinds of repairs differenced in CA: self-initiated self-repair, other-initiated self-repair, self-initiated other-repair, other-initiated other-repair. All the repairs analyzed in this paper are other-initiated self-repairs. We differentiate three subtypes here: clarification (45 cases), nonunderstanding (7), and reformulation (27). We have analyzed calls for information (asking phone numbers, addresses etc.), and calls to travel bureaus, shops and outpatients&apos; departments. The analysed sub-corpus consists of 62 dialogues; 2472 dialogue act tags were used in our sub-corpus, among</context>

Humanhuman communication is not fluent, problems that must be solved arise continuously. Similar problems occur in human-computer interaction. Several branches of linguistics study how to solve communication problems: discourse analysis, psycholinguistics, foreign language learning, conversation analysis, dialogue modelling on the computer and determining dialogue acts (Allen, Core, 1997; Linell, 1998; Bunt, 1999; Traum, 1999; Allwood et al. 2001; O&apos;Brien, 2002). Similar phenomena are called differently: structure shifts, feedback, grounding, repair, communication strategies. There are at least the following difficulties with these treatments: 1) repair is considered together with other dialogue management acts and not as a separate phenomenon as it is in natural conversation 2) different means of repair are considered instead of repair as a process and sequence 3) non-natural utterances are used in dialogue systems for repairs (To Paris, is that correct? / I don&apos;t quite understand ) To overcome these problems, we</context>
