Language Weaver has produced a high-
performance statistical Arabic-to-English machine
translation system, based on research work
conducted at the University of Southern California,
Information Sciences Institute (USC/ISI). Getting
resource-unlimited laboratory systems to run in
real time, on a typical desktop Windows machine,
is among Language Weaver’s contributions. The
system is designed to provide broad general
coverage of Arabic news, and is currently used at
various sites within the U.S. Government.
The Arabic-&gt;English translation system to be
demonstrated has been prepared in versions that
require 1 or 2 GB of RAM, and run on a 1.5GHz or
faster processor and translates at a minimum rate
of 500 words per minute. The system includes an
option to trade off speed for quality in the
translation process allowing users to select the
fastest possible gisting-quality output, or the best
possible translation quality for each sentence.
