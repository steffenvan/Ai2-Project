The problem of parsing ambiguous structures
concerns (i) their representation and (ii) the spec-
ification of mechanisms allowing to delay and
control their evaluation. We first propose to use
a particular kind of disjunctions called controlled
disjunctions: these formulae allows the represen-
tation and the implementation of specific con-
straints that can occur between ambiguous val-
ues. But an efficient control of ambiguous struc-
tures also has to take into account lexical as well
as syntactic information concerning this object.
We then propose the use of unary quasi-trees
specifying constraints at these different levels.
The two devices allow an efficient implementa-
tion of the control of the ambiguity. Moreover,
they are independent from a particular formalism

Most of the approaches dealing with ambi-
guity are disambiguating techniques. This
preliminary constatation seems trivial and
relies on a simple presuposition: the am-
biguous structures need to be disambiguated.
However,thisisnottruefromseveralre-
spects.Machinetranslationisagoodex-
ample:theambiguityofasentenceinthe
sourcelanguageneedsveryoftentobepre-
servedandtranslatedintothetargetone(cf.
(Wedekind97)).
Another remark, in the same perspective:
most of the disambiguating techniques rely
on a single linguistic level. In other words,
they generally make use of lexical or syn-
tactic or semantic information, exclusively.
But a natural processing of natural language
shouldnotworkinthisway.Allthelinguis-
ticlevelsofNLP(i.e.phonetic,phonologic,
lexical,syntactic,semanticandpragmatic)
havetobetakenintoaccountatthesame
time. In other words, processing ambigu-
ity would have to be parallel, not sequen-
tial. The problem is then to use ambiguous
structures during the parse without blocking
the analysis. In a first approximation, such a
problem comes to parse using underspecified
structures.Wewillseethatthisconstitutes
apartofthesolution.
The third and last preliminary remark fo-
cuses on the control strategies for the evalu-
ation of ambiguous structures. These strate-
gies can rely on the formal properties of the
ambiguous structure (for example the sim-

We present in this paper a technique called

using the HPSG framework, but it could be
used in all kind of feature-based representa-

This paper is threefold. In a first section,
we present the limits of the classical repre-
sentation of ambiguity and in particular the
technique of named disjunctions. The second
section describes the controlled disjunction
method applied to the lexical level. We de-
scribe in the third section the generalization

2 Ambiguity and Disjunctions
Several techniques have been proposed for
the interpretation and the control of dis-
junctive structures. For example, delay-
ing the evaluation of the disjunctive for-
mulae until obtaining enough information
allows partial disambiguation (cf. (Kart-
tunen84)). Another solution consists in con-
verting the disjunctive formulae into a con-
junctive form (using negation) as proposed
by(Nakazawa88)or(Maxwell91).Wecan
alsomakeuseofthepropertiesofthefor-
mulainordertoeliminateinconsistencies.
This approach, described in (Maxwell91), re-
lies on the conversion of the original disjunc-
tive formulae into a set of contexted con-
straints which allows, by the introduction of
propositional variables (i) to convert the for-
mulae into a conjunctive form, and (ii) to
isolate a subset of formulae, the disjunctive
residue (the negation of the unsatisfiable con-
straints). The problem of the satisfiability of
theinitialformulaisthenreducedtothatof
thedisjunctiveresidue.
This approach is fruitful and several meth-
ods rely on this idea to refer formulae with
an index (a propositional variable, an integer,
etc.). It is the case in particular with named
disjunctions (see (D6rre90), (Krieger93) or
(Gerdemann95)) which propose a compact
representation of control phenomena and co-
variancy.
A named disjunction (noted hereafter ND)
binds several disjunctive formulae with an in-
dex (the name of the disjunction). These for-
mulae have the same arity and their disjuncts
are ordered. They are linked by a covariancy
relation: when one disjunct in a ND is se-
lected (i.e. interpreted to true), then all the
disjunctsoccurringatthesamepositioninto
theotherformulaeoftheNDalsohaveto
betrue.Theexample(1)presentsthelexi-
calentryofthegermandeterminerden.The

<bodyText confidence="0.998040111111111">
But the named disjunction technique also
has some limits. In particular, NDs have to
represent all the relations between formulae
in a covariant way. This leads to a lot of
redundancy and a loss of the compactness
in the sense that the disjuncts don&apos;t contain
anymorethepossiblevaluesbutallthepos-
siblevarianciesaccordingtotheotherformu-
lae.

Some techniques has been proposed in or-
der to eliminate this drawback and in par-
ticular: the dependency group representa-
tion (see (Griffith96)) and the controlled dis-
junctions (see (Blache97)). The former re-
lies on an enrichment of the Maxwell and
Kaplan&apos;s contexted constraints. In this ap-
proach, constraints are composed of the con-
junction of base constraints (corresponding
totheinitialdisjunctiveform)plusacontrol

resentationofcontrolrelationsrelyingona
clear distinction between (i) the possible val-
ues (the disjuncts) and (ii) the relations be-
tween these ambiguous values and other ele-
ments of the structure. This approach allows
a direct implementation of the implication
relations (i.e. the oriented controls) instead
ofsimplecovariancies.

3 Controlled Disjunctions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999719592592592">
The controlled disjunctions (noted hereafter
CD) implement the relations existing be-
tween ambiguous feature values. The exam-
ple of the figure (1) describes a non covariant
relation between GENDER and HEAD features.
More precisely, this relation is oriented: if the
objectisanoun,thenthegenderismascu-
lineandiftheobjectisfeminine,thenitis
anadjective.
The relation between these values can be
represented as implications: noun ==&gt; masc
and f em ==&gt; adj. The main interest of CDs
is the representation of the variancy between
the possible values and the control of this
variancy by complex formulae.
Controlled disjunctions reference the for-
mulae with names and all the formula are
ordered. So, we can refer directly to one of
the disjuncts (or to a set of linked disjuncts)
with the name of the disjunction and its rank.
For clarity, we represent, as in the figure
(2), the consequent of the implication with
a pair indexing the antecedent. This pair
indicates the name of the disjunction and
the rank of the disjunct. In this example,
noun(2�1) implements noun ==&gt; masc: the
pair (2, 1) references the element of the dis-

The example (3)1 presents the case of an
ambiguity that cannot be totally controlled
by a ND. This structure indicates a set of
variancies. But the covariancy representa-
tion only implements a part of the relations.
In fact, several &amp;quot;complex&amp;quot; implications (i.e.
withaconjunctionasantecedent)control
theseformulaeasfollows:
{anc==&gt;f,bnd==&gt;e,cne==&gt;b,dnf==&gt;a}
These implications (the &amp;quot;controlling for-
mulae&amp;quot;) are constraints on the positions of
the disjuncts in the CD. The formula in the
example (4) presents a solution using CDs
and totally implementing all the relations. In
this representation, (i = 1) n (j = 1) =� (k = 2)

From an implementation point of view, the
controlled disjunctions can easily be imple-
mented with languages using delaying de-
vices. An implementation using functions in
Life has been described in (Blache97).

(Vijay-Shanker92) proposes the use of trees
description called quasi-trees whithin the
framework of TAG. Such structures rely on
the generalization of hierarchical relations
between constituents. These trees bear some
particular nodes, called quasi-nodes, which
areconstitutedbyapairofcategoriesofthe

Such an approach is particularly interest-
ing for the description of generalizations.
The basic principle in TAG consists in
preparing subtrees which are part of the final
syntactic structure. These subtrees can be of
a level greater than one: in this case, the tree

example indicates that:

3These objects, as for the quasi-trees, can be con-

<bodyText confidence="0.852936037037037">
As indicated before, each node represents
a disjunctive formula and the set of nodes
constitutes a covariant disjunction. This in-
formation being systematic, it becomes im-
plicit in the representation of the UQTs (i.e.
no names are indicated). So, the position of
avalueintoanodeisrelevantandindicates
therelatedvaluesintothetree.
This kind of representation can be system-
atized to the major categories and we can
propose a set of elementary hierarchies, as
shown in the figure (6) used to construct the
UQTs.
It is interesting to note that the notion of
UQT can have a representation into different
formalisms, even not based on a tree repre-
sentation. The figure (2) shows for example
an HPSG implementation of the UQT de-
scribed in the figure (1).
In this example, we can see that the ambi-
guity is not systematically propagated to all
the levels: at the second level (substructure
2),bothvaluesbelongtoasamefeature
(HEAD-DAUGHTER). The covariation here
concerns different features at different levels.

type of the daughter at the third level. More-
over, we can see that the noun can be pro-
jected into a NP, but this NP can be either a
complement or a subject daughter. This am-
biguity is represented by an embedded vari-
ation (in this case a simple disjunction).
The example described in the figure (3)
shows a french lexical item that can be cat-
egorized as an adjective, a noun or a verb
(resp. translated as ferm, farm or to close).
In comparison with the previous example,
adding the verb subcase simply consists in
adding the corresponding basic tree to the
structure. In this case, the covariant part of
the structure has three subcases.
This kind of representation can be con-
sidered as a description in the sense that it
works as a constraint on the corresponding
syntactic structure.

straintsinordertocontroltheparsingpro-

The example of the figure (4) presents an
ambiguity which &amp;quot;disappears&amp;quot; at the third
level of the UQT. This (uncomplete) NP con-
tains two elements with a classical ambigu-
ity adj/noun. In this case, both combinations
are possible, but the root type is always nom-
inal. This is an example of ambiguous struc-
ture that doesn&apos;t need to be disambiguated
(at least at the syntactic level): the parser
can use directly this structure4.
As seen before, the controlled disjunctions
can represent very precisely different kind of
relations within a structure. Applying this
technique to the UQTs allows the represen-
tation of dynamic relations relying on the
context. Such constraints use the selection

The selection constraints are applied be-

lations are represented by arcs between the
nodes at the lexical level. They indicate the
possibility of cooccurrence of two juxtaposed
categories. The constraints represented by

The interest of this kind of constraints is
that they constitute a local network which

These relations can be seen as constraints

An efficient treatment of the ambiguity re-
lies on the possibility of delaying the eval-
uation of ambiguous structures (i.e. delay-
ing the expansion into a disjunctive normal
form). But such a treatment is efficient if we
can (1) extract as much information as pos-
sible from the context and (2) continue the

<abstract confidence="0.996037166666667">The problem of parsing ambiguous structures their representation and the specification of mechanisms allowing to delay and control their evaluation. We first propose to use particular kind of disjunctions called these formulae allows the representation and the implementation of specific constraints that can occur between ambiguous values. But an efficient control of ambiguous structures also has to take into account lexical as well as syntactic information concerning this object. then propose the use of quasi-trees specifying constraints at these different levels. The two devices allow an efficient implementation of the control of the ambiguity. Moreover, they are independent from a particular formalism andcanbeusedwhateverthelinguistictheory.</abstract>
