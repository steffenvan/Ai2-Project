ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.999637416666667">
The paper presents an algorithm, written in
PROLOG, for processing English sentences which
contain either Gapping, Right Node Raising (RNR)
or Reduced Conjunction (RC). The DCG (Definite
Clause Grammar) formalism (Pereira &amp; Warren 80) is
adopted. The algorithm is highly efficient and
capable of processing a full range of coordinate
constructions containing any number of coordinate
conjunctions (&apos;and&apos;, &apos;or&apos;, and &apos;but&apos;). The
algorithm is part of an English-Chinese machine
translation system which is in the course of
construction.

<bodyText confidence="0.952101057142857">
Theoretical linguists have made a
considerable investigation into coordinate
constructions (Ross 67a, Hankamer 73, Schachter
77, Sag 77, Gazdar 81 and Sobin 82, to name a
few), giving descriptions of the phenomena from
various perspectives. Some of the descriptions are
stimulating or convincing. Computational
linguists, on the other hand, have achieved less
than their theoretical counterparts.
(Woods 73)&apos;s SYSCONJ, to my knowledge, is the
first and the most often referenced facility
designed specifically for coordinate construction
processing. It can get the correct analysis for
RC sentences like
(1) John drove his car through and
completely demolished a plate glass window
but only after trying and failing an indefinite
number of times, due to its highly non-
deterministic nature.
(Church 79) claims &amp;quot;some impressive initial
progress&amp;quot; processing conjunctions with his NL
parser YAP. Using a Marcus-type attention shift
mechanism, YAP can parse many conjunction
constructions including some cases of Gapping.
It doesn&apos;t offer a complete solution to
conjunction processing though: the Gapping
sentences YAP deals with are only those with two
NP remnants in a Gapped conjunct.

(McCord 80) proposes a &amp;quot;more straightforward
and more controllable&amp;quot; way of parsing sentences
like (1) within a Slot Grammar framework. He
treats &amp;quot;drove his car through and completely
demolished&amp;quot; as a conjoined VP, which doesn&apos;t seem
quite valid.
(Boguraev 83) suggests that when &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; is
encountered, a new ATN arc be dynamically
constructed which seeks to recognise a right hand
constituent categorially similar to the left hand
one just completed or being currently processed.
The problem is that the left-hand conjunct may not
be the current or most recent constituent but the
constituent of which that former one is a part.
(Berwick 83) parses successfully Gapped
sentences like
(2) Max gave Sally a nickel yesterday, and a
dime today
using an extended Marcus-type deterministic
parser. It is not clear, though, how his parser
would treat RC sentences like (1) where the first
conjunct is not a complete clause.
The present work attacks the coordinate
construction problem along the lines of DCG. Its
coverage is wider than the existing systems: both
Gapping, RNR and RC, as well as ordinary cases of
coordinate sentences, are taken into
consideration. The work is a major development of
(Huang 83)&apos;s CASSEX package, which in turn was
based on (Boguraev 79)&apos;s work, a system for
resolving linguistic ambiguities which combined
ATN grammars (Woods 73) and Preference Semantics
(Wilks 75).
In the first section of the paper, problems
raised for Natural Language Processing by Gapping,
RNR and RC are investigated. Section 2 gives a
grouping of sentences containing coordinate
conjunctions. Finally, the algorithm is described
in Section 3.

I GAPPING, RIGHT NODE RAISING AND
REDUCED CONJUNCTION
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.97843">
1.1 Gapping
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.828718">
Gapping is the case where the verb or the
verb together with some other elements in the
non-leftmost conjuncts is deleted from a sentence:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.798147">
(3) Bob saw Bill and Sue [saw] Mary.
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.994884">

<bodyText confidence="0.92319352173913">
(4) Max wants to try to begin to write a
novel, and Alex [wants to try to begin to write] a
play.
Gapping, we will observe the difference between
(12) and (13) on one hand, and (14) on the other:
Linguists have described rules for generating
Gapping, though none of them has made any effort
to formulate a rule for detecting Gapping. (Ross
67b) is the first who suggested a rule for
Gapping. The formalisation of the rule is due to
(Hankamer 73):
Gapping
NPXAZandNPXBZ--&gt;NPXAZandNPB
where A and B are nonidentical major
constituents*.
(Sag 76) pointed out that there were cases
where the left peripheral in the right conjunct
might be a non-NP, as in
(5) At our house, we play poker, and at
Betsy&apos;s house, bridge.
It should be noted that the two NPs in the
Gapping rule must not be the same, otherwise (7)
would be derived from (6):
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.964648">
(6) Bob saw Bill and Bob saw Mary.
(7) Bob saw Bill and Bob Mary.
whereas people actually say
(8) Bob saw Bill and Mary.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.994176555555556">
When processing (8), we treat it as a simplex
containing a compound object (&amp;quot;Bill and Mary&amp;quot;)
functioning as a unit (&amp;quot;unit interpretation&amp;quot;),
although as a rule we treat sentence containing
conjunction as derived from a &amp;quot;complex&amp;quot;, a
sentence consisting of more than one clause, in
this case &amp;quot;Bob saw Bill and Bob saw Mary&amp;quot;
(&amp;quot;sentence coordination interpretation&amp;quot;). The
reason for analysing (8) as a simplex is first,
for the purpose of translation, unit
interpretation is adequate (the ambiguity, if any,
will be &amp;quot;transferred&amp;quot; to the target language);
secondly, it is easier to process.
Another fact worth noticing is that in the
above Gapping rule, B in the second conjunct could
be anything, but not empty. E.g., the (a)s in the
following sentences are Gapping examples, but the
(b)s are not:
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.945406">
* According to the dependency grammar we adopt, we
define a major constituent of a given sentence S
as a constituent immediately dominated by the main
verb of S.

(13) I knew the man with the telescope

(14) Bob met Sue in Paris and Mary in London.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.967196615384615">
As we stated above, (12) is not a case of Gapping;
instead, we take &amp;quot;Sue and Mary&amp;quot; as a coordinate
NP. Nor is (13) a case of Gapping. (14), however,
cannot be treated as phrasal coordination because
the PP in the left conjunct (&amp;quot;in Paris&amp;quot;) is
directly dominated by the main verb so that &amp;quot;Mary&amp;quot;
is prevented from being conjoined to &amp;quot;Sue&amp;quot;.
Now, the Gapping Detecting Rule:
The structure &apos;NPI V A X and NP2 B&apos; where the
left conjunct is a complete clause, A and B are
major constituents, and X is either NIL or
a constituent not dominated by A, is a case of
Gapping if (OR (AND (X = NIL) (B = NP))
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.940821666666667">

(OR (B = NP) (B = to NP)))
(AND (X 1= NP) (X 1= NIL)))**
</equation>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.689005">
1.2 Right Node Raising (RNR)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.615492">
RNR is the case where the object in the non-
rightmost conjunct is missing.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.953249">
(15) John struck and kicked the boy.
(16) Bob looked at and Bill took the jar.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.614849875">
RNR raises less serious problems than Gapping
does. All we need to do is to parse the right
conjunct first, then copy the object over to the
left conjunct so that a representation for the
left clause can be constructed. Then we combine
the two to get a representation for the sentence.
Sentences like the following may raise
difficulty for parsing:
</bodyText>

treat &amp;quot;ate&amp;quot; as transitive or intransitive.

1.3 Reduced Conjunction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.816594363636364">
Reduced Conjunction is the case where the
conjoined surface strings are not well-formed
constituents as in

through&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;completely demolished&amp;quot; are not well-

serious as might have seemed, given our
understanding of Gapping and RNR. After we
process the left conjunct, we know that an
object is still needed (assuming that &amp;quot;through&amp;quot; is
a preposition). Then we parse the right
conjunct, copying over the subject from the left;
finally, we copy the object from the right
conjunct to the left to complete the left clause.

II GROUPING OF SENTENCES CONTAINING CONJUNCTIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998158111111111">
We can sort sentences containing conjunctions
into three major groups on the basis of the nature
of the left-most conjunct: Group A contains
sentences whose left-most conjuncts are recognized
by the analyser as complete clauses; Group B, the
left-most conjuncts are not complete clauses, but
contain verbs; and Group C, all the other cases.
The following is a detailed grouping with example
sentences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.955757875">
Al. (Gapping) Clause-internal ellipsis:
(19) I played football and John tennis.
(20) Bob met Sue in Paris and John Mary in
London.
(21) Max spoke fluently and Albert
haltingly.
A2. (Gapping) Left-peripheral ellipsis with two
NP remnants:
(22) Max gave a nickel to Sally and a dime
to Harvey.
(23) Max gave Sally a nickel and Harvey a
dime.
(24) Jack calls Joe Mike and Sam Harry.
A3. (Gapping) Left-peripheral ellipsis with one NP
remnant and some non-NP remnant(s):
(25) Bob met Sue in Paris and Mary in
London.
(26) John played football yesterday and
tennis today.

A5. The right conjunct is a complete clause:
(30) I played football and John watched the
television.
A6. The right conjunct is a verb phrase to be
treated as a clause with the subject deleted:
(31) The man kicked the child and threw the
ball.
A7. Sentences where the &amp;quot;unit interpretation&amp;quot;
should be taken:

III THE ALGORITHM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984790666666667">
The following algorithm, implemented in
PROLOG Version 3.3 (shown here in much abridged
form), produces correct syntactico-semantic
representations for all the sentences given in
Section 2. We show here some of the essential
clauses* of the algorithm: &apos;sentence&apos;,
&apos;rest sentencer and &apos;sentence_ conjunction&apos;. The
top-Most clause &apos;sentence&apos; parses sentences
consisting of one or more conjuncts. In the body
of &apos;sentence&apos;, we have as sub-goals the
disjunction of &apos;noun_phrase&apos; and &apos;noun_phraser,
for getting the sentence subject; the disjunction
of &apos;[W], is_verb&apos; and &apos;verbl&apos;, plus &apos;rest_verb&apos;,
for treating the verb of the sentence; the
disjunction of &apos;rest_sentence&apos; and &apos;rest_
sentencel&apos; for handling the object, prepositional
phrases, etc; and finally &apos;sentence_conjunction&apos;,
for handling coordinate conjunctions.
The Gapping, RNR and RC sentences in Section
II contain deletions from either left or right
conjuncts or both. Deleted subjects in right
conjuncts are handled by &apos;noun_phraser in our
program; deleted verbs in right conjuncts by
&apos;verbl% The most difficult deletions to handle
(for previous systems) are those from the left
conjuncts, ie. the deleted objects of RNR (Group
Bl) and the deleted preposition objects of RC
(Group B2), because when the left conjuncts are
being parsed, the deleted parts are not available.
This is dealt with neatly in PROLOG DCG by using
logical variables which stand for the deleted
parts, are &amp;quot;holes&amp;quot; in the structures built, and
get filled later by unification as the parsing
proceeds.

For sentence (36) (&amp;quot;John drove his car
through and completely demolished a plate glass
window&amp;quot;), for instance, when parsing the left
conjunct, &apos;rest_sentencel&apos; will be called event-
ually. The following verb structure will be built:
v(drovel,agent(np(pronoun(John))), object(np(det
(his), pre_mod([1), n(carl), post_mods(I1))), post
verb mods(prep_mods(prep(through), prep_obj(Prep_
Obj)), where the logical variable Prep Obj will be
unified later with the argument standing for the
object in the right conjunct (ie, &amp;quot;a plate glass
window&amp;quot;). When &apos;sentence&apos; is called via the sub-
goal &apos;sentence_conjunction&apos; to process the right
conjunct, the deleted subject &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; will be
copied over via &apos;noun_phrasel&apos;. Finally a
structure is built which is a combination of two
complete clauses. During the processing little
effort is wasted. The backward deleted consti-
tuents (&amp;quot;a plate glass window&amp;quot; here) are recovered
by using logical variables; the forward deleted
ones (&amp;quot;John&amp;quot; here) by passing over values (via
unification) from the conjunct already processed.
Moreover, the &apos;try-and-fail&apos; procedure is carried
out in a controlled and intelligent way. Thus a
high efficiency lacking in many other systems is
achieved (space prevents us from providing a
detailed discussion of this issue here).
