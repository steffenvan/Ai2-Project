Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9998421">
Within the SemEval-2013 evaluation exercise, the
TempEval-3 shared task aims to advance research
on temporal information processing. It follows on
from TempEval-1 and -2, with: a three-part struc-
ture covering temporal expression, event, and tem-
poral relation extraction; a larger dataset; and new
single measures to rank systems – in each task and in
general. In this paper, we describe the participants’
approaches, results, and the observations from the
results, which may guide future research in this area.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999403043478261">
The TempEval task (Verhagen et al., 2009) was added as a
new task in SemEval-2007. The ultimate aim of research
in this area is the automatic identification of temporal ex-
pressions (timexes), events, and temporal relations within
a text as specified in TimeML annotation (Pustejovsky et
al., 2005). However, since addressing this aim in a first
evaluation challenge was deemed too difficult a staged
approach was suggested.
TempEval (henceforth TempEval-1) was an initial
evaluation exercise focusing only on the categorization of
temporal relations and only in English. It included three
relation types: event-timex, event-dct,1 and relations be-
tween main events in consecutive sentences.
TempEval-2 (Verhagen et al., 2010) extended
TempEval-1, growing into a multilingual task, and con-
sisting of six subtasks rather than three. This included
event and timex extraction, as well as the three relation
tasks from TempEval-1, with the addition of a relation
task where one event subordinates another.
TempEval-3 (UzZaman et al., 2012b) is a follow-up
to TempEval 1 and 2, covering English and Spanish.
TempEval-3 is different from its predecessors in a few
respects:

<bodyText confidence="0.999930535714286">
Size of the corpus: the dataset used has about 600K
word silver standard data and about 100K word gold stan-
dard data for training, compared to around 50K word cor-
pus used in TempEval 1 and 2. Temporal annotation is
a time-consuming task for humans, which has limited
the size of annotated data in previous TempEval exer-
cises. Current systems, however, are performing close to
the inter-annotator reliability, which suggests that larger
corpora could be built from automatically annotated data
with minor human reviews. We want to explore whether
there is value in adding a large automatically created sil-
ver standard to a hand-crafted gold standard.
End-to-end temporal relation processing task: the
temporal relation classification tasks are performed from
raw text, i.e. participants need to extract their own events
and temporal expressions first, determine which ones to
link and then obtain the relation types. In previous Tem-
pEvals, gold timexes, events, and relations (without cate-
gory) were given to participants.
Temporal relation types: the full set of temporal re-
lations in TimeML are used, rather than the reduced set
used in earlier TempEvals.
Platinum test set: A new test dataset has been devel-
oped for this edition. It is based on manual annotations
by experts over new text (unseen in previous editions).
Evaluation: we report a temporal awareness score for
evaluating temporal relations, which helps to rank sys-
tems with a single score.

1 and TempEval-2 had the same documents as TimeBank
but different relation types and events.
For both TimeBank and AQUAINT, we, (i) cleaned up
the formatting for all files making it easy to review and
read, (ii) made all files XML and TimeML schema com-
patible, (iii) added some missing events and temporal ex-
pressions. In TimeBank, we, (i) borrowed the events from
the TempEval-2 corpus and (ii) borrowed the temporal re-
lations from TimeBank corpus, which contains a full set
of temporal relations. In AQUAINT, we added the tem-
poral relations between event and DCT (document cre-
ation time), which was missing for many documents in
that corpus. These existing corpora comprised the high-
quality component of our training set.

2.2 New Corpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99979345">
We created two new datasets: a small, manually-
annotated set over new text (platinum); and a machine-
annotated, automatically-merged dataset based on out-
puts of multiple systems (silver).
The TempEval-3 platinum evaluation corpus was anno-
tated/reviewed by the organizers, who are experts in the
area. This process used the TimeML Annotation Guide-
lines v1.2.1 (Sauriet al., 2006). Every file was anno-
tated independently by at least two expert annotators, and
a third was dedicated to adjudicating between annotations
and merging the final result. Some annotators based their
work on TIPSem annotation suggestions (Llorens et al.,
2012b). The GATE Annotation Diff tool was used for
merging (Cunningham et al., 2013), a custom TimeML
validator ensured integrity,3 and CAVaT (Derczynski and
Gaizauskas, 2010) was used to determine various modes
of TimeML mis-annotation and inconsistency that are in-
expressable via XML schema. Post-exercise, that corpus
(TempEval-3 Platinum with around 6K tokens, on com-
pletely new text) is released for the community to review

and improve.4 Inter-annotator agreement (measured with
F1, as per Hripcsak and Rothschild (2005)) and the num-
ber of annotation passes per document were higher than
in existing TimeML corpora, hence the name. Details are
given in Table 1. Attribute value scores are given based
on the agreed entity set. These are for exact matches.
The TempEval-3 silver evaluation corpus is a 600K
word corpus collected from Gigaword (Parker et
al., 2011). We automatically annotated this corpus
by TIPSem, TIPSem-B (Llorens et al., 2013) and
TRIOS (UzZaman and Allen, 2010). These systems were
retrained on the corrected TimeBank and AQUAINT cor-
pus to generate the original TimeML temporal relation
set. We then merged these three state-of-the-art sys-
tem outputs using our merging algorithm (Llorens et al.,
2012a). In our selected merged configuration all entities
and relations suggested by the best system (TIPSem) are
added in the merged output. Suggestions from other sys-
tems (TRIOS and TIPSem-B) are added in the merged
output, only if they are also supported by another system.
The weights considered in our configuration are: TIPSem
0.36, TIPSemB 0.32, TRIOS 0.32.
For Spanish, Spanish TimeBank 1.0 corpus (Sauriand
Badia, 2012) wads used. It is the same corpus that was
used in TempEval-2, with a major review of entity anno-
tation and an important improvement regarding temporal
relation annotation. For TempEval-3, we converted ES-
TimeBank link types to the TimeML standard types based
on Allen’s temporal relations (Allen, 1983).
Table 2 summarizes our released corpora, measured
with PTB-scheme tokens as words. All data produced
was annotated using a well-defined subset of TimeML,
designed for easy processing, and for reduced ambigu-
ity compared to standard TimeML. Participants were en-
couraged to validate their submissions using a purpose-
built tool to ensure that submitted runs were legible. We
called this standard TimeML-strict, and release it sepa-
rately (Derczynski et al., 2013).

<bodyText confidence="0.99510872">
This is the ultimate task for evaluating an end-to-end sys-
tem that goes from raw text to TimeML annotation of
entities and links. It entails performing tasks A and B.
From raw text extract the temporal entities (events and
timexes), identify the pairs of temporal entities that have
a temporal link (TLINK) and classify the temporal re-
lation between them. Possible pair of entities that can
have a temporal link are: (i) main events of consecu-
tive sentences, (ii) pairs of events in the same sentence,
(iii) event and timex in the same sentence and (iv) event
and document creation time. In TempEval-3, TimeML
relation are used, i.e.: BEFORE, AFTER, INCLUDES, IS-
INCLUDED, DURING, SIMULTANEOUS, IMMEDIATELY
AFTER, IMMEDIATELY BEFORE, IDENTITY, BEGINS,
ENDS, BEGUN-BY and ENDED-BY.
In addition to this main tasks, we also include two extra
temporal relation tasks:
Task C (Annotating relations given gold entities)
Given the gold entities, identify the pairs of entities that
have a temporal link (TLINK) and classify the temporal
relations between them.
Task C relation only (Annotating relations given gold
entities and related pairs) Given the temporal entities
and the pair of entities that have a temporal link, classify
the temporal relation between them.

4.1 Temporal Entity Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999624777777778">
To evaluate temporal entities (events and temporal ex-
pressions), we need to evaluate, (i) How many entities are
correctly identified, (ii) If the extents for the entities are
correctly identified, and (iii) How many entity attributes
are correctly identified. We use classical precision and
recall for recognition.
How many entities are correctly identified: We evalu-
ate our entities using the entity-based evaluation with the
equations below.

Precision = |SysentitynRefentity|
|Sysentity|
Recall = |SysentitynRefentity|

<bodyText confidence="0.981627388888889">
where, Sysentity contains the entities extracted by the
system that we want to evaluate, and Refentity contains
the entities from the reference annotation that are being
compared.
If the extents for the entities are correctly identified:
We compare our entities with both strict match and re-
laxed match. When there is a exact match between the
system entity and gold entity then we call it strict match,
e.g. “sunday morning” vs “sunday morning”. When there
is a overlap between the system entity and gold entity
then we call it relaxed match, e.g. “sunday” vs “sunday
morning”. When there is a relaxed match, we compare
the attribute values.
How many entity attributes are correctly identified: We
evaluate our entity attributes using the attribute F1-score,
which captures how well the system identified both the
entity and attribute (attr) together.
Attribute Recall =

4.2 Temporal Relation Processing
</subsectionHeader>

To evaluate relations, we use the evaluation metric pre-
sented by UzZaman and Allen (2011).5 This metric cap-
tures the temporal awareness of an annotation in terms
of precision, recall and F1 score. Temporal awareness
is defined as the performance of an annotation as identi-
fying and categorizing temporal relations, which implies
the correct recognition and classification of the tempo-
ral entities involved in the relations. Unlike TempEval-
2 relation score, where only categorization is evaluated
for relations, this metric evaluates how well pairs of enti-
ties are identified, how well the relations are categorized,
and how well the events and temporal expressions are ex-
tracted.

The aim of this evaluation is to provide a meaningful re-
port of the performance obtained by the participants in
the tasks defined in Section 3.
Furthermore, the results include TIPSem as reference
for comparison. This was used as a pre-annotation system
in some cases. TIPSem obtained the best results in event
processing task in TempEval-2 and offered very compet-
itive results in timex and relation processing. The best
timex processing system in TempEval-2 (HeidelTime) is
participating in this edition as well, therefore we included
TIPSem as a reference in all tasks.
We only report results in main measures. Results are

5.1 Results for English
5.1.1 Task A: Timexes
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992704065217391">
We had nine participants and 21 unique runs for tem-
poral expression extraction task, Task A. Table 3 shows
the results. Details about participants’ approaches can be
found in Table 4.
We rank the participants for Task A on the F1 score
of most important timex attribute – Value. To get the
attribute Value correct, a system needs to correctly nor-
malise the temporal expression. This score (Value F1)
captures the performance of extracting the timex and
identifying the attribute Value together (Value F1 = Timex
F1 *Value Accuracy).
Participants approached the temporal expression ex-
traction task with rule-engineered methods, machine
learning methods and also hybrid methods. For temporal
expression normalization (identifying the timex attribute
value), all participants used rule-engineered approaches.
Observations: We collected the following observa-
tions from the results and from participants’ experiments.
Strategy: Competition was close for timex recogni-
tion and the best systems all performed within 1% of
each other. On our newswire corpus, statistical systems
(ClearTK) performed best at strict matching, and rule-
engineered system best at relaxed matching (NavyTime,
SUTime, HeidelTime).
Strategy: post-processing, on top of machine learning-
base temporal expression extraction, provided a statisti-
cally significant improvement in both precision and recall
(ManTIME).
Data: using the large silver dataset, alone or together
with human annotated data, did not give improvements in
performance for Task A. Human-annotated gold standard
data alone provided the best performance (ManTIME).
Data: TimeBank alone was better than TimeBank and
AQUAINT together for Task A (ClearTK).
Features: syntactic and gazetteers did not provide any
statistically significant increment of performance with re-
spect to the morphological features alone (ManTIME).
Regarding the two sub-tasks of timex annotation,
recognition and interpretation/normalisation, we noticed
a shift in the state of the art. While normalisation is
currently (and perhaps inherently) done best by rule-
engineered systems, recognition is now done well by a
variety of methods. Where formerly, rule-engineered
timex recognition always outperformed other classes of
approach, now it is clear that rule-engineering and ma-
chine learning are equally good at timex recognition.

(top three participants in the task – ATT, KUL, KUL-
TE3RunABC). Additionally, TimeBank and AQUAINT
together performed better than just TimeBank alone
(NavyTime-1, ClearTK-3,4).
Linguistic Features: Semantic features (ls and ss) have
played an important role, since the best systems (TIPSem,
ATT1 and KUL) include them. However, these three are
not the only systems using semantic features.

For complete temporal annotation from raw text (Task
ABC - Task C from raw text) and for temporal relation
only tasks (Task C, Task C relation only), we had five
participants in total.
For relation evaluation, we primarily evaluate on Task
ABC (Task C from raw text), which requires joint entity
extraction, link identification and relation classification.
The results for this task can be found in Table 7.
While TIPSem obtained the best results in task ABC,
especially in recall, it was used by some annotators to
pre-label data. In the interest of rigour and fairness, we
separate out this system.
For task C, for provided participants with entities and
participants identified: between which entity pairs a rela-
tion exists (link identification); and the class of that rela-
tion. Results are given in Table 8. We also evaluate the
participants on the relation by providing the entities and
the links (performance in Table 9) – TIPSem could not be
evaluated in this setting since the system is not prepared
to do categorization only unless the relations are divided
as in TempEval-2. For these Task C related tasks, we had
only one new participant, who didn’t participate in Task
A and B: UTTime.
Identifying which pair of entities to consider for tem-
poral relations is a new task in this TempEval challenge.
The participants approached the problems in data-driven,
rule-based and also in hybrid ways (Table 1010). On

the other hand, all the participants used data-driven ap-
proaches for temporal relations (Table 11).
Observations: We collected the following observa-
tions from the results and from participants’ experiments.
Strategy: For relation classification, all participants
used partially or fully machine learning-based systems.
Data: None of the participants implemented their sys-
tems training on the silver data. Most of the systems use
the combined TimeBank and AQUAINT (TBAQ) corpus.
Data: Adding additional high-quality relations, either
Philippe Muller’s closure-based inferences or the verb
clause relations from Bethard et al. (2007), typically in-
creased recall and the overall performance (ClearTK runs
two and four).
Features: Participants mostly used the morphosyntac-
tic and lexical semantic information. The best perform-
ing systems from TempEval-2 (TIPSem and TRIOS) ad-
ditionally used sentence level semantic information. One
participant in TempEval-3 (UTTime) also did deep pars-
ing for the sentence level semantic features.
Features: Using more Linguistic knowledge is impor-
tant for the task, but it is more important to execute it
properly. Many systems performed better using less lin-
guistic knowledge. Hence a system (e.g. ClearTK) with
basic morphosyntactic features is hard to beat with more
semantic features, if not used properly.

case, TIPSemB-Freeling is provided as a state-of-the-art
reference covering all the tasks. TIPSemB-Freeling is the
Spanish version of TIPSem with the main difference that
it does not include semantic roles. Furthermore, it uses
Freeling (Padr´o and Stanilovsky, 2012) to obtain the lin-
guistic features automatically.
Table 12 shows the results obtained for task A. As it
can be observed HeidelTime obtains the best results. It
improves the previous state-of-the-art results (TIPSemB-
F), especially in normalization (value F1).
Table 13 shows the results from event extraction. In
this case, the previous state-of-the-art is not improved.
Table 14 only shows the results obtained in temporal
awareness by the state-of-the-art system since there were
not participants on this task. We observe that TIPSemB-F
approach offers competitive results, which is comparable
to results obtained in TE3 English test set.

TempEval-2 Spanish test set is included as a subset of this
TempEval-3 test set. We can therefore compare the per-
formance across editions. Furthermore, we can include
the full-featured TIPSem (Llorens et al., 2010), which
unlike TIPSemB-F used the AnCora (Taul´e et al., 2008)
corpus annotations as features including semantic roles.
For timexes, as can be seen in Table 15, the origi-
nal TIPSem obtains better results for timex extraction,
which favours the hypothesis that machine learning sys-
tems are very well suited for this task (if the training data
is sufficiently representative). However, for normaliza-
tion (value F1), HeidelTime – a rule-engineered system –
obtains better results. This indicates that rule-based ap-

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963166666667">
In this paper, we described the TempEval-3 task within
the SemEval 2013 exercise. This task involves identify-
ing temporal expressions (timexes), events and their tem-
poral relations in text. In particular participating systems
were required to automatically annotate raw text using
TimeML annotation scheme
This is the first time end-to-end systems are evalu-
ated with a new single score (temporal awareness). In
TempEval-3 participants had to obtain temporal relations
from their own extracted timexes and events which is a
very challenging task and was the ultimate evaluation aim
of TempEval. It was proposed at TempEval-1 but has not
been carried out until this edition.
The newly-introduced silver data proved not so useful
for timex extraction or relation classification, but did help
with event extraction. The new single-measure helped to
rank systems easily.
Future work could investigate temporal annotation in
specific applications. Current annotations metrics evalu-
ate relations for entities in the same consecutive sentence.
For document-level understanding we need to understand
discourse and pragmatic information. Temporal question
answering-based evaluation (UzZaman et al., 2012a) can
help us to evaluate participants on document level tempo-
ral information understanding without creating any addi-
tional training data. Also, summarisation, machine trans-
lation, and information retrieval need temporal annota-
tion. Application-oriented challenges could further re-
search in these areas.
From a TimeML point of view, we still haven’t tack-
led subordinate relations (TimeML SLINKs), aspectual
relations (TimeML ALINKs), or temporal signal anno-
tation (Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2011). The critical
questions of which links to annotate, and whether the cur-
rent set of temporal relation types are appropriate for lin-
guistic annotation, are still unanswered.

Observations: We collected the following observations from the results and from participants’ experiments. Strategy: For relation classification, all participants used partially or fully machine learning-based systems. Data: None of the participants implemented their systems training on the silver data. Most of the systems use the combined TimeBank and AQUAINT (TBAQ) corpus. Data: Adding additional high-quality relations, either Philippe Muller’s closure-based inferences or the verb clause relations from Bethard et al. (2007), typically increased recall and the overall performance (ClearTK runs two and four). Features: Participants mostly used the morphosyntactic and lexical semantic information. The best performing systems from TempEval-2 (TIPSem and TRIOS) additionally used sentence level semantic information. One participant in TempEval-3 (UTTime) also did deep parsing for the sentence level semantic features. Features: Using more Linguistic knowledge is important for the task, but it is more important to execute it properly. Many systems performed better using less linguistic knowledge.

For TempEval-3, we converted ESTimeBank link types to the TimeML standard types based on Allen’s temporal relations (Allen, 1983). Table 2 summarizes our released corpora, measured with PTB-scheme tokens as words. All data produced was annotated using a well-defined subset of TimeML, designed for easy processing, and for reduced ambiguity compared to standard TimeML. Participants were encouraged to validate their submissions using a purposebuilt tool to ensure that submitted runs were legible. We called this standard TimeML-strict, and release it separately (Derczynski et al., 2013). 3 Tasks The three main tasks proposed for TempEval-3 focus on TimeML entities and relations: 3.1 Task A (Timex extraction and normalization) Determine the extent of the timexes in a text as defined by the TimeML TIMEX3 tag. In addition, determine the value of the features TYPE and VALUE. The possible values of TYPE are time, date, duration, and set; VALUE is a normalized value as defined by the TIMEX3 standard. 4In the ACL data and code repository, reference ADCR2013T001.

In this case, the previous state-of-the-art is not improved. Table 14 only shows the results obtained in temporal awareness by the state-of-the-art system since there were not participants on this task. We observe that TIPSemB-F approach offers competitive results, which is comparable to results obtained in TE3 English test set. 6.1 Comparison with TempEval-2 TempEval-2 Spanish test set is included as a subset of this TempEval-3 test set. We can therefore compare the performance across editions. Furthermore, we can include the full-featured TIPSem (Llorens et al., 2010), which unlike TIPSemB-F used the AnCora (Taul´e et al., 2008) corpus annotations as features including semantic roles. For timexes, as can be seen in Table 15, the original TIPSem obtains better results for timex extraction, which favours the hypothesis that machine learning systems are very well suited for this task (if the training data is sufficiently representative). However, for normalization (value F1), HeidelTime – a rule-engineered system – obtains better results. This indicates that rule-based approaches have the upper hand in this task.

Details are given in Table 1. Attribute value scores are given based on the agreed entity set. These are for exact matches. The TempEval-3 silver evaluation corpus is a 600K word corpus collected from Gigaword (Parker et al., 2011). We automatically annotated this corpus by TIPSem, TIPSem-B (Llorens et al., 2013) and TRIOS (UzZaman and Allen, 2010). These systems were retrained on the corrected TimeBank and AQUAINT corpus to generate the original TimeML temporal relation set. We then merged these three state-of-the-art system outputs using our merging algorithm (Llorens et al., 2012a). In our selected merged configuration all entities and relations suggested by the best system (TIPSem) are added in the merged output. Suggestions from other systems (TRIOS and TIPSem-B) are added in the merged output, only if they are also supported by another system. The weights considered in our configuration are: TIPSem 0.36, TIPSemB 0.32, TRIOS 0.32. </context>

Temporal awareness is defined as the performance of an annotation as identifying and categorizing temporal relations, which implies the correct recognition and classification of the temporal entities involved in the relations. Unlike TempEval2 relation score, where only categorization is evaluated for relations, this metric evaluates how well pairs of entities are identified, how well the relations are categorized, and how well the events and temporal expressions are extracted.

It follows on from TempEval-1 and -2, with: a three-part structure covering temporal expression, event, and temporal relation extraction; a larger dataset; and new single measures to rank systems – in each task and in general. In this paper, we describe the participants’ approaches, results, and the observations from the results, which may guide future research in this area. 1 Introduction The TempEval task (Verhagen et al., 2009) was added as a new task in SemEval-2007. The ultimate aim of research in this area is the automatic identification of temporal expressions (timexes), events, and temporal relations within a text as specified in TimeML annotation (Pustejovsky et al., 2005). However, since addressing this aim in a first evaluation challenge was deemed too difficult a staged approach was suggested. TempEval (henceforth TempEval-1) was an initial evaluation exercise focusing only on the categorization of temporal relations and only in English. It included three relation types: event-timex, event-dct,1 and relatio</context>
