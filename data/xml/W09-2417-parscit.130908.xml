<bodyText confidence="0.999043466666667">
In this paper, we describe the SemEval-2010
shared task on “Linking Events and Their Par-
ticipants in Discourse”. This task is a variant
of the classical semantic role labelling task.
The novel aspect is that we focus on linking
local semantic argument structures across sen-
tence boundaries. Specifically, the task aims at
linking locally uninstantiated roles to their co-
referents in the wider discourse context (if such
co-referents exist). This task is potentially ben-
eficial for a number of NLP applications and
we hope that it will not only attract researchers
from the semantic role labelling community
but also from co-reference resolution and infor-
mation extraction.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999488941176471">
Semantic role labelling (SRL) has been defined as
a sentence-level natural-language processing task in
which semantic roles are assigned to the syntactic
arguments of a predicate (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
Semantic roles describe the function of the partici-
pants in an event. Identifying the semantic roles of
the predicates in a text allows knowing who did what
to whom when where how, etc.
SRL has attracted much attention in recent years,
as witnessed by several shared tasks in Sense-
val/SemEval (M`arquez et al., 2007; Litkowski, 2004;
Baker et al., 2007; Diab et al., 2007), and CoNLL
(Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez,
2005; Surdeanu et al., 2008). The state-of-the-art
in semantic role labelling has now advanced so
much that a number of studies have shown that au-
tomatically inferred semantic argument structures

can lead to tangible performance gains in NLP ap-
plications such as information extraction (Surdeanu
et al., 2003), question answering (Shen and Lapata,
2007) or recognising textual entailment (Burchardt
and Frank, 2006).
However, semantic role labelling as it is currently
defined also misses a lot of information that would
be beneficial for NLP applications that deal with
text understanding (in the broadest sense), such as
information extraction, summarisation, or question
answering. The reason for this is that SRL has tra-
ditionally been viewed as a sentence-internal task.
Hence, relations between different local semantic ar-
gument structures are disregarded and this leads to a
loss of important semantic information.
This view of SRL as a sentence-internal task is
partly due to the fact that large-scale manual anno-
tation projects such as FrameNet1 and PropBank2
typically present their annotations lexicographically
by lemma rather than by source text. Furthermore,
in the case of FrameNet, the annotation effort did
not start out with the goal of exhaustive corpus an-
notation but instead focused on isolated instances of
the target words sampled from a very large corpus,
which did not allow for a view of the data as ‘full-text
annotation’.
It is clear that there is an interplay between local
argument structure and the surrounding discourse
(Fillmore, 1977). In early work, Palmer et al. (1986)
discussed filling null complements from context by
using knowledge about individual predicates and ten-

dencies of referential chaining across sentences. But
so far there have been few attempts to find links
between argument structures across clause and sen-
tence boundaries explicitly on the basis of semantic
relations between the predicates involved. Two no-
table exceptions are Fillmore and Baker (2001) and
Burchardt et al. (2005). Fillmore and Baker (2001)
analyse a short newspaper article and discuss how
frame semantics could benefit discourse processing
but without making concrete suggestions of how to
model this. Burchardt et al. (2005) provide a detailed
analysis of the links between the local semantic argu-
ment structures in a short text; however their system
is not fully implemented either.
In the shared task, we intend to make a first step
towards taking SRL beyond the domain of individual
sentences by linking local semantic argument struc-
tures to the wider discourse context. In particular, we
address the problem of finding fillers for roles which
are neither instantiated as direct dependents of our
target predicates nor displaced through long-distance
dependency or coinstantatiation constructions. Of-
ten a referent for an uninstantiated role can be found
in the wider context, i.e. in preceding or following
sentences. An example is given in (1), where the
CHARGES role (ARG2 in PropBank) of cleared is left
empty but can be linked to murder in the previous
sentence.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.987413">
(1) In a lengthy court case the defendant was
tried for murder. In the end, he was cleared.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996463888888889">
Another very rich example is provided by (2),
where, for instance, the experiencer and the object of
jealousy are not overtly expressed as syntactic depen-
dents of the noun jealousy but can be inferred to be
Watson and the speaker, Holmes, respectively.
(2) Watson won’t allow that I know anything
of art but that is mere jealousy because our
views upon the subject differ.
NIs are also very frequent in clinical reports.
For example, in (3) the EXPERIENCER role of
“cough”, “tachypnea”, and “breathing” can be linked
to “twenty-two month old”. Text mining systems in
the biomedical domain focus on extracting relations
between biomedical entities and information about
patients. It is important that these systems extract
information as accurately as possible. Thus, finding
co-referents for NIs is also very relevant for improv-
ing results on mining relations in biomedical texts.

In the following sections we describe the task in
more detail. We start by providing some background
on null instantiations (Section 2). Section 3 gives an
overview of the task, followed by a description of
how we intend to create the data (Section 4). Sec-
tion 5 provides a short description of how null in-
stantiations could be resolved automatically given
the provided data. Finally, Section 6 discusses the
evaluation measures and we wrap up in Section 7.

2 Background on Null Instantiation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999239545454545">
The theory of null complementation used here is the
one adopted by FrameNet, which derives from the
work of Fillmore (1986).3 Briefly, omissions of core
arguments of predicates are categorised along two
dimensions, the licensor and the interpretation they
receive. The idea of a licensor refers to the fact that
either a particular lexical item or a particular gram-
matical construction must be present for the omission
of a frame element (FE) to occur. For instance, the
omission of the agent in (4) is licensed by the passive
construction.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.762681">
(4) No doubt, mistakes were made 0Protagonist.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.966834333333333">
The omission is a constructional omission because
it can apply to any predicate with an appropriate
semantics that allows it to combine with the passive
construction. On the other hand, the omission in (5)
is lexically specific: the verb arrive allows the Goal
to be unspecified but the verb reach, also a member
of the Arriving frame, does not.
(5) We arrived 0Goal at 8pm.
The above two examples also illustrate the second
major dimension of variation. Whereas, in (4) the
protagonist making the mistake is only existentially
bound within the discourse (instance of indefinite null

roles’ is very similar (see also Palmer (1990)).

instantiation, INI), the Goal location in (5) is an entity
that must be accessible to speaker and hearer from
the discourse or its context (definite null instantiation,
DNI). Finally note that the licensing construction or
lexical item fully and reliably determines the interpre-
tation. Missing by-phrases always have an indefinite
interpretation and whenever arrive omits the Goal
lexically, the Goal has to be interpreted as definite,
as it is in (5).
The import of this classification to the task here
is that we will concentrate on cases of DNI whether
they are licensed lexically or constructionally.

3 Task Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9501122">
We plan to run the task in the following two modes:
Full Task For the full task we supply a test set in
which the target words are marked and labelled with
the correct sense (i.e. frame).4 The participants then
have to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9984785">
1. find the overt semantic arguments of the target
(role recognition)
2. label them with the correct role (role labelling)
3. recognize definite null instantiations and find
links to antecedents in the wider context (NI
linking)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999837416666667">
NIs only In the second mode, participants will be
supplied with a test set which is annotated with gold
standard local semantic argument structure.5 The
task is then restricted to recognizing that a core role
is missing, ascertaining that it must have a definite
interpretation and finding a filler for it (i.e., sub-task
3 from the full task).
The full task and the null instantiation linking task
will be evaluated separately. By setting up a SRL
task, we expect to attract participants from the es-
tablished SRL community. Furthermore, by allow-
ing participants to only address the second task, we

<footnote confidence="0.978497555555556">
4We supply the correct sense to ensure that all systems use
the same role inventory for each target (i.e., the role inventory
associated with the gold standard sense). This makes it easier
to evaluate the systems consistently with respect to role assign-
ments and null instantiation linking, which is our main focus.
5The training set is identical for both set-ups and will contain
the full annotation, i.e., frames, semantic roles and their fillers,
and referents of null instantiations in the wider context (see
Section 4 for details).

hope to also attract researchers from areas such as co-
reference resolution or information extraction who do
not want to implement a complete SRL system. We
also plan to provide the data with both FrameNet and
PropBank style annotations to encourage researchers
from both areas to take part.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.998891" genericHeader="method">
4 Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989972972973">
The data will come from one of Arthur Conan
Doyle’s fiction works. We chose fiction rather than
news because we believe that fiction texts with
a linear narrative generally contain more context-
resolvable null instantiations. They also tend to be
longer and have a simpler structure than news texts
which typically revisit the same facts repeatedly at
different levels of detail (in the so-called ‘inverted
pyramid’ structure) and which mix event reports with
commentary and evaluation, thus sequencing mate-
rial that is understood as running in parallel. Fiction
texts should lend themselves more readily to a first at-
tempt at integrating discourse structure into semantic
role labeling. We chose Conan Doyle’s work because
most of his books are not subject to copyright restric-
tions anymore, which allows us to freely release the
annotated data.
We plan to make the data sets available with both
FrameNet and PropBank semantic argument anno-
tation, so that participants can choose which frame-
work they want to work in. The annotations will
originally be made using FrameNet-style and will
later be mapped semi-automatically to PropBank an-
notations. The data set for the FrameNet version of
the task will be built at Saarland University, in close
co-operation with the FrameNet team in Berkeley.
We aim for the same density of annotation as is ex-
hibited by FrameNet’s existing full-text annotation6
and are currently investigating whether the semantic
argument annotation can be done semi-automatically,
e.g., by starting the annotation with a run of the Shal-
maneser role labeller (Erk and Pad´o, 2006), whose
output is then corrected and expanded manually. To
ensure a high annotation quality, at least part of the
data will be annotated by two annotators and then
manually adjudicated. We also provide detailed an-
notation guidelines (largely following the FrameNet

guidelines) and any open questions are discussed in
a weekly annotation meeting.
For the annotation of null instantiations and their
links to the surrounding discourse we have to create
new guidelines as this is a novel annotation task. We
will adopt ideas from the annotation of co-reference
information, linking locally unrealised roles to all
mentions of the referents in the surrounding dis-
course, where available. We will mark only identity
relations but not part-whole or bridging relations be-
tween referents. The set of unrealised roles under
consideration includes only the core arguments but
not adjuncts (peripheral or extra-thematic roles in
FrameNet’s terminology). Possible antecedents are
not restricted to noun phrases but include all con-
stituents that can be (local) role fillers for some pred-
icate plus complete sentences (which can sometimes
fill roles such as MESSAGE).
The data-set for PropBank will be created by map-
ping the FrameNet annotations onto PropBank and
NomBank labels. For verbal targets, we use the Sem-
link7 mappings. For nominal targets, there is no
existing hand-checked mapping between FrameNet
and NomBank but we will explore a way of build-
ing a FrameNet - NomBank mapping at least for
eventive nouns indirectly with the help of Semlink.
This would take advantage of the fact that PropBank
verbs and eventive NomBank nouns both have a map-
ping to VerbNet classes, which are referenced also by
Semlink. Time permitting, non-eventive nouns could
be mapped manually. For FrameNet targets of other
parts of speech, in particular adjectives and prepo-
sitions, no equivalent PropBank-style counterparts
will be available. The result of the automatic map-
pings will be partly hand-checked. The annotations
resolving null instantiations need no adjustment.
We intend to annotate at least two data sets of
around 4,000 words. One set for testing and one for
training. Because we realise that the training set will
not be large enough to train a semantic role labelling
system on it, we permit the participants to boost the
training data for the SRL task by making use of the
existing FrameNet and PropBank corpora.8

5 Resolving Null Instantiations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999080260869565">
We conceive of null instantiation resolution as a three
step problem. First, one needs to determine whether a
core role is missing. This involves looking up which
core roles are overtly expressed and which are not.
In the second step, one needs to determine what
licenses an omission and what its interpretation is.
To do this, one can use rules and heuristics based on
various syntactic and lexical facts of English. As an
example of a relevant syntactic fact, consider that sub-
jects in English can only be omitted when licensed by
a construction. One such construction is the impera-
tive (e.g. Please, sit down). Since this construction
also specifies that the missing referent must be the
addressee of the speaker of the imperative, it is clear
what referent one has to try to find.
As for using lexical knowledge, consider omis-
sions of the Goods FE of the verb steal in the Theft
frame. FrameNet annotation shows that whenever
the Goods FE of steal is missing it is interpreted in-
definitely, suggesting that a new instance of the FE
being missing should have the same interpretation.
More evidence to the same effect can be derived us-
ing Ruppenhofer’s (2004) observation that the inter-
pretation of a lexically licensed omission is definite
if the overt instances of the FE have mostly definite
form (i.e. have definite determiners such as that, the,
this), and indefinite if they are mostly indefinite (i.e.
have bare or indefinite determiners such as a(n) or
some). The morphology of overt instances of an FE
could be inspected in the FrameNet data, or if the
predicate has only one sense or a very dominant one,
then the frequencies could even be estimated from
unannotated corpora.
The third step is linking definite omissions to ref-
erents in the context. This linking problem could be
modelled as a co-reference resolution task. While
the work of Palmer et al. (1986) relied on special
lexicons, one might instead want to learn information
about the semantic content of different role fillers
and then assess for each of the potential referents in
the discourse context whether their semantic content
is close enough to the expected content of the null
instantiated role.
Information about the likely fillers of a role can
be obtained from annotated data sets (e.g., FrameNet
or PropBank). For instance, typical fillers of the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99821">
109
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999316">
CHARGES role of clear might be murder, accusa-
tions, allegations, fraud etc. The semantic content of
the role could then be represented in a vector space
model, using additional unannotated data to build
meaning vectors for the attested role fillers. Meaning
vectors for potential role fillers in the context of the
null instantiation could be built in a similar fashion.
The likelihood of a potential filler filling the target
role can then be modelled as the distance between the
meaning vector of the filler and the role in the vec-
tor space model (see Pad´o et al. (2008) for a similar
approach for semi-automatic SRL).
We envisage that the manually annotated null in-
stantiated data can be used to learn additionally
heuristics for the filler resolution task, such as in-
formation about the average distance between a null
instantiation and its most recent co-referent.

<bodyText confidence="0.99997725">
As mentioned above we allow participants to address
either the full role recognition and labelling task plus
the linking of null instantiations or to make use of
the gold standard semantic argument structure and
look only at the null instantiations. We also permit
systems to perform either FrameNet or PropBank
style SRL. Hence, systems can be entered for four
subtasks which will be evaluated separately:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999145">
• full task, FrameNet
• null instantiations, FrameNet
• full task, PropBank
• null instantiations, PropBank
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986631578948">
The focus for the proposed task is on the null in-
stantiation linking, however, for completeness, we
also evaluate the standard SRL task. For role recogni-
tion and labelling we use a standard evaluation set-up,
i.e., for role recognition we will evaluate the accuracy
with respect to the manually created gold standard,
for role labelling we will evaluate precision, recall,
and F-Score.
The null instantiation linkings are evaluated
slightly differently. In the gold standard, we will iden-
tify referents for null instantiations in the discourse
context. In some cases, more than one referent might
be appropriate, e.g., because the omitted argument
refers to an entity that is mentioned multiple times
in the context. In this case, a system should be given
credit if the null instantiation is linked to any of these
expressions. To achieve this we create equivalence
sets for the referents of null instantiations. If the null
instantiation is linked to any item in the equivalence
set, the link is counted as a true positive. We can then
define NI linking precision as the number of all true
positive links divided by the number of links made by
a system, and NI linking recall as the number of true
positive links divided by the number of links between
a null instantiation and its equivalence set in the gold
standard. NI linking F-Score is then the harmonic
mean between NI linking precision and recall.
Since it may sometimes be difficult to determine
the correct extend of the filler of an NI, we score
an automatic annotation as correct if it includes the
head of the gold standard filler in the predicted filler.
However, in order to not favour systems which link
NIs to excessively large spans of text to maximise the
likelihood of linking to a correct referent, we intro-
duce a second evaluation measure, which computes
the overlap (Dice coefficient) between the words in
the predicted filler (P) of a null instantiation and the
words in the gold standard one (G):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.420195">
P n G|�
NI linking overlap = 2 21 |P |+ |G |(6)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.98194365">
Example (7) illustrates this point. The verb won in
the second sentence evokes the Finish competition
frame whose COMPETITION role is null instantiated.
From the context it is clear that the competition role
is semantically filled by their first TV debate (head:
debate) and last night’s debate (head: debate) in
the previous sentences. These two expressions make
up the equivalence set for the COMPETITION role in
the last sentence. Any system that would predict a
linkage to a filler that covers the head of either of
these two expressions would score a true positive for
this NI. However, a system that linked to last night’s
debate would have an NI linking overlap of 1 (i.e.,
2*3/(3+3)) while a system linking the whole second
sentence Last night’s debate was eagerly anticipated
to the NI would have an NI linking overlap of 0.67
(i.e., 2*3/(6+3))

In this paper, we described the SemEval-2010 shared
task on “Linking Events and Their Participants in
Discourse”. With this task, we intend to take a first
step towards viewing semantic role labelling not as a
sentence internal problem but as a task which should
really take the discourse context into account. Specif-
ically, we focus on finding referents for roles which
are null instantiated in the local context. This is po-
tentially useful for various NLP applications. We
believe that the task is timely and interesting for a
number of researchers not only from the semantic
role labelling community but also from fields such as
co-reference resolution or information extraction.
While our task focuses specifically on finding links
between null instantiated roles and the discourse con-
text, we hope that in setting it up, we can stimulate re-
search on the interaction between discourse structure
and semantic argument structure in general. Possible
future editions of the task could then focus on addi-
tional connections between local semantic argument
structures (e.g., linking argument structures that refer
to the same event).

<abstract confidence="0.9946425625">In this paper, we describe the SemEval-2010 shared task on “Linking Events and Their Participants in Discourse”. This task is a variant of the classical semantic role labelling task. The novel aspect is that we focus on linking local semantic argument structures across sentence boundaries. Specifically, the task aims at linking locally uninstantiated roles to their coreferents in the wider discourse context (if such co-referents exist). This task is potentially beneficial for a number of NLP applications and we hope that it will not only attract researchers from the semantic role labelling community but also from co-reference resolution and information extraction.</abstract>

However, semantic role labelling as it is currently defined also misses a lot of information that would be beneficial for NLP applications that deal with text understanding (in the broadest sense), such as information extraction, summarisation, or question answering. The reason for this is that SRL has traditionally been viewed as a sentence-internal task. Hence, relations between different local semantic argument structures are disregarded and this leads to a loss of important semantic information. This view of SRL as a sentence-internal task is partly due to the fact that large-scale manua</context>

Section 5 provides a short description of how null instantiations could be resolved automatically given the provided data. Finally, Section 6 discusses the evaluation measures and we wrap up in Section 7. 2 Background on Null Instantiation The theory of null complementation used here is the one adopted by FrameNet, which derives from the work of Fillmore (1986).3 Briefly, omissions of core arguments of predicates are categorised along two dimensions, the licensor and the interpretation they receive. The idea of a licensor refers to the fact that either a particular lexical item or a particular grammatical construction must be present for the omission of a frame element (FE) to occur. For instance, the omission of the agent in (4) is licensed by the passive construction. (4) No doubt, mistakes were made 0Protagonist. The omission is a constructional omission because it can apply to any predicate with an appropriate semantics that allows it to combine</context>

The morphology of overt instances of an FE could be inspected in the FrameNet data, or if the predicate has only one sense or a very dominant one, then the frequencies could even be estimated from unannotated corpora. The third step is linking definite omissions to referents in the context. This linking problem could be modelled as a co-reference resolution task. While the work of Palmer et al. (1986) relied on special lexicons, one might instead want to learn information about the semantic content of different role fillers and then assess for each of the potential referents in the discourse context whether their semantic content is close enough to the expected content of the null instantiated role. Information about the likely fillers of a role can be obtained from annotated data sets (e.g., FrameNet or PropBank).

The state-of-the-art in semantic role labelling has now advanced so much that a number of studies have shown that automatically inferred semantic argument structures Martha Palmer Department of Linguistics University of Colorado at Boulder martha.palmer@colorado.edu can lead to tangible performance gains in NLP applications such as information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003), question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007) or recognising textual entailment (Burchardt and Frank, 2006). However, semantic role labelling as it is currently defined also misses a lot of information that would be beneficial for NLP applications that deal with text understanding (in the broadest sense), such as information extraction, summarisation, or question answering. The reason for this is that SRL has traditionally been viewed as a sentence-internal task. Hence, relations between different local semantic argument structures are disregarded and this leads to a loss of important semantic information. This view of SRL as a sentence-</context>
