This paper discusses interactions between
negative concord and restructuring/clause
union in Palestinian Arabic. Analyses
formulated in Tree Adjoining Grammar
and Combinatorial Categorial Grammar
are compared, with the conclusion that a
perspicuous analysis of the the intricacies
of the data requires aspects of both for-

1 Palestinian Arabic Negative Concord
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999340181818182">
In Palestinian Arabic (PA), negative concord oc-
curs with the determiner wEla “(not) even one,”
where negative concord describes the failure of an
expression which expresses negation in some sen-
tences to do so in others. Phrases formed with
wEla (“wEla-phrases”) are interpreted either as
negative quantifiers (“NQ-wEla)” or as polarity-
sensitive indefinites (“NPI-wEla”). wEla-phrases
have an NQ-interpretation preceding the finite
verb or verb complex in a clause (1-2) or in frag-
ment answers (3-4):

A preverbal wEla-phrase preceding a sentential

“There wasn’t one day the food didn’t please me!”
“The food pleased me every day.”
NQ-wEla never occurs within the scope of nega-

are not “thematically entailed” by the verb (6-7)1:

1.1 Negative Concord and Locality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999524666666667">
PA negative concord is generally subject to strict
locality constraints: a wela-phrase must be con-
tained within the smallest inflected clause contain-
ing its licensor. It cannot be separated from its li-
censor by the boundary of either an indicative (11)
or a subjunctive/irrealis (12) complement:

This suggests that negative concord is a strictly
bounded dependency like agreement marking, ar-
gument realization, or reflexive binding.
However, there are exceptions to this general-
ization. “Long-distance” negative concord is pos-
sible between a matrix negation morpheme and
wela-phrases inside the complements of a small
class of verbs, including bıdd- “want” (15), Xalla
“to allow” (16), h˙a:wal “to try” (17, 25 below) or
fırıf “to know how to, to be able to” (18 below):

tive concord is identified as a restructuring phe-
nomenon in several languages such as West Flem-
ish (Haegeman and Zanuttini, 1996), Polish (Dzi-
wirek, 1998), and Serbian (Progovac, 2000). As
such, I assume for now that long-distance negative
concord in PA is a form of restructuring as well.

2 A TAG Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996075315789474">
Restructuring involves a seeming paradox involv-
ing a dependency which is non-local in the hier-
archical structure of a sentence but local in its se-
mantics. Tree Adjoining Grammars are well suited
for analyzing restructuring because the distinction
between a derived tree and the derivation tree asso-
ciated with it provides two notions of locality. Re-
structuring phenomena which have been analyzed
with TAGs include clitic-climbing in Spanish and
Italian (Bleam, 2000; Kulick, 2000), long-distance
scrambling in German (Rambow, 1994), and long-
distance agreement in Tsez (Frank, 2006). It there-
fore is natural to explore a TAG analysis for long-
distance negative concord in PA.
To illustrate with a simple example, the nega-
tive concord dependency in (18) is licensed within
an initial tree headed by ektıb “write,” and is
then “stretched” by adjunction of the auxiliary tree
headed by fırıft “I was able to” (19):

These verbs correspond to verbs found in many
other languages which trigger a process often re-
ferred to as restructuring or clause union. I fol-
low (Aissen and Perlmutter, 1983) in calling them
trigger verbs. Restructuring involves the “stretch-
ing” of the domain of locality for certain kinds of
bounded dependencies from the complement of a
trigger verb to include the clause that it heads.
At present no other phenomena have been iden-
tified in PA which independently confirm that it

The locality constraint on negative concord can

derivation tree (20): a wela-phrase and its licen-
sor must be sisters:

2.1 Clause-local Dependencies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998762">
The first property is the domain of locality of the
negative concord dependency. In a simple TAG,
syntactic dependencies are licensed within an ele-
mentary tree: they are tree-local. However, nega-
tive concord in PA is clause-local, because wela-
phrases are not licensed within the immediate tree
to which they are attached, but instead within the
immediate clausal tree containing them. For ex-
ample, wela-phrases can be inside prepositional
phrases attached to a negative clause (21-22):

</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991438423076923">
“You don’t disagree with us about even one thing.”
In a simple TAG analysis, the wela-phrase first
substitutes into the initial tree headed by the
preposition, which is then attached to the clausal
tree. The relationship between the wela-phrase
and its licensor would therefore not be tree-local.
Clause-locality can be modeled with what I
refer to as “Scope TAG” (Kallmeyer and Joshi,
2003), a multi-component TAG (MC-TAG) in
which quantificational NPs are tree sets containing
two parts: a “defective” auxiliary tree IP* which
specifies the scope of the quantifier, and an NP-
tree which specifies its restriction. I refer to such
tree sets as “scope sets.”
While Kallmeyer &amp; Joshi’s proposal is intended
to capture the semantic scope of quantifiers, it can
also be used to express clause locality by assigning
PPs to scope sets as well, and by stipulating that
scope sets can combine with each other by means
of set-local adjunction. The IP*-node in the scope-
set of a wela-phrase can then adjoin to the IP*-
node in the PP scope set, which in turn adjoins to
the IP-node of the initial tree.
For example, (21) above can be analyzed with
the elementary trees in (23) (trees are in abbrevi-
ated form), producing the derivation tree in (24):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9861114">

γ1(00) δ(00) γ2(02)
α1(00) α2(02)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999726428571429">
However, given (24) it is still not possible to state
a generalization about negative concord locality in
terms of sisterhood in the derivation tree.
This can be remedied by adopting the “node-
sharing” relation proposed by (Kallmeyer, 2005).
Informally, two nodes α and Q are in a node-
sharing relation in a derivation tree T iff they
are either in a mother-daughter relation in T at
a node address A, or there is a sequence 5 of
nodes N1 ... N,, which is the transitive closure of
a mother-daughter relation in T in which the node
pairs are related in terms of the root node or foot
node in an auxiliary tree.
On this basis, the negative concord locality gen-
eralization is that a wela-phrase and its licensor
are “shared-node sisters” in the derivation tree,
where shared-node sisters are two nodes A and B
which are each in a shared-node relation with a
single node C. For example, in (24) Q is a shared-
node parent of both α1 and S. Accordingly, α1
and 6 are shared-node sisters with respect to Q.

2.2 Trigger Verbs and Complement Type
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999711916666667">
The second property of PA long-distance negative
concord that complicates a TAG analysis has to
do with the kinds of complement that they take.
TAG approaches to restructuring exploit “reduced
complement” analyses in which trigger verbs take
“smaller” complements than other kinds of sub-
ordinating verbs do (Bleam, 2000; Kulick, 2000).
However, PA trigger verbs are mixed in terms of
the types of complements they take: ha:wal “try
to” or k�ıdır “be able to” optionally allow a com-
plementizer ?ınn- (25-26), while bıdd- “want” or
4ırıf “know to, be able to” exclude it (27-28):

Assuming that the presence of a complementizer
indicates a CP category, and that the presence of
agreement marking on the verb indicates an IP cat-
egory, what these data show is that some trigger
verbs allow either CP or IP complements, while
others allow only IP complements. It follows that
complement category cannot be exploited as a way
to distinguish trigger verbs from non-trigger verbs.
This is an essential distinction because restruc-
turing is not the only phenomenon which in-
volves adjunction. For example, long-distance A-
dependencies are analyzed in TAG as involving
adjunction of auxiliary trees. (29-30) show that
the same verbs which block long-distance nega-
tive concord allow long-distance A-dependencies,
indicating that they must also be analyzed as auxil-
iary trees. Moreover, (30) can include the comple-
mentizer Pinn-, indicating that it takes the same
kinds of complements as do trigger verbs like
k˙idir “be able” and h˙a:wal “try”:

A failure to distinguish between trigger verbs and
non-trigger verbs will over-predict the availability
of long-distance negative concord.
To make this distinction, I use Dowty’s (Dowty,
1994) analysis of negative concord licensing.
Dowty models negative concord with a “polarity”
feature which takes “+” or “-” values. When a neg-
ative concord item combines with a clausal cate-
gory it specifies (by unification) the clause as hav-
ing a negative value for this feature. In addition,
Dowty assumes that root clauses must have a pos-
itive value for the feature: I refer to this as the root
clause polarity constraint. Negation morphemes
(as well as bidu:n “without”) take a complement
specified as POL- and return a constituent with a
POL+ feature. A root clause containing a negative
concord item and lacking a negation morpheme
will have a POL- feature for its root node and vio-
late the root clause polarity constraint. This de-
rives the requirement that wela phrases in root
clauses be “roofed” by a negation morpheme.
Turning to long-distance negative concord, trig-
ger verbs can be distinguished from non-trigger
verbs by stipulating that non-trigger verbs take
POL+ complements, while trigger verbs (and aux-
iliary verbs) impose no polarity specification and
instead inherit the polarity feature with which their
complement is specified2. An analysis of this kind
applied to (18) would result in a derived tree (32)
which satisfies the root clause polarity constraint.

2.3 Negation Morphology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881285714286">
The last property of long-distance negative con-
cord sentences to be dealt with has to do with
negation morphology in PA. Negation is expressed
with some combination of the proclitic ma:- and
the enclitic -&amp;quot;s. -&amp;quot;s appears to be a second-position
attaching to the first word-sized constituent in the
string produced by an IP-constituent, provided that
the word contains a morpheme expressing person
features (Awwad, 1987; Eid, 1993).
The most frequent distribution has -&amp;quot;s attached
to the leftmost verb stem in a clause, which may
be the main verb in a mono-verbal predicate (33),
or to the leftmost auxiliary in a clause with com-
pound tense-aspect-mood marking (34-35):

What these expressions all have in common with
verb stems is that they occur as the first constituent
in the clause and that they all contain a morpheme

To sum up, a TAG analysis can be formulated
for PA long-distance negative concord which al-
lows the locality of negative concord licensing to
be stated as a generalization about shared-node
derivation trees. However, the analysis requires
brute force stipulations to capture the morpholog-
ical expression of negation in PA negative sen-

The TAG analysis has difficulty accommodating
the distribution of -&amp;quot;s because TAG trees are phrase
structures, making it difficult to state constraints
on strings of words rather than on hierarchical
structure. Categorial Grammar, on the other hand,
is a string calculus, and its operations result in
string concatenation rather than structure expan-
sion. For this reason, a CG can be constrained to
not generate particular kinds of strings, rather than

state constraints on the distribution of -&amp;quot;s more di-
rectly than a phrase-structure grammar does.
I assume a Combinatory Categorial Gram-
mar (Steedman, 1996; Steedman, 2000b;
Baldridge, 2002). The basis of the CCG analysis
is that npI-wEla-phrases are treated as type-raised
categories which look for an s category to their
left. I continue following Dowty in assuming the
root clause polarity principle and in assuming
that wEla-phrases specify a POL- feature on
the s-headed category that they combine with.
NQ-wEla phrases, on the other hand, are treated as
negative quantifiers which look for their s-headed
argument to the right:

The -&amp;quot;s morpheme fixes a clause with a POL-
feature, while ma:- takes the POL- clausal cate-
gory and changes its value for the polarity feature
to POL+, satisfying the root clause polarity con-
straint. This works much as the TAG analysis did.
The slash in the type for -&amp;quot;s is marked with the
“crossed composition” modality. This allows -&amp;quot;s to
combine with a preceding s-headed category while
returning a category looking for its arguments to
the right (Figures 1-2)4.
Turning to long-distance negative concord, a
CCG analysis, like the TAG analysis above, has
to account for the distinction between trigger
verbs and non-trigger verbs. The CCG analog of
auxiliary-tree adjunction is function composition.
The long-distance negative concord dependency
therefore involves a specific kind of composition
subject to stricter constraints than is the more gen-
eral kind which produces A-dependencies.
In order to model this, I adapt Hepple’s (Hep-
ple, 1990) approach to modeling island constraints

in Categorial Type Logic. In brief, Hepple’s ap-
proach is to assign unary modalities to the argu-
ments of clausal categories (such as subordinat-
ing verbs or relative pronouns) as well as to the
nominal argument of a type-raised extracted cate-
gory (such as a question word or topicalized noun
phrase). The former are referred to as “bounding
modalities,” and the latter as “penetrative modal-
ities.” Interaction axioms require the penetrative
modality of an extraction category to be compati-
ble with the bounding category of its argument in
terms of a type hierarchy defined over modalities.
The unary modalities in CTL can be duplicated
in CCG as features on category labels, so to ap-
proximate Hepple’s proposal, I define a feature hi-
erarchy as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.3599325">
(51) h

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.968151225806452">
Each pair of sisters in the hierarchy consists of a
“penetrative feature” and the “bounding feature”
which blocks it (following Hepple’s terminology).
The feature c is an penetrative feature which is
blocked by the g feature, and h is the most gen-
eral or permissive bounding feature.
The idea is that categories which participate in
restructuring dependencies are marked with the c
penetrative feature, which is spread across all the
arguments of a complex type:
(52) wEla h˙ada :- Sc$\(Sc$/NPc)
Trigger verbs impose the h bounding feature on
their complements, while non-trigger embedding
verbs impose the g feature:
(53) bıdd- “want,” Qırıf “be able to,” h˙a:wal “try to” :-
S\NP/(Sh\NPh)
(54) waQad-yu:Qıd “promise to” :- S\NP/(Sg\NPg)
According to (51), categories marked with fea-
ture h are compatible with categories marked with
feature c, while categories marked with feature g
clash with it. The clash between g and c expresses
the restriction on restructuring dependencies.
For example, in an analysis of (18), wEla kılmi
applies to the composed constituent, Qırıft Ektıb.
This is possible because the penetrative feature
c on the wEla-phrase is compatible with the h
bounding feature which Qırıft passes to its com-
plement (Figure 3).
Long-distance negative concord is blocked in
two ways. A wide-scope derivation (in which the
wEla-phrase combines with the composition of the

ture clash between the g and c features (Figure
4). A narrow scope derivation (in which the wela-
phrase combines with the embedded verb only)
is blocked because of a resulting clash in polar-
ity features between the embedded clause and the
matrix verb (Figure 5).

While the TAG analysis imposes certain limita-
tions on the ordering of morphemes, it does pro-
vide a very simple and intuitive way to describe
restructuring verbs as a natural class that includes
auxiliary verbs, the other kinds of verb stems
which are “transparent” to negative concord. In
contrast, The CCG analysis has a technical flavor,
and it is not clear to what extent it reflects a lin-
guistic intuition. The CCG analysis does, how-
ever, capture the distribution of the negation mor-
phemes in PA. It would therefore be interesting
to explore further whether the Hepple-style fea-
ture/modality approach could be associated with
some linguistic phenomenon.
One interesting possibility would be to use
Steedman’s theory of intonation (Steedman,
2000a) to explore the prosodic properties of re-
structuring sentences in Arabic (and in other lan-
guages) to see whether the availability of restruc-
turing correlates with certain prosodic properties.
There has been very little study of sentential into-
nation in Arabic, and so very little empirical ba-
sis for an investigation. However, should such an
investigation bear fruit, it might suggest that Hep-
ple’s approach to extraction constraints could be
recast as a theory of intonation. This would allow
powerful generalizations to be stated relating the
prosodic properties of sentences in PA and other
languages to their syntactic properties.

Analyses formulated in Tree Adjoining Grammar and Combinatorial Categorial Grammar are compared, with the conclusion that a perspicuous analysis of the the intricacies of the data requires aspects of both formalisms; in particular, the TAG notion of the extended domain of locality and the CCG notion of flexible constituency. 1 Palestinian Arabic Negative Concord In Palestinian Arabic (PA), negative concord ocwith the determiner “(not) even one,” where negative concord describes the failure of an expression which expresses negation in some sentences to do so in others. Phrases formed with are interpreted either as quantifiers or as polarityindefinites have an NQ-interpretation preceding the finite verb or verb complex in a clause (1-2) or in fragment answers (3-4): “Not even ONE of them saw me!” (2) wEla yo:m Qaˇgabni not.even day pleased.3ms-me the-food “There wasn’t even one day the food pleased me!” Q: what said.3ms-to-you not.even thing “What did he say to you? Nothing at all.” Q: who “Who did you see? Not even a two-day old chick!” preverbal preceding a sentential negation marker causes the sentence to have a double-negation reading (5: compare with 2): yo:m ma-Qaˇgabni l-Ekıl. not.even day not-pleased.3ms-me the-food “There wasn’t one day the food didn’t please me!” “The food pleased me every day.” never occurs within the scope of negation but does occur in post-verbal positions which not “thematically entailed” by the verb he “He is NOTHING!” ma˙gru:ra she conceited.fs “She is conceited for absolutely NO reason!” The NPI-interpretation is only available within the scope of antimorphic operators (Zwarts, 1993), sentential negation or “without” (8-9): left.2fs “You left without saying even one thing!” to-the-year not-give.1s-them “Up to a year I don’t give them even a bite of [solid] food.” than one can have the NPIinterpretation at a time: iˇsi wEla one fi:-hUm. thing to-even in-them “I didn’t give anything at all to even one of them.” It follows from the distributions of NQand NPIthat are blocked from postverbal argument positions which are thematically entailed and which are not within the scope of an antimorphic operator. (Herburger, 2001), “thematically entailed” means that the meaning of the verb entails the existence of an entity filling the thematic role in question. ˇsUfti? not.even su:s ıbn yome:n. saw.2fs son two-days iˇsi! thing wEla not.even Qala upon wEla not.even iˇsi. thing bıdu:n-ma say.2fs wEla iˇsi. without-that even thing Ekl. food bite wElla even not.even one.MS fi:-hUm in-them ˇsæ:f-ni. saw.3ms-me wEla not-said.1s even 49 of the 8th International Workshop on Tree Adjoining Grammar and Related pages July 2006. Association for Computational Linguistics 1.1 Negative Concord and Locality PA negative concord is generally subject to strict constraints: a must be contained within the smallest inflected clause containing its licensor. It cannot be separated from its licensor by the boundary of either an indicative (11) or a subjunctive/irrealis (12) complement: * believe.1s-neg Similar sentences with weaker polarity items such or “anyone” are acceptable: (13) ma-wafatt not-promised.1s “I didn’t promise to talk with any of them.” This suggests that negative concord is a strictly bounded dependency like agreement marking, argument realization, or reflexive binding. However, there are exceptions to this generalization. “Long-distance” negative concord is possible between a matrix negation morpheme and inside the complements of a small of verbs, including bıdd- “want” (15), allow” (16), “to try” (17, 25 below) or “to know how to, to be able to” (18 below): nXalli not-want.1s leave.1p “We don’t want to leave even one man.” æ:kOl wela not-allowed.3mp-me-neg eat.1s even bite “They wouldn’t let me eat even one bite!” The embedding can be recursive, provided that only verbs in this class are used (17). has restructuring. However, long-distance negative concord is identified as a restructuring phenomenon in several languages such as West Flemish (Haegeman and Zanuttini, 1996), Polish (Dziwirek, 1998), and Serbian (Progovac, 2000). As such, I assume for now that long-distance negative concord in PA is a form of restructuring as well. 2 A TAG Analysis Restructuring involves a seeming paradox involving a dependency which is non-local in the hierarchical structure of a sentence but local in its semantics. Tree Adjoining Grammars are well suited for analyzing restructuring because the distinction between a derived tree and the derivation tree associated with it provides two notions of locality. Restructuring phenomena which have been analyzed with TAGs include clitic-climbing in Spanish and Italian (Bleam, 2000; Kulick, 2000), long-distance scrambling in German (Rambow, 1994), and longdistance agreement in Tsez (Frank, 2006). It therefore is natural to explore a TAG analysis for longdistance negative concord in PA. To illustrate with a simple example, the negative concord dependency in (18) is licensed within initial tree headed by “write,” and is then “stretched” by adjunction of the auxiliary tree by “I was able to” (19): * ]. wela even one maf with not-promised.1s talk fi:-hUm in-them (18) ma-Qırıft ektıb not-knew.1s write.1s “I wasn’t able to write even one word.” (19) IP* wela even kılmi. word [ ınnhæ that.3fs likes.3fs wela even one ]. talk fi:-hUm. in-them one maQ with ( ?aiy any “I don’t think that she likes ANY one.” ınnhæ ( ?aiy believe.1s-neg that.3fs likes.3fs any one wela even zelami. fellow speak.1s wela even maQ with one want.1s-neg try.1s “I don’t want try to talk with anyone at all.” These verbs correspond to verbs found in many other languages which trigger a process often referred to as restructuring or clause union. I follow (Aissen and Perlmutter, 1983) in calling them trigger verbs. Restructuring involves the “stretching” of the domain of locality for certain kinds of bounded dependencies from the complement of a trigger verb to include the clause that it heads. At present no other phenomena have been identified in PA which independently confirm that it kılmi The locality constraint on negative concord can then be expressed as a generalization about the tree (20): a and its licensor must be sisters: However, several properties of negative concord in PA preclude a simple analysis like this. 50 2.1 Clause-local Dependencies The first property is the domain of locality of the negative concord dependency. In a simple TAG, syntactic dependencies are licensed within an elementary tree: they are tree-local. However, negaconcord in PA is clause-local, because phrases are not licensed within the immediate tree to which they are attached, but instead within the immediate clausal tree containing them. For excan be inside prepositional phrases attached to a negative clause (21-22): (21) ma-kaQatt not-sat.1s “I didn’t sit next to even one of them.” bıtXallıfu:-ˇs Qan-na isi ]. disagree.2mp-neg from-us with-even thing “You don’t disagree with us about even one thing.” a simple TAG analysis, the first substitutes into the initial tree headed by the preposition, which is then attached to the clausal The relationship between the and its licensor would therefore not be tree-local. Clause-locality can be modeled with what I refer to as “Scope TAG” (Kallmeyer and Joshi, 2003), a multi-component TAG (MC-TAG) in which quantificational NPs are tree sets containing two parts: a “defective” auxiliary tree IP* which specifies the scope of the quantifier, and an NPtree which specifies its restriction. I refer to such tree sets as “scope sets.” While Kallmeyer &amp; Joshi’s proposal is intended to capture the semantic scope of quantifiers, it can also be used to express clause locality by assigning PPs to scope sets as well, and by stipulating that scope sets can combine with each other by means of set-local adjunction. The IP*-node in the scopeof a can then adjoin to the IP*node in the PP scope set, which in turn adjoins to the IP-node of the initial tree. For example, (21) above can be analyzed with the elementary trees in (23) (trees are in abbreviated form), producing the derivation tree in (24): NP a. hada However, given (24) it is still not possible to state a generalization about negative concord locality in terms of sisterhood in the derivation tree. This can be remedied by adopting the “nodesharing” relation proposed by (Kallmeyer, 2005). two nodes in a noderelation in a derivation tree they either in a mother-daughter relation in node address or there is a sequence is the transitive closure of mother-daughter relation in which the node pairs are related in terms of the root node or foot node in an auxiliary tree. On this basis, the negative concord locality genis that a and its licensor are “shared-node sisters” in the derivation tree, shared-node sisters are two nodes which are each in a shared-node relation with a node For example, in (24) a sharedparent of both Accordingly, shared-node sisters with respect to 2.2 Trigger Verbs and Complement Type The second property of PA long-distance negative concord that complicates a TAG analysis has to do with the kinds of complement that they take. TAG approaches to restructuring exploit “reduced complement” analyses in which trigger verbs take “smaller” complements than other kinds of subordinating verbs do (Bleam, 2000; Kulick, 2000). However, PA trigger verbs are mixed in terms of types of complements they take: “try or “be able to” optionally allow a com- (25-26), while bıdd- “want” or “know to, be able to” exclude it (27-28): not-tried.1s “I didn’t try to talk with even one of them.” next.to wEla even one fi:-hUm in-them ] ( immi that.1s speak.1s wEla even maQ with one ( Mmi that.1s speak.1s wEla even maQ with one not-could.1s “I wasn’t able to speak with even one of them.” not-want.1s-neg ( *immi that.1s ) aˇsu:f see.1s wEla even one “I don’t want to see even ONE of them.” ( *immi not-knww.1s that.1s “I wan’t able to write even one word.” wEla even ) Ektıb write.1s kılmi. word IP IP* 51 Assuming that the presence of a complementizer indicates a CP category, and that the presence of agreement marking on the verb indicates an IP category, what these data show is that some trigger verbs allow either CP or IP complements, while others allow only IP complements. It follows that complement category cannot be exploited as a way to distinguish trigger verbs from non-trigger verbs. This is an essential distinction because restructuring is not the only phenomenon which involves adjunction. For example, long-distance Adependencies are analyzed in TAG as involving adjunction of auxiliary trees. (29-30) show that the same verbs which block long-distance negative concord allow long-distance A-dependencies, indicating that they must also be analyzed as auxiliary trees. Moreover, (30) can include the compleindicating that it takes the same kinds of complements as do trigger verbs like “be able” and “try”: “Who do you think will get the World Cup?” ınnak ) what promised.2ms that.2ms give.2ms-her “What did you promise to give her?” A failure to distinguish between trigger verbs and non-trigger verbs will over-predict the availability of long-distance negative concord. To make this distinction, I use Dowty’s (Dowty, 1994) analysis of negative concord licensing. Dowty models negative concord with a “polarity” feature which takes “+” or “-” values. When a negative concord item combines with a clausal category it specifies (by unification) the clause as having a negative value for this feature. In addition, Dowty assumes that root clauses must have a positive value for the feature: I refer to this as the root clause polarity constraint. Negation morphemes well as “without”) take a complement as and return a constituent with a feature. A root clause containing a negative concord item and lacking a negation morpheme have a feature for its root node and violate the root clause polarity constraint. This dethe requirement that phrases in root clauses be “roofed” by a negation morpheme. Turning to long-distance negative concord, trigger verbs can be distinguished from non-trigger verbs by stipulating that non-trigger verbs take complements, while trigger verbs (and auxiliary verbs) impose no polarity specification and instead inherit the polarity feature with which their is An analysis of this kind applied to (18) would result in a derived tree (32) which satisfies the root clause polarity constraint. kilmi 2.3 Negation Morphology The last property of long-distance negative concord sentences to be dealt with has to do with negation morphology in PA. Negation is expressed some combination of the proclitic and the enclitic -&amp;quot;s. -&amp;quot;s appears to be a second-position attaching to the first word-sized constituent in the string produced by an IP-constituent, provided that the word contains a morpheme expressing person features (Awwad, 1987; Eid, 1993). The most frequent distribution has -&amp;quot;s attached to the leftmost verb stem in a clause, which may be the main verb in a mono-verbal predicate (33), or to the leftmost auxiliary in a clause with compound tense-aspect-mood marking (34-35): fi-l-le:l. not-slept.1s-neg in-the-night “I didn’t sleep last night.” Qa:rıf we:n not-was.1s-neg know.actpart.ms where put.1s-it “I didn’t know where to put it.” Pınnu not-returned.3ms-neg said.3ms-to-me that.3ms ˇstara sayya:ra. bought.3ms car “He didn’t tell me anymore that he bought a car.” is similar to Frank’s (Frank, 2006) proposal for analyzing long-distance agreement in Tsez. kilmi who kæ:s cup ıl-Qæ:lım? the-world get.3ms Qala upon 52 In other kinds of sentences, -&amp;quot;s attaches to a variety of non-verbal expressions, including the indefinite “(any)one” (36), the existential parinflected prepositions (38), and the “ever” (39): kæ:n yıQˇgır-na. not-one.ms-neg was.3ms rent.3ms-us “No one would rent to us.” “There isn’t [anything] in the world like them.” fi-d-dınya not-exist-neg in-the-word mıpıl-hın. like-them.fp (43) IP IP IP* IP I VP I I NP faras ma-lhæ:-ˇs UXt. mare not-to-her-neg sister “He had a mare [that was] without compare.” (39) næ:s people.3fs ma-QUmr-hæ:-ˇs not-age-3fs-neg put.3fs subject exist fi-l-mUntada. in-the-club “There are people who have never posted a thread What these expressions all have in common with verb stems is that they occur as the first constituent in the clause and that they all contain a morpheme expressing person features. It follows that -&amp;quot;s is constrained to occur in the second position attached to a word that is inflected for person. The cases in which -&amp;quot;s attaches to a verb can be by assuming that and -&amp;quot;s are part of a tree set and that -&amp;quot;s adjoins to right of an I-node: -&amp;quot;s ma:- IP* I (41) IP IP IP* IP I PP nımt the preceding word and blocks use of : in (40): (Hussein, 1990), one of a small set of verb stems which function as aspectual adverbs and which with the main verb in aspectual form and agreement marking. Serial auxiliaries are plausibly analyzed as adverbial IP-auxiliary “serialauxiliary” “agree” trees as in (44): The cases with -&amp;quot;s attached to anon-verbal expression require a second analysis. One possibility is to assume a second tree for -&amp;quot;s like the first, except with -&amp;quot;s preceding the foot node. This requires stipulating amorphological output filter that affixes -&amp;quot;s (42) yıQˇgırna This is still not adaquate for (35), in which -&amp;quot;s is attached to a (44) IP The structure resulting from (44) has two I-nodes, and another constraint would have to be stipulated forcing -&amp;quot;s to adjoin to the leftmost of the two. To sum up, a TAG analysis can be formulated for PA long-distance negative concord which allows the locality of negative concord licensing to be stated as a generalization about shared-node derivation trees. However, the analysis requires brute force stipulations to capture the morphological expression of negation in PA negative sentences. Moreover, the TAG analysis does not provide away to express the simple morphological generalization that -&amp;quot;s fall s in the second position in the string generated by the clause. 3 A CCG Analysis The TAG analysis has difficulty accommodating the distribution of -&amp;quot;s because TAG trees are phrase structures, making it difficult to state constraints on strings of words rather than on hierarchical structure. Categorial Grammar, on the other hand, is a string calculus, and its operations result in string concatenation rather than structure expansion. For this reason, a CG can be constrained to not generate particular kinds of strings, rather than I IP* IP IP 53 particular trees. A CG therefore provides a way to state constraints on the distribution of -&amp;quot;s more directly than a phrase-structure grammar does. I assume a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 1996; Steedman, 2000b; Baldridge, 2002). The basis of the CCG analysis that are treated as type-raised categories which look for an s category to their left. I continue following Dowty in assuming the root clause polarity principle and in assuming specify a feature on the s-headed category that they combine with. phrases, on the other hand, are treated as negative quantifiers which look for their s-headed argument to the right: (45) : (46) : The negation morphemes are treated as follows (-&amp;quot;s is semantically vacuous): (47) :- : (48) have the following (49) : (50) : -&amp;quot;s morpheme fixes a clause with a while takes the clausal category and changes its value for the polarity feature satisfying the root clause polarity constraint. This works much as the TAG analysis did. The slash in the type for -&amp;quot;s is marked with the “crossed composition” modality. This allows -&amp;quot;s to combine with a preceding s-headed category while returning a category looking for its arguments to right (Figures Turning to long-distance negative concord, a CCG analysis, like the TAG analysis above, has to account for the distinction between trigger verbs and non-trigger verbs. The CCG analog of auxiliary-tree adjunction is function composition. The long-distance negative concord dependency therefore involves a specific kind of composition subject to stricter constraints than is the more general kind which produces A-dependencies. In order to model this, I adapt Hepple’s (Hepple, 1990) approach to modeling island constraints type assignments ignore the representation of VS word order and pro-drop sentences. forms are surpressed in the derivations. in Categorial Type Logic. In brief, Hepple’s approach is to assign unary modalities to the arguments of clausal categories (such as subordinating verbs or relative pronouns) as well as to the nominal argument of a type-raised extracted category (such as a question word or topicalized noun phrase). The former are referred to as “bounding modalities,” and the latter as “penetrative modalities.” Interaction axioms require the penetrative modality of an extraction category to be compatible with the bounding category of its argument in terms of a type hierarchy defined over modalities. The unary modalities in CTL can be duplicated in CCG as features on category labels, so to approximate Hepple’s proposal, I define a feature hierarchy as follows: (51) h g c Each pair of sisters in the hierarchy consists of a “penetrative feature” and the “bounding feature” which blocks it (following Hepple’s terminology). The feature c is an penetrative feature which is blocked by the g feature, and h is the most general or permissive bounding feature. The idea is that categories which participate in restructuring dependencies are marked with the c penetrative feature, which is spread across all the arguments of a complex type: (52) Trigger verbs impose the h bounding feature on their complements, while non-trigger embedding verbs impose the g feature: bıddable to,” to” :- (54) to” :- According to (51), categories marked with feature h are compatible with categories marked with feature c, while categories marked with feature g clash with it. The clash between g and c expresses the restriction on restructuring dependencies. example, in an analysis of (18), kılmi to the composed constituent, This is possible because the penetrative feature on the is compatible with the h feature which passes to its complement (Figure 3). Long-distance negative concord is blocked in two ways. A wide-scope derivation (in which the combines with the composition of the 54 matrix and embedded verbs) is blocked by a feature clash between the g and c features (Figure A narrow scope derivation (in which the phrase combines with the embedded verb only) is blocked because of a resulting clash in polarity features between the embedded clause and the matrix verb (Figure 5). 4 Comparison and Discussion While the TAG analysis imposes certain limitations on the ordering of morphemes, it does provide a very simple and intuitive way to describe restructuring verbs as a natural class that includes auxiliary verbs, the other kinds of verb stems which are “transparent” to negative concord. In contrast, The CCG analysis has a technical flavor, and it is not clear to what extent it reflects a linguistic intuition. The CCG analysis does, however, capture the distribution of the negation morphemes in PA. It would therefore be interesting to explore further whether the Hepple-style feature/modality approach could be associated with some linguistic phenomenon. One interesting possibility would be to use Steedman’s theory of intonation (Steedman, 2000a) to explore the prosodic properties of restructuring sentences in Arabic (and in other languages) to see whether the availability of restructuring correlates with certain prosodic properties. There has been very little study of sentential intonation in Arabic, and so very little empirical basis for an investigation. However, should such an investigation bear fruit, it might suggest that Hepple’s approach to extraction constraints could be recast as a theory of intonation. This would allow powerful generalizations to be stated relating the prosodic properties of sentences in PA and other languages to their syntactic properties.</abstract>

As such, I assume for now that long-distance negative concord in PA is a form of restructuring as well. 2 A TAG Analysis Restructuring involves a seeming paradox involving a dependency which is non-local in the hierarchical structure of a sentence but local in its semantics. Tree Adjoining Grammars are well suited for analyzing restructuring because the distinction between a derived tree and the derivation tree associated with it provides two notions of locality. Restructuring phenomena which have been analyzed with TAGs include clitic-climbing in Spanish and Italian (Bleam, 2000; Kulick, 2000), long-distance scrambling in German (Rambow, 1994), and longdistance agreement in Tsez (Frank, 2006). It therefore is natural to explore a TAG analysis for longdistance negative concord in PA. To illustrate with a simple example, the negative concord dependency in (18) is licensed within an initial tree headed by ektıb “write,” and is then “stretched” by adjunction of the auxiliary tree headed by fırıft “I was able to” (19): (11) * ma-waQatt ]. wela even h˙ada one maf with [ eh˙ki not-promised.1s talk fi:-hUm in-them (18) ma-Qırıft ektıb not-knew.1s write.1s “I wasn’t able to w</context>

For example, in (24) Q is a sharednode parent of both α1 and S. Accordingly, α1 and 6 are shared-node sisters with respect to Q. 2.2 Trigger Verbs and Complement Type The second property of PA long-distance negative concord that complicates a TAG analysis has to do with the kinds of complement that they take. TAG approaches to restructuring exploit “reduced complement” analyses in which trigger verbs take “smaller” complements than other kinds of subordinating verbs do (Bleam, 2000; Kulick, 2000). However, PA trigger verbs are mixed in terms of the types of complements they take: ha:wal “try to” or k�ıdır “be able to” optionally allow a complementizer ?ınn- (25-26), while bıdd- “want” or 4ırıf “know to, be able to” exclude it (27-28): (25) ma-h˙a:walt not-tried.1s “I didn’t try to talk with even one of them.” [PP gam�b wEla h˙ada fi:-hUm ] next.to even one in-them ( immi ) Eh˙ki wEla maQ h˙ada. that.1s speak.1s even with one (26) ma-k˙ıdırt ( Mmi ) Eh˙ki wEla maQ h˙ada. not-could.1s that.1s speak.1s even with one “I wasn’t able to speak with even one of them.” (27) ma-b</context>

To make this distinction, I use Dowty’s (Dowty, 1994) analysis of negative concord licensing. Dowty models negative concord with a “polarity” feature which takes “+” or “-” values. When a negative concord item combines with a clausal category it specifies (by unification) the clause as having a negative value for this feature. In addition, Dowty assumes that root clauses must have a positive value for the feature: I refer to this as the root clause polarity constraint. Negation morphemes (as well as bidu:n “without”) take a complement specified as POL- and return a constituent with a POL+ feature. A root clause containing a negative concord item</context>

Turning to long-distance negative concord, a CCG analysis, like the TAG analysis above, has to account for the distinction between trigger verbs and non-trigger verbs. The CCG analog of auxiliary-tree adjunction is function composition. The long-distance negative concord dependency therefore involves a specific kind of composition subject to stricter constraints than is the more general kind which produces A-dependencies.

In brief, Hepple’s approach is to assign unary modalities to the arguments of clausal categories (such as subordinating verbs or relative pronouns) as well as to the nominal argument of a type-raised extracted category (such as a question word or topicalized noun phrase).

The relationship between the wela-phrase and its licensor would therefore not be tree-local. Clause-locality can be modeled with what I refer to as “Scope TAG” (Kallmeyer and Joshi, 2003), a multi-component TAG (MC-TAG) in which quantificational NPs are tree sets containing two parts: a “defective” auxiliary tree IP* which specifies the scope of the quantifier, and an NPtree which specifies its restriction. I refer to such tree sets as “scope sets.” While Kallmeyer &amp; Joshi’s proposal is intended to capture the semantic scope of quantifiers, it can also be used to express clause locality by assigning PPs to scope sets as well, and by stipulating that scope sets can combine with each other by means of set-local adjunction.

This can be remedied by adopting the “nodesharing” relation proposed by (Kallmeyer, 2005). Informally, two nodes α and Q are in a nodesharing relation in a derivation tree T iff they are either in a mother-daughter relation in T at a node address A, or there is a sequence 5 of nodes N1 ... N,, which is the transitive closure of a mother-daughter relation in T in which the node pairs are related in terms of the root node or foot node in an auxiliary tree. On this basis, the negative concord locality generalization is that a wela-phrase and its licensor are “shared-node sisters” in the derivation tree, where shared-node sisters are two nodes A and B which are each in a shared-node r</context>

TAG approaches to restructuring exploit “reduced complement” analyses in which trigger verbs take “smaller” complements than other kinds of subordinating verbs do (Bleam, 2000; Kulick, 2000).

The CCG analysis does, however, capture the distribution of the negation morphemes in PA. It would therefore be interesting to explore further whether the Hepple-style feature/modality approach could be associated with some linguistic phenomenon. One interesting possibility would be to use Steedman’s theory of intonation (Steedman, 2000a) to explore the prosodic properties of restructuring sentences in Arabic (and in other languages) to see whether the availability of restructuring correlates with certain prosodic properties. There has been very little study of sentential intonation in Arabic, and so very little empirical basis for an investigation. However, should such an investigation bear fruit, it might suggest that Hepple’s approach to extraction constraints could be recast as a theory of intonation.

For this reason, a CG can be constrained to not generate particular kinds of strings, rather than Qad I CPJ, IP* IP IP 53 particular trees. A CG therefore provides a way to state constraints on the distribution of -&amp;quot;s more directly than a phrase-structure grammar does. I assume a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 1996; Steedman, 2000b; Baldridge, 2002). The basis of the CCG analysis is that npI-wEla-phrases are treated as type-raised categories which look for an s category to their left. I continue following Dowty in assuming the root clause polarity principle and in assuming that wEla-phrases specify a POL- feature on the s-headed category that they combine with. NQ-wEla phrases, on the other hand, are treated as negative quantifiers which look for their s-headed argument to the right: (45) NQ-wEla :- (Spol+$/(Spol+\$/NP))/NP : APAQ.3x[P(x) &amp; Q(x)] (46) NPI-wEla :- (Spol−$\(Spol−$/NP))/NP : APAQ._3x[P(x) &amp; Q(x)] The nega</context>

In contrast, The CCG analysis has a technical flavor, and it is not clear to what extent it reflects a linguistic intuition. The CCG analysis does, however, capture the distribution of the negation morphemes in PA. It would therefore be interesting to explore further whether the Hepple-style feature/modality approach could be associated with some linguistic phenomenon. One interesting possibility would be to use Steedman’s theory of intonation (Steedman, 2000a) to explore the prosodic properties of restructuring sentences in Arabic (and in other languages) to see whether the availability of restructuring correlates with certain prosodic properties. There has been very little study of sentential intonation in Arabic, and so very little empirical basis for an investigation. However, should such an investigation bear fruit, it might suggest that Hepple’s approach to extraction constraints could be recast as a theory of intonation. This would allow powerful generalizations to be stated relating the prosodic properties of sentences in PA and other lang</context>
