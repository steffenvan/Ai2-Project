Abstract

Based on linguistic generalizations, we
enhanced an existing semantic processor,
SemRep, for effective interpretation of a
wide range of patterns used to express
arguments of nominalization in clinically
oriented biomedical text. Nominaliza-
tions are pervasive in the scientific litera-
ture, yet few text mining systems ade-
quately address them, thus missing a
wealth of information. We evaluated the
system by assessing the algorithm inde-
pendently and by determining its contri-
bution to SemRep generally. The first
evaluation demonstrated the strength of
the method through an F-score of 0.646
(P=0.743, R=0.569), which is more than
20 points higher than the baseline. The
second evaluation showed that overall
SemRep results were increased to F-score
0.689 (P=0.745, R=0.640), approximate-
ly 25 points better than processing with-
out nominalizations.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999672760869565">
Extracting semantic relations from text and
representing them as predicate-argument struc-
tures is increasingly seen as foundational for
mining the biomedical literature (Kim et al.,
2008). Most research has focused on relations
indicated by verbs (Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004;
Kogan et al., 2005). However nominalizations,
gerunds, and relational nouns also take argu-
ments. For example, the following sentence has
three nominalizations, treatment, suppression,
and lactation (nominalized forms of the verbs
treat, suppress, and lactate, respectively). Agon-
ist is derived from agonize, but indicates an
agent rather than an event.
Bromocriptine, an ergot alkaloid dopamine
agonist, is a recent common treatment for
suppression of lactation in postpartum wom-
en.
In promoting economy of expression, nomina-
lizations are pervasive in scientific discourse,
particularly the molecular biology sublanguage,
due to the highly nested and complex biomolecu-
lar interactions described (Friedman et al., 2002).
However, Cohen et al. (2008) point out that no-
minalizations are more difficult to process than
verbs. Although a few systems deal with them,
the focus is often limited in both the nominaliza-
tions recognized and the patterns used to express
their arguments. Inability to interpret nominal
constructions in a general way limits the effec-
tiveness of such systems, since a wealth of
knowledge is missed.
In this paper, we discuss our recent work on
interpreting nominal forms and their arguments.
We concentrate on nominalizations; however, the
analysis also applies to other argument-taking
nouns. Based on training data, we developed a
set of linguistic generalizations and enhanced an
existing semantic processor, SemRep, for effec-
tive interpretation of a wide range of patterns
used to express arguments of nominalization in
clinically oriented biomedical text. We evaluated
the enhancements in two ways: by examining the
ability to identify arguments of nominals inde-
pendently and the effect these enhancements had
on the overall quality of SemRep output.

The theoretical linguistics literature has ad-
dressed the syntax of nominalizations (e.g.
Chomsky, 1970; Grimshaw, 1990; Grimshaw
and Williams, 1993), however, largely as support
for theoretical argumentation, rather than de-
tailed description of the facts. Quirk et al. (1985)
concentrate on the morphological derivation of

nominalizations from verbs. Within the context
of NomBank, a project dedicated to annotation of
argument structure, Meyers et al. (2004a) de-
scribe the linguistics of nominalizations, empha-
sizing semantic roles. However, major syntactic
patterns of argument realization are also noted.
Cohen et al. (2008) provide a comprehensive
overview of nominalizations in biomedical text.
They include a review of the relevant literature,
and discuss a range of linguistic considerations,
including morphological derivation, passiviza-
tion, transitivity, and semantic topics (e.g.
agent/instrument (activator) vs. ac-
tion/process/state (activation)). Based on an
analysis of the PennBioIE corpus (Kulick et al.,
2004), detailed distributional results are provided
on alternation patterns for several nominaliza-
tions with high frequency of occurrence in bio-
medical text, such as activation and treatment.
In computational linguistics, PUNDIT (Dahl
et al., 1987) exploited similarities between nomi-
nalizations and related verbs. Hull and Gomez
(1996) describe semantic interpretation for a li-
mited set of nominalizations, relying on Word-
Net (Fellbaum, 1998) senses for restricting fillers
of semantic roles. Meyers et al. (1998) present a
procedure which maps syntactic and semantic
information for verbs into a set of patterns for
nominalizations. They use NOMLEX (MacLeod
et al., 1998), a nominalization lexicon, as the ba-
sis for this transformation. More recently, the
availability of the NomBank corpus (Meyers et
al., 2004b) has supported supervised machine
learning for nominal semantic role labeling (e.g.
Pradhan et al., 2004; Jiang and Ng, 2006; Liu
and Ng, 2007). In contrast, Padó et al. (2008) use
unsupervised machine learning for semantic role
labeling of eventive nominalizations by exploit-
ing similarities between the argument structure
of event nominalizations and corresponding
verbs. Gurevich and Waterman (2009) use a
large parsed corpus of Wikipedia to derive lexi-
cal models for determining the underlying argu-
ment structure of nominalizations.
Nominalizations have only recently garnered
attention in biomedical language processing. Ge-
neScene (Leroy and Chen, 2005) considers only
arguments of nominalizations marked by prepo-
sitional cues. Similarly, Schuman and Bergler
(2006) focus on the problem of prepositional
phrase attachment. In the BioNLP‟09 Shared
Task on Event Extraction (Kim et al., 2009), the
most frequent predicates were nominals. Several
participating systems discuss techniques that ac-
commodate nominalizations (e.g. K. B. Cohen et
al., 2009; Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2009). Nomina-
lizations have not previously been addressed in
clinically oriented text.

2.1 SemRep
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977132577777778">
SemRep (Rindflesch and Fiszman, 2003) auto-
matically extracts semantic predications (logical
subject-predicate-logical object triples) from un-
structured text (titles and abstracts) of MED-
LINE citations. It uses domain knowledge from
the Unified Medical Language System® (UMLS
®) (Bodenreider, 2004), and the interaction of
this knowledge and (underspecified) syntactic
structure supports a robust system. SemRep ex-
tracts a range of semantic predications relating to
clinical medicine (e.g. TREATS, DIAGNOSES, AD-
MINISTERED_TO, PROCESS_OF, LOCATION_OF),
substance interactions (INTERACTS_WITH, INHI-
BITS, STIMULATES), and genetic etiology of dis-
ease (ASSOCIATED_WITH, PREDISPOSES, CAUS-
ES). For example, the program identifies the fol-
lowing predications from input text MRI re-
vealed a lacunar infarction in the left internal
capsule. Arguments are concepts from the
UMLS Metathesaurus and predicates are rela-
tions from the Semantic Network.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging DIAGNOSES Infarc-
tion, Lacunar
Internal Capsule LOCATION_OF Infarction, Lacu-
nar
Processing relies on an underspecified syntac-
tic analysis based on the UMLS SPECIALIST
Lexicon (McCray et al., 1994) and the MedPost
part-of-speech tagger (Smith et al., 2004). Output
includes phrase identification, and for simple
noun phrases, labeling of heads and modifiers.

HEAD(infarction)] [in the MOD(left) MOD(internal),

MetaMap (Aronson and Lang, 2010) maps sim-
ple noun phrases to UMLS Metathesaurus con-
cepts, as shown below. Associated semantic
types are particularly important for subsequent
processing.

agnostic Procedure)}] [revealed] [a

This structure is the basis for extracting semantic
predications, which relies on several mechan-
isms. Indicator rules map syntactic phenomena,
such as verbs, nominalizations, prepositions, and
modifier-head structure in the simple noun
phrase to ontological predications. Examples in-
clude:
reveal (verb) 4 DIAGNOSES
in (prep) 4 LOCATION_OF
SemRep currently has 630 indicator rules. Onto-
logical predications are based on a modified ver-
sion of the UMLS Semantic Network and have
semantic types as arguments. For example:
Diagnostic Procedure DIAGNOSES Disease or
Syndrome
Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component LOCA-
TION_OF Disease or Syndrome
Construction of a semantic predication begins
with the application of an indicator rule, and is
then constrained by two things. Arguments must
satisfy syntactic restrictions for the indicator and
must have been mapped to Metathesaurus con-
cepts that match the arguments of the ontological
predication indicated. As part of this processing,
several syntactic phenomena are addressed, in-
cluding passivization, argument coordination,
and some types of relativization. For both verb
and preposition indicators, underspecified syn-
tactic rules simply ensure that subjects are on the
left and objects on the right. Enhancing SemRep
for nominalizations involved extending the syn-
tactic constraints for arguments of nominaliza-
tion indicators.

In order to gain insight into the principles under-
lying expression of nominal arguments, we first
determined the 50 most common nominalizations
in MEDLINE citations that also occur in the
UMLS SPECIALIST Lexicon, and then analyzed
a corpus of 1012 sentences extracted from 476
citations containing those nominalizations. We
further limited these sentences to those with no-
minalizations containing two overt arguments
(since SemRep only extracts predications with
two arguments), resulting in a final set of 383
sentences. We determined 14 alternation patterns
for nominalizations based on this analysis and
devised an algorithm to accommodate them. We
then conducted two evaluations, one to assess the
effectiveness of the algorithm independently of
other considerations and another to assess the
contribution of enhanced nominalization
processing to SemRep generally.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979941176471">
Much work in identifying arguments of nomina-
lizations assigns semantic role, such as agent,
patient, etc., but SemRep does not. In this analy-
sis, arguments are logical subject and object. Re-
lational nouns often allow only one argument
(e.g. the weight of the evidence), and either one
or both of the arguments of a nominalization or
gerund may be left unexpressed. SemRep doesn‟t
interpret nominalizations with unexpressed ar-
guments. If both arguments appear, they fall into
one of several patterns, and the challenge in no-
minalization processing is to accommodate these
patterns. Cohen et al. (2008) note several such
patterns, including those in which both argu-
ments are to the right of the nominalization, cued
by prepositions (treatment of fracture with sur-
gery), the nominalization separates the argu-
ments (fracture treatment with surgery, surgical
treatment for fracture), and both arguments pre-
cede the nominalizations, as modifiers of it (sur-
gical fracture treatment and fracture surgical
treatment).
Cohen et al. (2008) do not list several patterns
we observed in the clinical domain, including
those in which the subject appears to the right
marked by a verb (the treatment of fracture is
surgery) or as an appositive (the treatment of
fracture, surgery), and those in which the subject
appears to the left and the nominalization is ei-
ther in a prepositional phrase (surgery in the
treatment of fracture, surgery in fracture treat-
ment) or is preceded by a verb or is parenthetical
(surgery is (the best) treatment for fracture; sur-
gery is (the best) fracture treatment; surgery, the
best fracture treatment). One pattern, in which
both arguments are on the right and the subject
precedes the object, is seen most commonly in
the clinical domain when the nominalization has
a lexically specified cue (e.g. the contribution of
stem cells to kidney repair). The nominal alterna-
tion patterns are listed in Table 1.
Generalizations about arguments of nominali-
zations are based on the position of the argu-
ments, both with respect to each other and to the
nominalization, and whether they modify the
nominalization or not. A modifying argument is
internal to the simple noun phrase of which the
nominalization is the head; other arguments
(both to the left and to the right) are external.
(Relativization is considered external to the sim-
ple noun phrase.)

<bodyText confidence="0.976305939393939">
Argument cuing plays a prominent role in de-
fining these patterns. A cue is an overt syntactic
element associated with an argument, and can be
a preposition, a verb (most commonly a form of
be), a comma, or parenthesis. A cued argument is
in a dependency with the cue, which is itself in a
dependency with the nominalization. The cue
must occur between the nominalization and the
argument, whether the argument is to the right
(e.g. treatment of fracture) or to the left (e.g.
surgery in the treatment). Prepositional cues for
the objects of some nominalizations are stipu-
lated in the lexicon; some of these are obligatory
(e.g. contribution – to), while others are optional
(treatment – for).
External arguments of nominalizations must
be cued, and cues unambiguously signal the role
of the argument, according to the following
cuing rules (Cohen et al., 2008). Verbs, comma,
parenthesis, and the prepositions by, with, and
via cue subjects only. (By is used for semantic
role agent and with for instrument, but SemRep
does not exploit this distinction.) Of cues sub-
jects only if the nominalization has an obligatory
(object) cue; it must cue objects otherwise. There
is a class of nominalizations (e.g. cause) that do
not allow a prepositionally cued subject. Consi-
derable variation is seen in the order of subject
and object; however, if the subject intervenes
between the nominalization and the object, both
must have equal cuing status (the only possibili-
ties are that both be either uncued or cued with a
preposition).

3.2 Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999202558139535">
In extending SemRep for identifying arguments
of nominalizations, existing machinery was ex-
ploited, namely shallow parsing, mapping simple
noun phrases to Metathesaurus concepts, and the
application of indicator rules to map nominaliza-
tions to enhanced Semantic Network ontological
predications (which imposes restrictions on the
semantic type of arguments). Finally, syntactic
argument identification was enhanced specifical-
ly for nominalizations and exploits the linguistic
generalizations noted. For example in the sen-
tence below, phrases have been identified and
cervical cancer has been mapped to the Metathe-
saurus concept “Cervix carcinoma” with seman-
tic type „Neoplastic Process&apos;, and vaccination to
“Vaccination” („Therapeutic or Preventive Pro-
cedure&apos;). An indicator rule for prevention maps
to the ontological predication “Therapeutic or
Preventive Procedure PREVENTS Neoplastic
Process” (among others) in generating the predi-
cation: “Vaccination PREVENTS Cervix carcino-
ma.”
Therefore, prevention of cervical cancer with
HPV vaccination may have a significant fi-
nancial impact.
Processing to identify arguments for preven-
tion begins by determining whether the nomina-
lization has a lexically specified object cue. This
information is needed to determine the cuing
function of of. Since it is common for there to be
at least one argument on the right, identification
of arguments begins there. Arguments on the
right are external and must be cued. If a cued
argument is found, its role is determined by the
argument cuing rules. Since prevention does not
have a lexically specified cue, of marks its ob-
ject. Further, the semantic type of the concept for
the object of of matches the object of the onto-
logical predication („Neoplastic Process&apos;).
The algorithm next looks to the right of the
first argument for the second argument. Since
processing addresses only two arguments for
nominalizations, subject and object, once the role
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997358">
49
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.994768416666667">
of the first has been determined, the second can
be inferred. For cued arguments, the process
checks that the cue is compatible with the cuing
rules. In all cases, the relevant semantic type
must match the subject of the ontological predi-
cation. In this instance, with cues subjects and
`Therapeutic or Preventive Process‟ matches the
subject of the ontological predication indicated.
If only one noun phrase to the right satisfies
the argument cuing rules, the second argument
must be on the left. A modifier immediately to
the left of the nominalization (and thus an inter-
nal argument) is sought first, and its role inferred
from the first argument. Since internal arguments
are not cued, there is no need to ensure cuing
compatibility. The predication “Operative Sur-
gical Procedures TREATS Pregnancy, Ectopic”
is found for resolution in
Surgical resolution of an ectopic pregnancy
in a captive gerenuk (Litocranius walleri wal-
leri).
Resolution is an indicator for the ontological
predication “Therapeutic or Preventive Proce-
dure TREATS Disease or Syndrome.” Surgical
maps to “Operative Surgical Procedures” (`The-
rapeutic or Preventive Procedure‟), which
matches the subject of this predication, and ec-
topic pregnancy maps to “Pregnancy, Ectopic”
(`Disease or Syndrome‟), which matches its ob-
ject. Of marks the object of resolution.
An argument to the left of a nominalization
may be external, in which case a cue is neces-
sary. For preceding treatment satisfies this re-
quirement in the following sentence.
Preclinical data have supported the use of
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) in
combination for the treatment of indolent
lymphoid malignancies.
The two drugs in this sentence map to concepts
with semantic type `Pharmacologic Substance‟
and the malignancy has `Neoplastic Process‟, as
above. There is an ontological predication for
TREATS with subject `Pharmacologic Substance‟.
After coordination processing in SemRep, two
predications are generated for treatment:
Cyclophosphamide TREATS Malignant lymphoid
neoplasm
Fludarabine TREATS Malignant lymphoid neop-
lasm
If there is no argument to the right, both ar-
guments must be on the left. A modifier imme-
diately to the left of the nominalization is sought
first. Given the properties of cuing (the cue in-
tervenes between the argument and the nominali-
zation), if both arguments occur to the left, at
least one of them must be internal, since it is not
possible to have more than one external argu-
ment on the left (e.g. *Surgery is fracture for
treatment). The role of the first argument is
found based on semantic type. The first modifier
to the left of treatment in the following sentence
is epilepsy, which has semantic type `Disease or
Syndrome‟, matching the object of the ontologi-
cal predication for TREATS.
Patients with most chances of benefiting from
surgical epilepsy treatment
The second modifier to the left, surgical maps to
the concept “Operative Surgical Procedures,”
whose semantic type matches the subject of the
ontological predication. These conditions allow
construction of the predication “Operative Sur-
gical Procedures TREATS Epilepsy.”
In the next sentence, the indicator rule for pre-
diction maps to the ontological predication
“Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein PREDISPOSES
Disease or Syndrome.”
The potential clinical role of measuring these
apolipoproteins for ischemic stroke predic-
tion warrants further study.
Ischemic stroke satisfies the object of this predi-
cation and apolipoproteins the subject. Since the
external subject is cued by for, all constraints are
satisfied and the predication “Apolipoproteins
PREDISPOSES Ischemic stroke” is generated.

the second (eval2) assessed the effect of the en-
hancements on overall semantic interpretation in
SemRep. For eval1, we restricted SemRep to
extract predications indicated by nominalizations
only. The baseline was a nominalization argu-
ment identification rule which simply stipulates
that the subject of a predicate is a concept to the
left (starting from the modifier of the nominali-
zation, if any), and the object is a concept to the
right. This baseline implements the underspecifi-
cation principle of SemRep, without any addi-
tional logic. We compared the results from this
baseline to those from the algorithm described
above to identify arguments of nominalizations.
The gold standard for eval1 was limited to predi-
cations indicated by nominalizations.
We investigated the effect of nominalization
processing on SemRep generally in eval2, for
which the baseline implementation was SemRep
with no nominalization processing. The results
for this baseline were evaluated against those
obtained using SemRep with no restrictions.
Typical evaluation metrics, precision, recall, and

Results illustrate the importance of nominali-
zation processing for effectiveness of semantic
interpretation and show that the SemRep metho-
dology naturally extends to this phenomenon.
With a single, simple, rule (eval1 baseline), Se-
mRep achieves an F-score of 0.412. With addi-
tional processing based on linguistic generaliza-
tions, F-score improves more than 20 points.
Further, the addition of nominalization
processing not only enhances the coverage of
SemRep (more than 30 points), but also increases
precision (more than 10 points). While nominali-
zations are generally considered more difficult to
process than verbs (Cohen et al., 2008), we were
able to accommodate them with greater precision
than other types of indicators, including verbs
(0.743 vs. 0.64 in eval1 with NOM vs. eval2

quality of predications is lower, since molecular
biology text is significantly more complex than
that in the clinical domain, improvements with
nominalization processing are clearly seen.
Errors were mostly due to aspects of SemRep
orthogonal to but interacting with nominalization
processing. Complex coordination structure was
the main source of recall errors, as in the follow-
ing example.
RESULTS: The best predictors of incident
metabolic syndrome were waist circumfe-
rence (odds ratio [OR] 1.7 [1.3-2.0] per 11
cm), HDL cholesterol (0.6 [0.4-0.7] per 15
mg/dl), and proinsulin (1.7 [1.4-2.0] per 3.3
pmol/l). [PMID 14988303]
While the system was able to identify the predi-
cation “Waist circumference PREDISPOSES
Metabolic syndrome,” it was unable to find the
predications below, due to its inability to identify
the coordination of waist circumference, HDL
cholesterol, and proinsulin.

Mapping of noun phrases to the correct UMLS
concepts (MetaMap) is a source of both false
positives and false negatives, particularly in the
context of the molecular biology sentences,
where acronyms and abbreviations are common
and their disambiguation is nontrivial (Okazaki
et al., 2010). For example, in the following sen-
tence
PTK inhibition with Gen attenuated both
LPS-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding and
TNF-alpha production in human monocytes.
[PMID 10210645]
PTK was mapped to “Ephrin receptor EphA8”
rather than to “Protein Tyrosine Kinase”, causing
both a false positive and a false negative.

Some errors were due to failure to recognize a
relative clause by SemRep. Only the head of
such a structure is allowed to be an argument
outside the structure. In the sentence below, the
subject of treatment is hyperthermic intraperito-
neal intraoperative chemotherapy, which is the
head of the reduced relative clause, after cytore-
ductive surgery.
Hyperthermic intraperitoneal intraoperative
chemotherapy after cytoreductive surgery for
the treatment of abdominal sarcomatosis:

consecutive patients. [PMID 15112276]
SemRep failed to recognize the relative clause,
and therefore the nominalization algorithm took
the noun phrase inside it as the subject of treat-
ment, since it satisfies both semantic type and
argument constraints.

A small number of errors were due solely to
nominalization processing. In the following sen-
tence, the object of contribution is cued with in,
rather than lexically specified to, which causes a
recall error.

Accurate identification of the arguments of
nominalizations in the molecular biology sub-
domain is more challenging than in clinically-
oriented text. Some of the syntactic structure re-
sponsible for this complexity is discussed by K.
B. Cohen et al. (2009). In particular, they note
the problem of an argument being separated from
the nominalization, and point out the problem of
specifying the intervening structure. Although
we have not focused on molecular biology, the
analysis developed for clinical medicine shows
promise in that domain as well. One relevant ex-
tension could address the syntactic configuration
in which intervening structure involves an argu-
ment of a nominalization shared with a verb oc-
curring to the left of the nominalization, as in-
duced and activation interact in the following
sentence:
IL-2 induced less STAT1 alpha activation
and IFN-alpha induced greater STAT5 acti-
vation in NK3.3 cells compared with preacti-
vated primary NK cells. [PMID 8683106]
This could be addressed with an extension of our
rule that subjects of nominalizations can be cued
with verbs. With respect to argument identifica-
tion, induce can function like a form of be.

<bodyText confidence="0.999897694444444">
We discuss a linguistically principled implemen-
tation for identifying arguments of nominaliza-
tions in clinically focused biomedical text. The
full range of such structures is rarely addressed
by existing text mining systems, thus missing
valuable information. The algorithm is imple-
mented inside SemRep, a general semantic inter-
preter for biomedical text. We evaluated the sys-
tem both by assessing the algorithm independent-
ly and by determining the contribution it makes
to SemRep generally. The first evaluation re-
sulted in an F-score of 0.646 (P=0.743,
R=0.569), which is 20 points higher than the
baseline, while the second showed that overall
SemRep results were increased to F-score 0.689
(P=0.745, R=0.640), approximately 25 points
better than processing without nominalizations.
Since our nominalization processing is by ex-
tending SemRep, rather than by creating a dedi-
cated system, we provide the interpretation of
these structures in a broader context. An array of
semantic predications generated by mapping to
an ontology (UMLS) normalizes the interpreta-
tion of verbs and nominalizations. Processing is
linguistically based, and several syntactic phe-
nomena are addressed, including passivization,
argument coordination, and relativization. The
benefits of such processing include effective ap-
plications for extracting information on genetic
diseases from text (Masseroli et al., 2006), as
well as research in medical knowledge summari-
zation (Fiszman et al., 2004; Fiszman et al.,
2009), literature-based discovery (Ahlers et al.,
2007; Hristovski et al., 2010), and enhanced in-
formation retrieval (Kilicoglu et al., 2008; T.
Cohen et al., 2009).

Agonist is derived from agonize, but indicates an agent rather than an event. Bromocriptine, an ergot alkaloid dopamine agonist, is a recent common treatment for suppression of lactation in postpartum women. In promoting economy of expression, nominalizations are pervasive in scientific discourse, particularly the molecular biology sublanguage, due to the highly nested and complex biomolecular interactions described (Friedman et al., 2002). However, Cohen et al. (2008) point out that nominalizations are more difficult to process than verbs. Although a few systems deal with them, the focus is often limited in both the nominalizations recognized and the patterns used to express their arguments. Inability to interpret nominal constructions in a general way limits the effectiveness of such systems, since a wealth of knowledge is missed. In this paper, we discuss our recent work on interpreting nominal forms and their arguments. We concentrate on nominalizations; however, the analysis also applies to other argument-taking nouns.

They include a review of the relevant literature, and discuss a range of linguistic considerations, including morphological derivation, passivization, transitivity, and semantic topics (e.g. agent/instrument (activator) vs. action/process/state (activation)).

In this analysis, arguments are logical subject and object. Relational nouns often allow only one argument (e.g. the weight of the evidence), and either one or both of the arguments of a nominalization or gerund may be left unexpressed. SemRep doesn‟t interpret nominalizations with unexpressed arguments. If both arguments appear, they fall into one of several patterns, and the challenge in nominalization processing is to accommodate these patterns. Cohen et al. (2008) note several such patterns, including those in which both arguments are to the right of the nominalization, cued by prepositions (treatment of fracture with surgery), the nominalization separates the arguments (fracture treatment with surgery, surgical treatment for fracture), and both arguments precede the nominalizations, as modifiers of it (surgical fracture treatment and fracture surgical treatment). Cohen et al. (2008) do not list several patterns we observed in the clinical domain, including those in which the subject appears to the right marked by a verb (the treatment of fracture is s</context>

The cue must occur between the nominalization and the argument, whether the argument is to the right (e.g. treatment of fracture) or to the left (e.g. surgery in the treatment). Prepositional cues for the objects of some nominalizations are stipulated in the lexicon; some of these are obligatory (e.g. contribution – to), while others are optional (treatment – for). External arguments of nominalizations must be cued, and cues unambiguously signal the role of the argument, according to the following cuing rules (Cohen et al., 2008). Verbs, comma, parenthesis, and the prepositions by, with, and via cue subjects only. (By is used for semantic role agent and with for instrument, but SemRep does not exploit this distinction.) Of cues subjects only if the nominalization has an obligatory (object) cue; it must cue objects otherwise. There is a class of nominalizations (e.g. cause) that do not allow a prepositionally cued subject. Considerable variation is seen in the order of subject and object; however, if the subject intervenes between the nominalization and the object, both must have equal cuing status (the only possibilit</context>

With a single, simple, rule (eval1 baseline), SemRep achieves an F-score of 0.412. With additional processing based on linguistic generalizations, F-score improves more than 20 points. Further, the addition of nominalization processing not only enhances the coverage of SemRep (more than 30 points), but also increases precision (more than 10 points). While nominalizations are generally considered more difficult to process than verbs (Cohen et al., 2008), we were able to accommodate them with greater precision than other types of indicators, including verbs (0.743 vs. 0.64 in eval1 with NOM vs. eval2 baseline) with our patterns.

Agonist is derived from agonize, but indicates an agent rather than an event. Bromocriptine, an ergot alkaloid dopamine agonist, is a recent common treatment for suppression of lactation in postpartum women. In promoting economy of expression, nominalizations are pervasive in scientific discourse, particularly the molecular biology sublanguage, due to the highly nested and complex biomolecular interactions described (Friedman et al., 2002). However, Cohen et al. (2008) point out that nominalizations are more difficult to process than verbs. Although a few systems deal with them, the focus is often limited in both the nominalizations recognized and the patterns used to express their arguments. Inability to interpret nominal constructions in a general way limits the effectiveness of such systems, since a wealth of knowledge is missed. In this paper, we discuss our recent work on interpreting nominal forms and their arguments. We concentrate on nominalizations; however, the analysis also applies to other argument-taking nouns.

The second evaluation showed that overall SemRep results were increased to F-score 0.689 (P=0.745, R=0.640), approximately 25 points better than processing without nominalizations. 1 Introduction Extracting semantic relations from text and representing them as predicate-argument structures is increasingly seen as foundational for mining the biomedical literature (Kim et al., 2008). Most research has focused on relations indicated by verbs (Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004; Kogan et al., 2005). However nominalizations, gerunds, and relational nouns also take arguments. For example, the following sentence has three nominalizations, treatment, suppression, and lactation (nominalized forms of the verbs treat, suppress, and lactate, respectively).

Since the external subject is cued by for, all constraints are satisfied and the predication “Apolipoproteins PREDISPOSES Ischemic stroke” is generated. 3.3 Evaluation Three-hundred sentences from 239 MEDLINE citations (titles and abstracts) were selected for annotating a test set. Some had previously been selected for various aspects of SemRep evaluation; others were chosen randomly. A small number (30) were sentences in the GENIA event corpus (Kim et al., 2008) with bio-eventtriggering nominalizations. Annotation was conducted by three of the authors. One, a linguist (A), judged all sentences, while the other two, a computer scientist (B) and a medical informatics researcher (C), annotated a subset. Annotation was not limited to nominalizations. The statistics regarding the individual annotations are given below.

Hull and Gomez (1996) describe semantic interpretation for a limited set of nominalizations, relying on WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) senses for restricting fillers of semantic roles. Meyers et al. (1998) present a procedure which maps syntactic and semantic information for verbs into a set of patterns for nominalizations. They use NOMLEX (MacLeod et al., 1998), a nominalization lexicon, as the basis for this transformation. More recently, the availability of the NomBank corpus (Meyers et al., 2004b) has supported supervised machine learning for nominal semantic role labeling (e.g. Pradhan et al., 2004; Jiang and Ng, 2006; Liu and Ng, 2007).

We evaluated the enhancements in two ways: by examining the ability to identify arguments of nominals independently and the effect these enhancements had on the overall quality of SemRep output. 2 Background The theoretical linguistics literature has addressed the syntax of nominalizations (e.g. Chomsky, 1970; Grimshaw, 1990; Grimshaw and Williams, 1993), however, largely as support for theoretical argumentation, rather than detailed description of the facts. Quirk et al.

Within the context of NomBank, a project dedicated to annotation of argument structure, Meyers et al. (2004a) describe the linguistics of nominalizations, emphasizing semantic roles. However, major syntactic patterns of argument realization are also noted. Cohen et al. (2008) provide a comprehensive overview of nominalizations in biomedical</context>

The second evaluation showed that overall SemRep results were increased to F-score 0.689 (P=0.745, R=0.640), approximately 25 points better than processing without nominalizations. 1 Introduction Extracting semantic relations from text and representing them as predicate-argument structures is increasingly seen as foundational for mining the biomedical literature (Kim et al., 2008). Most research has focused on relations indicated by verbs (Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004; Kogan et al., 2005). However nominalizations, gerunds, and relational nouns also take arguments. For example, the following sentence has three nominalizations, treatment, suppression, and lactation (nominalized forms of the verbs treat, suppress, and lactate, respectively). Agonist is derived from agonize, but indicates an agent rather than an event. Bromocriptine, an ergot alkaloid dopamine agonist, is a recent common treatment for suppression of lactation in postpartum women. In promoting economy of expression, nominalizations are pervasive in scientific discourse, particularly the molecul</context>
