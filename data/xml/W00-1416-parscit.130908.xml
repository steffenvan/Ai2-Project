<bodyText confidence="0.9999772">
A range of research has explored the problem of
generating referring expressions that uniquely iden-
tify a single entity from the shared context. But
what about expressions that identify sets of enti-
ties? In this paper, I adapt recent semantic re-
search on plural descriptions—using covers to ab-
stract collective and distributive readings and us-
ing sets of assignments to represent dependencies
among references—to describe a search problem for
set-identifying expressions that largely mirrors the
search problem for singular referring expressions.
By structuring the search space only in terms of
the words that can be added to the description, the
proposal defuses potential combinatorial explosions
that might otherwise arise with reference to sets.

<bodyText confidence="0.998934444444445">
Natural language interaction lends itself to tasks like
generalization, abstraction, comparison, and sum-
marization which call for SETS of objects to be
picked out using definite referring expressions.
For example, consider the concrete function of
describing the elements of a figure. In (Ib), we find
a pair of elements from (I a); imagine that some no-
table relationship leads to an intention to identify
and comment on just THOSE elements.

As (1 c) records, these are the intersecting dotted
segments of (la), and can be designated as such.
Or again, we find distinguished in (2b) five ele-
ments of (2a), which might hold some independent
interest. So we can and should identify these ele-
ments, and (2c), the squares clustered at the lower
left, will do the trick.
c The squares clustered at the lower left.
Concrete problems like those of ( 1 ) and (2) cast
into relief the potential difficulty of identifying sets.
The world provides sets with embarrassing abun-
dance, yet we are able to call attention to any of these
sets at will, and to describe it at will both by prop-
erties its members have on. their own—the mem-
bers individually may be square or dotted and .by
properties or relationships that the set enjoys as a
collection—the set as a whole may be intersecting,
or clustered in a certain region.
Reference to sets is more general than picturesque
examples like (1) and (2) might suggest. Linguistic
research suggests that covert reference to SETS OF
SALIENT ALTERNATIVES plays a pervasive and fun-
damental role in mediating between the meanings of
sentences, and their interpretations in context. Con-

According to (Rooth, 1992), the interpretation of fo-
cusing adverbs such as-onlyTelates an-instance a-to
a set of alternatives C: the adverb describes a prop-
erty that makes a unique in C. Thus in (3a) Mary is
unique among some set C of individuals in passing.
Likewise, scalar implicature, as illustrated in (3b),
depends on distinguishing one claim—my passing,
say—as the strongest claim that can be supported
among some salient set of claims C—students in the
class passing, for (3b). Rooth formalizes the focus
marking in these examples as contributing a presup-
position that helps to identify these alternative sets.
More generally, a range of lexical items, including
the morpheme other from (3c), carry discourse pre-
suppositions that relate their referent to salient al-
ternatives from the context—like the students we
accommodate in understanding (3c) (Bierner and
Webber, 2000).
Overtly, all the examples in (3) involve singu-
lar noun phrases that specify isolated individuals.
Nevertheless, representing and reasoning about ref-
erence to sets is required for faithful account of how
such sentences are interpreted, and thus how such
sentences can achieve the communicative goals of a
system for natural language generation (NLG).
So how are expressions that refer to sets to be con-
structed? In this paper, I will argue that identifying
sets of individuals is not as forbidding as it may at
first appear. The extensive literature in NLG on sin-
gular references starting with (Dale and Haddock,
1991) tells us what to do. We must use the INTER-
PRETATION of provisional descriptions in context
to assemble a combination of descriptive elements
which identifies the intended target. Take (2), where
we used the descriptive elements square, clustered
somewhere, and at the lower :left.. &apos;Tracking the in-
cremental interpretation of these descriptors should
lead to a sequence like that in (4).
d The squares clustered somewhere.
The squares clustered at the lower left.
This high-level story leaves us on familiar ground.
The project of this paper is to realize this high-
level story in formal terms. I begin in Section 2 by
framing the problem of singular noun phrase gener-
ation more precisely. The sequel extends this frame-
work with a formal account of plural interpreta-
tion and generation. Section 3 introduces the two
independently-motivated observations from formal
semantics which form the basis of this account.

• The ASSIGNMENT-SET semantics for reference
to plurals provides a way to evoke and describe
collections with variables that range only over
individuals (van den Berg, 1993; van den Berg,
1996). By using the assignment-set semantics,
we can dispense with explicit collections in for-
malizing an interpretation such as that schema-
tized in (4c); we represent only the individuals
involved.

O The COVER semantics for predications about
pluralities provides a simple scheme of im-
plicit quantification to abstract collective and

the models used to generate-singular references. In

cording to a greedy heuristic, while (Dale and Re-
iter, 1995) select alternatives by exploring differ-
ent kinds of constraints in a fixed order. In any
case, the search starts with a structure defining an
empty description, which means nothing and could
refer to anything. Structures are then extended and
considered in turn until the interpretation satisfies
the system&apos;s goals (for example because it allows
only a specified value, the intended referent, for a
particular variable). The process of extension sim-
ply consists of deriving a more elaborate form with
a richer meaning using the generator&apos;s linguistic
resources it is useful to think of obtaining this by
carrying out a step of derivation in a lexicalized
grammar (Stone and Doran, I997)—and then con-
sulting the model of the context to obtain an updated
interpretation.
To extend these data structures to sets, we cannot
introduce set variables and maintain the alternative
candidate set values those variables might ultimately
refer to—for one thine, there are just too many sets
to represent an interpretation this way.
3 An intuition and some semantics
Here. is a sue-Ees-tion: REINTERPRET..data.struclures
like (5) as compatible with descriptions of collec-
tions as well as singletons. This should have sonic
intuitive appeal. After all, we always thought that
a form like (5a) abstracted out details of syntax and
morphology; there&apos;s no difficulty then in seeing it
as short for a family of singular and plural expres-
sions like /the square(s)in the upper 101. Similarly,
the interpretation is already defined in terms of a set
of instances that satisfy the description; why not use
this as THE set that the description refers to?
The problem is the meaning. We have to allow

C
(5a) proposes the form the square in the upper left—
a syntactic structure represented to some degree of
abstraction. (5b) records the semantics for the de-
scription as a set of constraints—each constraint is
an atomic formula with free variables that speci-
fies the requirement that some lexical meaning con-
tributes to the description; the variables are place-
holders for the discourse entities that the descrip-
tion identifies. And (Sc) anticipates how the hearer
could process the description, by outlining the pos-
sible candidate referents for it; in (Sc) we find the
element of the figure which x must represent, along
with the corresponding (vaguely delimited) region r
in the upper left where x is located.
Any data structure linking form, meaning and
interpretation combines two kinds of information.
Form and meaning are related by the generator&apos;s
model of linguistic resources. In the concrete case,
this model is a grammar; LEXICAL semantics de-
termines the separate constraints that can go into a
description and COMPOSITIONAL semantics deter-
mines how these constraints can share variables and
so describe common objects. Meaning and interpre-
tation, meanwhile, are related by a model of the con-
text in which the form is lobe uttered. In interpreting
referring expressions,.we appeal to a CONTEXT SET
enumerating the salient individuals at some point in
the discourse and a COMMON GROUND listing the

for both DISTRIBUTIVE predicates, which character-
ize collections based on properties of the individuals
involved, and COLLECTIVE predicates, which de-
scribe collections that jointly participate in some re-
lation. If we have collective predicates, how can we
get away without explicit set variables which could
take on any set as a possible value?
Van den Berg&apos;s treatment of dependent plurals in
dynamic semantics provides the first half of the an-
swer (van den Berg, 1993; van den Berg, 1996). Van
den Berg&apos;s starting observation is that discourse can
set up and maintain dependencies between the indi-
viduals in one set and the individuals in another.

(6) a Every man loves a woman.
b They prove this by giving them flowers.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916384615385">
In (6) for example, the first sentence introduces a set
of men and a set of women, where each man in the
one set is related to a woman in the other set (by
love); the second sentence builds on that relation-
ship, indicating another connection (of giving) be-
tween each man and the corresponding woman.
For van den Berg, data like (6) show that dis-
courses describe sets of CASES generally. Each case
involves a sequence of entities that stand in vari-
ous relationships to one another, sometimes directly
as individuals and sometimes indirectly through
their membership in larger, related groups. Some
sentences in discourse aggregate cases together, to
express relationships that hold collectively among
groups. Other sentences, like (6), zoom in on in-
dividual cases, and describe distributive properties
which hold of isolated individuals. In zooming in on
cases, rather than individuals, these sentences main-
tain and extend the dependencies and other relation-
ships that define a case.
The second half of the answer derives from
the observation, made in (Gillon, 1987; Verkuyl
and van der Does, 1991; Schwarzschild, 1994;
Schwarzschild; -I99.6); :that .the .collective-and dis-
tributive readings of plurals represent only the ex-
tremes in a larger space of readings. Take (7):

<listItem confidence="0.968382">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999711459459459">
This sentence is true, but only in virtue of the joint
action of Rogers and Hammerstein in writing some
musicals and the-joint acaion-ofRoeers and Hart in -
writing other musicals. As a matter of fact, the three
never wrote a musical individually or as a single
team, so both the collective and distributive readings
are false.
We will follow Schwarzschild&apos;s proposal most
closely. Schwarzschild argues that we establish that
a linguistic predicate applies to a plural argument
by recavering a salient cover of :that argument, from
the context. A cover here means a set of plurali-
ties whose union or sum is the overall plural argu-
ment. Given the cover, the overall plural predication
holds just in case the basic property denoted by the
predicate is true (collectively) of each of the sets (or
CELLS) in the cover. For example, the sets consist-
ing of Rogers and Hammerstein and of Rogers and
Hart form the salient cover of Roger, Hammerstein
and Hart in (7); the example is true because each of
the cells in this cover directly enjoys the property of
having written a musical.
Schwarzschild&apos;s covering proposal and van den
Berg&apos;s assignment-set proposal are perfectly com-
patible. Following van den Berg, we interpret dis-
courses in terms of sets of cases, where these cases
spell out dependencies among related individuals.
But now, following Schwarzschild, we zoom in on
those cases flexibly, by covering them. Sometimes
we consider all the cases together and describe rela-
tionships among aggregated groups; sometimes we
consider cases separately and describe individuals
distributively; and sometimes, as in (7), we take an
intermediate step and cluster the eases into some
salient subgroups.
Now let us return to (4c), repeated as (8a), and
consider informally what this proposal amounts to:

The assignment-set cover semantics fits the descrip-
tion to the figure this way. As in (5c), the figure
schematizes a set of cases; here each case involves
two entities, a square and the location of the cluster
to which the square belongs. The description applies
because we can look at the individual cases to see
that we have squares, and we can group the cases to-
gether by region into a cover so that in-each cell the
squares are indeed clustered at the location.
At this point, some formalism is required to pro-

ceed with the development. We&apos;ll use assignment
variables like g to range over cases; gx is the value
of g for variable x.1 Interpretations are defined in
terms of sets of cases, naturally; we&apos;ll user to range
over a set of cases and write F(x)- for {gx g E F}.
Most constraints will involve several variables; we
can abstract this in terms of a Sequence Of VaiiableSX
and the tuple of collections that those variables take
on across a set of cases, F(x). (We can define this
explicitly as F(x) = G where GA-1 = r(xi)-)
Now, consider an atomic constraint F(x). In gen-
eral, F(x) will have multiple known instances, and
each instance will relate collections of individuals
to one another. Thus the common ground will asso-
ciate F(x) with a set of tuples of sets, which we write
as ElF(x)]. An interpretation F will fit one of those
instances directly if F(x) C IF(x)j. In this case we
say F(x) DESCRIBES F.
For example, consider the constraint
clustered(x,r). Let us say a set X is clustered
around R if R is a singleton spatial location fr-1- and
X is a group of sufficient cardinality and density
located together at r. Then we might find three
tuples of aclustered(x,r)fi in the explicit depiction
of (8). If we define r1 as in (9) then clustered(x,r)
describes r1.

Of course, we are principally interested in the
ability to zoom in to particular cases, using covers.
We represent a cover using a reflexive binary rela-
tion that links each assignment to any assignment
in its cell. Given such a relation C, the constraint
Cpc p—read &amp;quot;covered by C, p&amp;quot;—says that p is true
on each of the cells of the cover specified by C. We
will only consider the case where p is an atomic con-

Observe the close connection between this formal
judgment and -the-informal -discussiorrof (8) pre-
sented earlier. We have a set of cases involving a
square and the location of the cluster to which the
square belongs; we cover the cases together by re-
gion and find that the resulting groups define a spec-
ified cluster at a specified location.
Schwarzschild&apos;s proposal is that the salient cover
C is supplied from context. In the case of definite
reference to tuples F, we can regard the tuples in any
predicate as defining the appropriate salient cover
for plural predication; any tuples that help to iden-
tify r must be prominent parts of the shared context.
Meanings of referring expressions should therefore
appeal to a condition C) p which describes r if there
is a C for which C)c p describes F.
Clearly, if ©p describes F and ©p describes I&apos;
then ©p describes F u r. This in turn entails that
any condition C)p describes a maximal set of cases
from the current context; the same goes for any con-
junction of conditions of this form. We can treat
this set of cases as the interpretation of a description.
In particular, consider a description L that consists
of a list of constraints ©L1 (x) formulated in terms
of a tuple of variables x and atomic conditions on
those variables Li(x). Assume a context set D defin-
ing a domain of salient individuals, so that candidate
cases to interpret L are given by r la a, E
The development thus far leads us to define the IN-
TERPRETATION of L--/(L)—as:

<bodyText confidence="0.994219571428571">
Drawing on our running discussion, we
can apply this definition to the description
L = {Osq.uare(x),(Dclustered(x,r)} and the
context schematized by (2a). Of course, we find
/(L) = r, u r, 1...1 F3. The fully distributive cover
shows that the square condition is satisfied; the
cover of (12) shows that the clustered condition
is satisfied. Meanwhile, no further cases can be
considered without adding either a circle or the
unclustered square.

4.1 Collective Constraints

<bodyText confidence="0.990662041666667">
The first step is to formulate a constraint-satisfaction
heuristic that accounts for cover-constraints on col-
lections. In general, constraint-satisfaction heuris-
tics provide a technique for approximating the inter-
pretation of a description. The key notion is that of a
CONSTRAINT NETWORK for a description L, which
determines a tuple C of CONSTRAINED VALUES.
This tuple specifies a generous set of possible val-
ues Ci for each variable xi in x; it is obtained by con-
servatively eliminating values that are determined to
be inconsistent with L according to heuristic tests.
For example, the usual arc-consistency heuristic for
a constraint over individuals K(x) is to eliminate a
value r for variable z unless some g C [K(x)]j has
v and gk E Ci, for all k.
We will adapt this to the case of cover constraints
with the following test of consistency. An individ-
ual value 1, for a variable xi maintains its member-
ship in C, in the.presence,of.a collective.eonstraint
©L1(x) whenever v belongs to a SUBSET Gi of Ci
which participates directly in the relation denoted by
(x) with sets of possible values for the other vari-
ables. This criterion is spelled out formally in the
definition in (15).

with constraint CI Li(x) undereonstrained
values C if there is an G E [[L(x)]] with
E Gi and Gk C Ck for all k.
All values of xi in Ci that are not c-consistent
with constraint ©L( x) may be deleted from Ci,
as they will not satisfy the constraint. Doing so
makes Ci ARC c-consistent with respect to C)Li(x),
and provides the basic step in a network-based arc-
consistency constraint-satisfier. As with ordinary
constraint satisfaction, we arrive at a final tuple of
values for x by starting with an initial tuple Co of
values—often an assignment Dx giving each vari-
able D and a queue of arcs linking each C, with any
(DL)(x) that constrains it. Until the queue is empty,
we select an arc and enforce the arc c-consistency
by pruning Ci; if Ci changes we requeue all arcs
that might no longer be arc e-consistent after the
deletion. I will refer to the final tuple of values as
P(L; C0), for the PLURAL constraint network on de-
scription L and domains Co.
The properties of this algorithm are in line with
ordinary constraint satisfaction. The output will
not provide all and only solutions to the constraints
without further assumptions about the constraints.
However, we can show, as usual, that the network
converges on consistent values for variables in the
ordinary linguistic case where the constraint graph
is a tree—a semantic property, that there are no dis-
joint sets of constraints that overlap on the same
two variables, that follows under plausible assump-
tions about the derivation of semantics from a tree-
structured syntax. We can show further that these
values, together with the triples in [I.Li(x)] that cover
these values, determine precisely the collection of
assignments /(L).

The second step is to formalize the task of construct-
ing a description as a state-space search task. Sup-

a tuple E as set out in (16).
(16) E = (L,r,R.x,P(L;R,Dx),P(L;Dr,Dx)

specific intended values;

which we intend for the corresponding
variable ri; - • -

describing the values for all the free
variables in the description, on the
assumption that the distinguished variables
may, like other variables, take on any values
from the context set.
The distinction between the variables whose in-
tended reference is fixed and those for which it is de-
rived as a byproduct of the search process is due to
Horacek (Horacek, 1995; Horacek, 1996); the dis-
tinction derives increased importance when relating
one collection to another as the choice of collections
need not give rise to explicit branching in search.
The initial state involves an empty description and
so has the form given in (18).
(18) E KO, r, R, (),P(0; , P( 0; Dr))
A state such as (16) represents a final state that suc-
cessfully resolves the generation task when each
variable x from r and x is associated with the same
set CI, in both P(L;R,Dx) and P(L; Dr, Dx). This
simply means that the hearer&apos;s interpretation of the
referring expression matches the speaker&apos;s intended
interpretation.

Descriptions of sets obviously have much in com-
mon with expressions that describe a single entity
from the shared context. In particular, adopting the
standard view of NLG as goal-directed activity (Ap-
pelt, 1985; Dale, 1992; Moore, 1994; Moore and
Paris, 1993), singular and plural descriptions agree
both in the kinds of intentions that they can achieve
and the stages of generation at which they can be for-
mulated. We cannot expect a single process to be re-
sponsible for set descriptions across all intentions or
stages of NLG.
For example, as with a singular description, a
description of a set may appeal to properties that
play a role in the argument the speaker is trying to
make, and may therefore address goals above and
beyond simple identification of discourse entities.
(See (Donellan, .1966; ICronfeld, 1986) on the dis-
tinction.) (Green et al., 1998a; Green et al., 1998b)
show how such descriptions may be represented and
formulated in NLG at a high-level process of con-
tent or rhetorical planning. At the same time, plu-
rals and singulars are alike in offering resources for
reference—such as pronouns, one-anaphora or ag-
gregated expressions—that bypass explicit descrip-
tion altogether. The use of these resources may be
quite.-closely dependent on the surface forth being
generated and so could reflect a relatively late deci-
sion in the generation process (Dale and Haddock,

sively, it is no surprise that the search space for plu-

mately defined by the sequences of elements that
make up descriptions. NLG involves search to use

<abstract confidence="0.989965562841531">A range of research has explored the problem of generating referring expressions that uniquely identify a single entity from the shared context. But what about expressions that identify sets of entities? In this paper, I adapt recent semantic research on plural descriptions—using covers to abstract collective and distributive readings and using sets of assignments to represent dependencies among references—to describe a search problem for set-identifying expressions that largely mirrors the search problem for singular referring expressions. By structuring the search space only in terms of the words that can be added to the description, the proposal defuses potential combinatorial explosions that might otherwise arise with reference to sets. Natural language interaction lends itself to tasks like generalization, abstraction, comparison, and sumwhich call for objects to be picked out using definite referring expressions. For example, consider the concrete function of describing the elements of a figure. In (Ib), we find a pair of elements from (I a); imagine that some notable relationship leads to an intention to identify comment on just (1) a c The intersecting dotted segments. (1 c) records, these are intersecting dotted (la), and can be designated as such. Or again, we find distinguished in (2b) five elements of (2a), which might hold some independent interest. So we can and should identify these eleand (2c), squares clustered at the lower do the trick. c The squares clustered at the lower left. Concrete problems like those of ( 1 ) and (2) cast into relief the potential difficulty of identifying sets. The world provides sets with embarrassing abundance, yet we are able to call attention to any of these sets at will, and to describe it at will both by propits members have on. their own—the memindividually may be properties or relationships that the set enjoys as a set as a whole may be a certain region. Reference to sets is more general than picturesque examples like (1) and (2) might suggest. Linguistic suggests that covert reference to OF ALTERNATIVES a pervasive and fundamental role in mediating between the meanings of sentences, and their interpretations in context. Con- (2) a 116 (3) a Only [Mary]F passed. b Well, [1]F. passed. c Another student passed. According to (Rooth, 1992), the interpretation of foadverbs a-to set of alternatives adverb describes a propthat makes a unique in in (3a) Mary is among some set individuals in passing. Likewise, scalar implicature, as illustrated in (3b), depends on distinguishing one claim—my passing, say—as the strongest claim that can be supported among some salient set of claims C—students in the class passing, for (3b). Rooth formalizes the focus marking in these examples as contributing a presupposition that helps to identify these alternative sets. More generally, a range of lexical items, including morpheme (3c), carry discourse presuppositions that relate their referent to salient alternatives from the context—like the students we accommodate in understanding (3c) (Bierner and Webber, 2000). Overtly, all the examples in (3) involve singular noun phrases that specify isolated individuals. Nevertheless, representing and reasoning about reference to sets is required for faithful account of how such sentences are interpreted, and thus how such sentences can achieve the communicative goals of a system for natural language generation (NLG). So how are expressions that refer to sets to be constructed? In this paper, I will argue that identifying sets of individuals is not as forbidding as it may at first appear. The extensive literature in NLG on singular references starting with (Dale and Haddock, tells us what to do. We must use the INTERprovisional descriptions in context to assemble a combination of descriptive elements which identifies the intended target. Take (2), where used the descriptive elements clustered the lower :left.. the incremental interpretation of these descriptors should lead to a sequence like that in (4). squares clustered somewhere. The squares clustered at the lower left. This high-level story leaves us on familiar ground. The project of this paper is to realize this highlevel story in formal terms. I begin in Section 2 by framing the problem of singular noun phrase generation more precisely. The sequel extends this framework with a formal account of plural interpretation and generation. Section 3 introduces the two independently-motivated observations from formal semantics which form the basis of this account. The for reference to plurals provides a way to evoke and describe collections with variables that range only over individuals (van den Berg, 1993; van den Berg, 1996). By using the assignment-set semantics, we can dispense with explicit collections in formalizing an interpretation such as that schematized in (4c); we represent only the individuals involved. The for predications about pluralities provides a simple scheme of implicit quantification to abstract collective and distributive predication (Gillon, 1987; Verkuyl and van der Does, 1991; Schwarzschild, 1994; Sehwarzschild, 1996)..The cover semantics offers an elegant, and convenient, definition of what it means for the set distinguished in (4c) to characterized as squares clustered somewhere. 4 presents the computational model plural descriptions based on these principles. In keeping with (4), this model simply and naturally extends the models used to generate-singular references. In particular, as (4) suggests, this model continues to structure the search space for generation in terms of flu o LI (4) a b The squares. 7 LI E 117 the words that can be added to the description and to arrive at corresponding interpretations by constraint satisfaction over individuals.

To determine the in- 2 Background terpretation from the meaning, we must instantiate a level, we can characterize generation pro-cedures like that of (Dale and Haddock, 1991) or its successors as manipulating linguistic data structures link together MEANINGS INTERillustrates such a data structure, as it might be entertained in identifying a uniquely element of the free variables to individuals in the context set match the instantiated constraints against the ela in the upper left/ tv1: • ements-iof the, commorLground. .In practice, _con-straint satisfaction heuristics (Mackworth, 1987) are required to accomplish the process of instantiation and matching with any hope of efficiency. With an understanding of what data structures such as (5) represent and how to carry out reasoning over them, solving descriptive problems becomes a matter of search. In practice, this search is typi-cally managed quite simply: for example, (Dale and Haddock, 1991) select transitions among states ac-cording to a greedy heuristic, while (Dale and Re-iter, 1995) select alternatives by exploring differ-ent kinds of constraints in a fixed order. In any case, the search starts with a structure defining an empty description, which means nothing and could refer to anything. Structures are then extended and considered in turn until the interpretation satisfies the system&apos;s goals (for example because it allows a specified value, the intended referent, a particular variable). The process of extension simof deriving a more elaborate form with a richer meaning using the generator&apos;s linguistic resources it is useful to think of obtaining this a step of derivation in a lexicalized grammar (Stone and Doran, I997)—and then consulting the model of the context to obtain an updated interpretation. To extend these data structures to sets, we cannot introduce set variables and maintain the alternative candidate set values those variables might ultimately refer to—for one thine, there are just too many sets to represent an interpretation this way. 3 An intuition and some semantics is a like (5) as compatible with descriptions of collec-tions as well as singletons. This should have sonic intuitive appeal. After all, we always thought that form like abstracted details of syntax and morphology; there&apos;s no difficulty then in seeing it as short for a family of singular and plural expreslike square(s)in the upper 101. the interpretation is already defined in terms of a set instances that satisfy the description; why use as set the description refers to? problem is the We to allow 0 C proposes the form square in the upper left—a syntactic structure represented to some degree of abstraction. (5b) records the semantics for the de-scription as a set of constraints—each constraint is an atomic formula with free variables that speci-fies the requirement that some lexical meaning con-tributes to the description; the variables are place-holders for the discourse entities that the descrip-tion identifies. And (Sc) anticipates how the hearer process the description, by outlining pos-sible candidate referents for it; in (Sc) we find the element of the figure which x must represent, along with the corresponding (vaguely delimited) region r in the upper left where x is located. Any data structure linking form, meaning and interpretation combines two kinds of information. Form and meaning are related by the generator&apos;s model of linguistic resources. In the concrete case, model is a grammar; de-termines the separate constraints that can go into a and deter-mines how these constraints can share variables and so describe common objects. Meaning and interpre-tation, meanwhile, are related by a model of the con-text in which the form is lobe uttered. In interpreting appeal to a SET enumerating the salient individuals at some point in discourse and a GROUND the 118 both which characterize collections based on properties of the individuals and which describe collections that jointly participate in some relation. If we have collective predicates, how can we get away without explicit set variables which could take on any set as a possible value? Van den Berg&apos;s treatment of dependent plurals in dynamic semantics provides the first half of the answer (van den Berg, 1993; van den Berg, 1996). Van den Berg&apos;s starting observation is that discourse can set up and maintain dependencies between the individuals in one set and the individuals in another. (6) a Every man loves a woman. b They prove this by giving them flowers. In (6) for example, the first sentence introduces a set of men and a set of women, where each man in the one set is related to a woman in the other set (by love); the second sentence builds on that relationship, indicating another connection (of giving) between each man and the corresponding woman. For van den Berg, data like (6) show that disdescribe sets of Each case involves a sequence of entities that stand in various relationships to one another, sometimes directly as individuals and sometimes indirectly through their membership in larger, related groups. Some sentences in discourse aggregate cases together, to express relationships that hold collectively among groups. Other sentences, like (6), zoom in on inand describe distributive properties which hold of isolated individuals. In zooming in on cases, rather than individuals, these sentences maintain and extend the dependencies and other relationships that define a case. The second half of the answer derives from observation, made in (Gillon, 1987; van Does, 1991; Schwarzschild, 1994; :that .the .collective-and distributive readings of plurals represent only the exin a larger Take (7): (7) Rogers, Hammerstein and Hart wrote musicals. This sentence is true, but only in virtue of the joint action of Rogers and Hammerstein in writing some musicals and the-joint acaion-ofRoeers and Hart in musicals. As a matter of fact, the three never wrote a musical individually or as a single team, so both the collective and distributive readings We will follow Schwarzschild&apos;s proposal most closely. Schwarzschild argues that we establish that a linguistic predicate applies to a plural argument recavering a salient cover of :that from the context. A cover here means a set of pluralities whose union or sum is the overall plural argument. Given the cover, the overall plural predication just case the basic property denoted by the predicate is true (collectively) of each of the sets (or the cover. For example, the sets consisting of Rogers and Hammerstein and of Rogers and Hart form the salient cover of Roger, Hammerstein and Hart in (7); the example is true because each of the cells in this cover directly enjoys the property of having written a musical. Schwarzschild&apos;s covering proposal and van den Berg&apos;s assignment-set proposal are perfectly compatible. Following van den Berg, we interpret discourses in terms of sets of cases, where these cases spell out dependencies among related individuals. But now, following Schwarzschild, we zoom in on those cases flexibly, by covering them. Sometimes we consider all the cases together and describe relationships among aggregated groups; sometimes we consider cases separately and describe individuals distributively; and sometimes, as in (7), we take an step and cluster the eases into salient subgroups. let us return (4c), repeated as (8a), and consider informally what this proposal amounts to: (8) a assignment-set semantics the descripto the figure this way. As in figure schematizes a set of cases; here each case involves two entities, a square and the location of the cluster to which the square belongs. The description applies because we can look at the individual cases to see we have we can group the together by region into a cover so that in-each cell the are indeed location. this point, some formalism is required to pro- El o The squares clustered somewhere. 119 ceed with the development. We&apos;ll use assignment like g to range over cases; is the value g for variable Interpretations are defined in terms of sets of cases, naturally; we&apos;ll user to range a set of cases and write for g E F}. Most constraints will involve several variables; we can abstract this in terms of a Sequence Of VaiiableSX and the tuple of collections that those variables take on across a set of cases, F(x). (We can define this as F(x) = G where = Now, consider an atomic constraint F(x). In general, F(x) will have multiple known instances, and each instance will relate collections of individuals to one another. Thus the common ground will associate F(x) with a set of tuples of sets, which we write as ElF(x)]. An interpretation F will fit one of those instances directly if F(x) C IF(x)j. In this case we say F(x) DESCRIBES F. For example, consider the constraint Let say a set clustered a singleton spatial location and a group of sufficient cardinality and density together at we might find three of the explicit depiction (8). If we define as in (9) then (x, : x square in the lower left region r} Of course, we are principally interested in the ability to zoom in to particular cases, using covers. We represent a cover using a reflexive binary relation that links each assignment to any assignment its cell. Given such a relation constraint p—read &amp;quot;covered by p&amp;quot;—says true each of the cells of the cover specified by only consider the case where an atomic con- (10) DESCRIBES if for all g E F, describes {h from (11 a) and (11b) respectively.

C ) Li (F2 x U (r3 F3). Observe the close connection between this formal and (8) presented earlier. We have a set of cases involving a square and the location of the cluster to which the square belongs; we cover the cases together by region and find that the resulting groups define a specified cluster at a specified location. Schwarzschild&apos;s proposal is that the salient cover supplied from context. In the case of definite reference to tuples F, we can regard the tuples in any predicate as defining the appropriate salient cover for plural predication; any tuples that help to idenbe prominent parts of the shared context. Meanings of referring expressions should therefore to a condition C) describes r if there a which p F. if F and ©p describes I&apos; describes F u r. This in turn entails that any condition C)p describes a maximal set of cases from the current context; the same goes for any conjunction of conditions of this form. We can treat this set of cases as the interpretation of a description. In particular, consider a description L that consists a list of constraints (x) formulated in terms of a tuple of variables x and atomic conditions on variables Assume a context set defining a domain of salient individuals, so that candidate to interpret L are given by la The development thus far leads us to define the IN- TERPRETATION of L--/(L)—as: /(L) := : ©L(x) describes Drawing on our running discussion, we can apply this definition to the description = the context schematized by (2a). Of course, we find = u r, F3. fully distributive cover that the is satisfied; the of (12) shows that the is satisfied. Meanwhile, no further cases can be considered without adding either a circle or the unclustered square. The reader will already have recognized 1(1L) set of eases-that-goes-with (8a). Thus, we have reconciled the informal picture of (4) with the concrete data structures of form, meaning 120 and interpretation that NLG demands. For (8) we can now read (14). squares(s) clustered to: 4 Computing referring expressions At this point, we have an understanding of what kinds of representations we can use to describe the derivation of plural referring expressions. But we still must devise appropriate reasoning methods for these representations. The problem is the subject of this section. Constraints The first step is to formulate a constraint-satisfaction heuristic that accounts for cover-constraints on collections. In general, constraint-satisfaction heuristics provide a technique for approximating the interpretation of a description. The key notion is that of a NETWORK a description L, which a tuple C of VALUES. This tuple specifies a generous set of possible val- Ci for each variable in x; it is obtained by conservatively eliminating values that are determined to be inconsistent with L according to heuristic tests. For example, the usual arc-consistency heuristic for a constraint over individuals K(x) is to eliminate a r for variable z unless some [K(x)]j and all We will adapt this to the case of cover constraints with the following test of consistency. An individvalue for a variable xi maintains its membership in C, in the.presence,of.a collective.eonstraint whenever to a which participates directly in the relation denoted by (x) with sets of possible values for the other variables. This criterion is spelled out formally in the definition in (15). Value r for variable is COVER-CONSISTENT (C-CONSisTENT) constraint C if there is an E [[L(x)]]with Gi and C Ck all values of xi in are not c-consistent constraint x) may be deleted from as they will not satisfy the constraint. Doing so ARC with respect to C)Li(x), and provides the basic step in a network-based arcconsistency constraint-satisfier. As with ordinary constraint satisfaction, we arrive at a final tuple of values for x by starting with an initial tuple Co of an assignment giving each variqueue of arcs linking each (DL)(x) that constrains it. Until the queue is empty, we select an arc and enforce the arc c-consistency pruning Ci; if we requeue all arcs that might no longer be arc e-consistent after the deletion. I will refer to the final tuple of values as C0), for the network on description L and domains Co. The properties of this algorithm are in line with ordinary constraint satisfaction. The output will not provide all and only solutions to the constraints without further assumptions about the constraints. However, we can show, as usual, that the network converges on consistent values for variables in the ordinary linguistic case where the constraint graph is a tree—a semantic property, that there are no disjoint sets of constraints that overlap on the same two variables, that follows under plausible assumptions about the derivation of semantics from a treestructured syntax. We can show further that these values, together with the triples in [I.Li(x)] that cover these values, determine precisely the collection of assignments /(L). 4.2 Search for Referring Expressions The second step is to formalize the task of constructing a description as a state-space search task. Suppressing details of form for exposition, each state is a tuple E as set out in (16). (16) E = (L,r,R.x,P(L;R,Dx),P(L;Dr,Dx) The state represents: (17)a a description L; a tuple distinguished free variables in the description for which we must identify specific intended values; tuple R of sets describing the value which we intend for the corresponding • the free variables of the 121 a constraint network - • the values for all the free variables in the description, on the assumption that the distinguished variables take on the values we intend; and f a constraint network P(L; Dr, Dx) describing the values for all the free variables in the description, on the assumption that the distinguished variables may, like other variables, take on any values from the context set. The distinction between the variables whose intended reference is fixed and those for which it is derived as a byproduct of the search process is due to Horacek (Horacek, 1995; Horacek, 1996); the distinction derives increased importance when relating one collection to another as the choice of collections need not give rise to explicit branching in search. The initial state involves an empty description and so has the form given in (18). E KO, r, R, (),P(0; , state as represents a final state that successfully resolves the generation task when each x from and x is associated with the same CI, in both P(L;R,Dx) and P(L; Dx). simply means that the hearer&apos;s interpretation of the matches the speaker&apos;s intended interpretation. At any state E, the grammar defines a set of conof the form OL(rx; that could potentially added to description to obtain is some relation, x name the old variables from L while y names fresh variables. Of course, want to our attention to constraints that are compatible with our intended interpretation. To this we begin by computing the constraint network P(Ii; We whenever R assigns value tox, that this test admits the,new constraint, the state obtained from state E is computed as in (19). (19) 4.3 An Example return to ( I ) to provide an illustration of the goal is to identify segments in among those in (20a). I use refto figures, in ,p lace network s ; description uses the variable states prothus: (20)a (0, ,), (20f)) ,, (20d) , (20 f)) C)intersecting(r)} , , () , (20d) , C)intersecting(r), ,r,R, (20f)) thoughts Descriptions of sets obviously have much in common with expressions that describe a single entity from the shared context.

(Green et al., 1998a; Green et al., 1998b) show how such descriptions may be represented and in NLG at high-level process of content or rhetorical planning. At the same time, plurals and singulars are alike in offering resources for reference—such as pronouns, one-anaphora or aggregated expressions—that bypass explicit description altogether. The use of these resources may be quite.-closely dependent on the surface forth being generated and so could reflect a relatively late decision in the generation process (Dale and Haddock, 122 1991; Reiter, 1994; Dalianis, 1996). These complexities notwithstanding, we can expect many descriptions of sets, like descriptions of individuals, to be formulated from scratch to achieve purely referential goals during the SEN- PLANNING. phase of conand surface realization (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992; Reiter, 1994). I have shown that using covers to abstract collective and distributive readings-and using sets of assignments to represent plural references-yields a search space for this problem which largely mirrors that for singulars, and which avoids computation and search over sets of collections. Although sets proliferate explosively, it is no surprise that the search space for plurals set up by (19) is, like that for singulars, ultimately defined by the sequences of elements that make up descriptions. NLG involves search to use words effectively-choices of words should be the only decisions a referring expression generation system has to make. Acknowledgments This paper benefits from the comments of anonymous referees and from discussions with Kees van Deemter, Roger Schwarzschild, Bonnie Webber, the Edinburgh generation group, and the participants of the GNOME workshop where a preliminary version was presented; it was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from RuCCS.</abstract>

Likewise, scalar implicature, as illustrated in (3b), depends on distinguishing one claim—my passing, say—as the strongest claim that can be supported among some salient set of claims C—students in the class passing, for (3b). Rooth formalizes the focus marking in these examples as contributing a presupposition that helps to identify these alternative sets. More generally, a range of lexical items, including the morpheme other from (3c), carry discourse presuppositions that relate their referent to salient alternatives from the context—like the students we accommodate in understanding (3c) (Bierner and Webber, 2000). Overtly, all the examples in (3) involve singular noun phrases that specify isolated individuals.

In any case, the search starts with a structure defining an empty description, which means nothing and could refer to anything. Structures are then extended and considered in turn until the interpretation satisfies the system&apos;s goals (for example because it allows only a specified value, the intended referent, for a particular variable). The process of extension simply consists of deriving a more elaborate form with a richer meaning using the generator&apos;s linguistic resources it is useful to think of obtaining th</context>

By using the assignment-set semantics, we can dispense with explicit collections in formalizing an interpretation such as that schematized in (4c); we represent only the individuals involved. O The COVER semantics for predications about pluralities provides a simple scheme of implicit quantification to abstract collective and distributive predication (Gillon, 1987; Verkuyl and van der Does, 1991; Schwarzschild, 1994; Sehwarzschild, 1996)..The cover semantics offers an elegant, and convenient, definition of what it means for the set distinguished in (4c) to be characterized as the squares clustered somewhere. Section 4 presents the computational model of plural descriptions based on these principles. In keeping with (4), this model simply and naturally extends the models used to generate-singular references.

Some sentences in discourse aggregate cases together, to express relationships that hold collectively among groups. Other sentences, like (6), zoom in on individual cases, and describe distributive properties which hold of isolated individuals. In zooming in on cases, rather than individuals, these sentences maintain and extend the dependencies and other relationships that define a case.

We cannot expect a single process to be responsible for set descriptions across all intentions or stages of NLG.

(Green et al., 1998a; Green et al., 1998b) show how such descriptions may be represented and formulated in NLG at a high-level process of content or rhetorical planning. At the same time, plurals and singulars are alike in offering resources for reference—such as pronouns, one-anaphora or aggregated expressions—that bypass explicit description altogether. The use of these resources may be quite.-closely dependent on the surface forth being generated and so could reflect a relatively late decision in the generation process (Dale and Haddock, 122 1991; Reiter, 1994; Dalianis, 1996). These complexities notwithstanding, we can expect many descriptions of sets, like descriptions of individuals, to be formulated from scratch to achieve purely referential goals during the SENTENCE PLANNING. phase of NLG,-_between content planning and surface realization (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992; Reiter, 1994). I have shown that using covers to abstract collective and distributive readings-and using sets of assignments to represent plural references-yields a search space for this problem which largely mirrors that for singulars, and which avoids computation and search over </context>

Reference to sets is more general than picturesque examples like (1) and (2) might suggest. Linguistic research suggests that covert reference to SETS OF SALIENT ALTERNATIVES plays a pervasive and fundamental role in mediating between the meanings of sentences, and their interpretations in context. Consider (3), forexample. 0EI (2) a 116 (3) a Only [Mary]F passed. b Well, [1]F. passed. c Another student passed. According to (Rooth, 1992), the interpretation of focusing adverbs such as-onlyTelates an-instance a-to a set of alternatives C: the adverb describes a property that makes a unique in C. Thus in (3a) Mary is unique among some set C of individuals in passing. Likewise, scalar implicature, as illustrated in (3b), depends on distinguishing one claim—my passing, say—as the strongest claim that can be supported among some salient set of claims C—students in the class passing, for (3b). Rooth formalizes the focus marking in these examples as contributing a presupposition that helps to identify these alternative sets. More ge</context>

By using the assignment-set semantics, we can dispense with explicit collections in formalizing an interpretation such as that schematized in (4c); we represent only the individuals involved. O The COVER semantics for predications about pluralities provides a simple scheme of implicit quantification to abstract collective and distributive predication (Gillon, 1987; Verkuyl and van der Does, 1991; Schwarzschild, 1994; Sehwarzschild, 1996)..The cover semantics offers an elegant, and convenient, definition of what it means for the set distinguished in (4c) to be characterized as the squares clustered somewhere. Section 4 presents the computational model of plural descriptions based on these principles. In keeping with (4), this model simply and naturally extends the models used to generate-singular references. In particular, as (4) suggests, this model continues to structure the search space for generation in terms of flu o LI (4) a b The squares. 7 LI E 117 the words that can be added to the description an</context>

Some sentences in discourse aggregate cases together, to express relationships that hold collectively among groups. Other sentences, like (6), zoom in on individual cases, and describe distributive properties which hold of isolated individuals. In zooming in on cases, rather than individuals, these sentences maintain and extend the dependencies and other relationships that define a case. The second half of the answer derives from the observation, made in (Gillon, 1987; Verkuyl and van der Does, 1991; Schwarzschild, 1994; Schwarzschild; -I99.6); :that .the .collective-and distributive readings of plurals represent only the extremes in a larger space of readings. Take (7): (7) Rogers, Hammerstein and Hart wrote musicals. This sentence is true, but only in virtue of the joint action of Rogers and Hammerstein in writing some musicals and the-joint acaion-ofRoeers and Hart in - writing other musicals. As a matter of fact, the three never wrote a musical individually or as a single team, so both the collective and distributive readings are false. We will follow Schwarzschild&apos;s proposal most closely. Schwarzschild </context>
