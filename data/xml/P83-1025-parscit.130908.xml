This paper reviews discourse phenomena that occur frequently
in task-oriented man-machine dialogs, reporting on in empirical
study that demonstrates the necessity of handling ellipsis,
anaphora, extragrammaticality, inter-sentential metalanguage,
and other abbreviatory devices in order to achieve convivial user
interaction. Invariably, users prefer to generate terse or
fragmentary utterances instead of longer, more complete &amp;quot;stand-
alone&amp;quot; expressions, even when given clear instructions to the
contrary. The XCALIBUR expert system interface is designed to
meet these needs, including generalized ellipsis resolution by
means of a rule-based caseframe method superior to previous
semantic grammar approaches.

1. A Summary of Task-Oriented
Discourse Phenomena
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999780466666667">
Natural language discourse exhibits several intriguing
phenomena that defy definitive linguistic analysis and general
computational solutions. However, some progress has been
made in developing tractable computational solutions to
simplified version of phenomena such as ellipsis and anaphora
resolution [20, 10, 21]. This paper reviews discourse phenomena
that arise in task-oriented dialogs with responsive agents (such
as expert systems, rather than purely passive data base query
systems), outlines the results of an empirical study, and presents
our method for handling generalized ellipsis resolution in the
XCALIBUR expert system interface. With the exception of inter-
sentential metalanguage, and to a lesser degree
extragrammaticality, the significance of the phenomena listed
below have long been recognized and documented in the
computational linguistics literature.

• Anaphora -- Interactive task-oriented dialogs invite the
use of anaphora. much more so than simpler data base
query situations.
• Definite noun phrases As Grosz [6] noted, resolving
the referent of definite noun phrases requires an

cooperative discourse.

recognized as ubiquitous in discourse. However, semantic
ellipsis, where ellipsed information is manifest not as
syntactically incomplete structures, but as semantically
incomplete propositions, is also an important
phenomenon. The ellipsis resolution method presented
later in this paper addresses both kinds of ellipsis.
•Extragrammatical utterances -- Interjections, dropped
articles, false starts, misspellings, and other forms of
grammatical deviance abound in our data (as explained in
the following section). Developing robust parsing
techniques that tolerate errors has been the focus of our
earlier investigations [2, 9, 7] and remains high among our
priorities. Other investigations on error-tolerant parsing
include [13, 22].

metalanguage has been investigated to some degree
[18, 12], but its more common inter-sentential counterpart
has received little attention [4]. However, utterances about
other utterances (e.g„ corrections of previous commands,
such as &amp;quot;I meant to type X instead&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I should have said
...&amp;quot;) are not infrequent in our dialogs, and we are making
an initial stab at this problem [8]. Note that it is a
cognitively less demanding task for a user to correct a
previous utterance than to repeat an explicit sequence of
commands (or worse yet, to detect and undo explicitly
each and every unwanted consequence of a mistaken
command).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9727866">
• Indirect speech acts Occasionally users will resort to
indirect speech acts [19. 16. 1], especially in connection
with inter-sentential metalanguage or by stating a desired
state of affairs and expecting the system to supply the
sequence of actions necessary to achieve that state.

In our prior work we have focused on extragrammaticality and
inter-sentential metalanguage. In this paper we report on an
empirical study of discourse phenomena to a simulated interface
and on our work on generalized ellipsis resolution in the context
of the XCALIBUR project.

2. An Empirical Study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999114357142857">
The necessity to handle most of the discourse phenomena
listed in the preceding section was underscored by an empirical
study we conducted to ascertain the most pressing needs of
natural language interfaces in interactive applications. The initial
objective of this study was to circumscribe the natural language
interface task by attempting to instruct users of a simulated
interface not to employ different discourse devices or difficult
linguistic constructs. In essence, we wanted to determine
whether untrained users would be able to interact as instructed
(for instance avoiding all anaphoric referents), and, if so, whether
they would still find the interface convivial given our artificial
constraints.
The basic experimental set-up consisted of two remotely
located terminals linked to each other and a transaction log file
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997684">
164
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99404705882353">
that kept a record of all interactions. The user was,situated at one
terminal and was told he or she was communicating with a real
natural language interface to an operating system (and an
accompanying intelligent help system, not unlike Wilensky&apos;s Unix
Consultant (231.) The experimenter at the other terminal
simulated the interface and gave appropriate commands to the
(real) operating system.
In different sessions, users were instructed not to use
pronouns, to type only complete sentences, to avoid complex
syntax, to type only direct commands or queries (e.g., no indirect
speech acts or discourse-level metalinguistic utterances [4, 8]),
and to stick to the topic. The only instructions that were reliably
followed were sticking to the topic (always) and avoiding
complex syntax (usually). All other instructions were repeatedly
violated in spite of constant negative feedback that is, the
person pretending to be the natural language program replied
with a standard error message. I recorded some verbal
responses as well (with users telling a secretary at the terminal
what she should type), and, contrary to my expectations, these
did not qualitatively differ from the typed utterances. The
significant result here is that users appear incapable or unwilling
to generate lengthy commands, queries or statements when they
can employ a linguistic device to state the same proposition in a
more terse manner. To restate the principle more succinctly:
Terseness principle: users insist on being as terse
as possible, independent of communication media or
typing ability.1
Given these results, we concluded that it was more appropriate
to focus our investigations on handling abbreviatory discourse
devices, rather than to address the issue of expanding our
syntactic coverage to handle verbose complex structures seldom
observed in our experience. In this manner, the objectives of the
XCALIBUR project differ from those of most current
investigations.

3. A Sketch of the XCALIBUR interface
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96734315">
This section outlines the XCALIBUR project, whose objective is
to provide flexible natural language access (comprehension and
generation) to the XSEL expert system [15). XSEL, the Digital
Equipment Corporation&apos;s automated salesman&apos;s assistant,
advises on selection of appropriate VAX components and
produces a sales order for automatic configuration by the R1
system [14). Part of the XSEL task is to provide the user with
information about DEC components, hence subsuming the data-
base query task. However, unlike a pure data base query system,
an expert system interface must also interpret corty&amp;quot;-^^ds,
understand assertions of new information, and carry out task.
oriented dialogs (such as those discussed by Grosz [6]).
XCALIBUR, in particular, deals with commands to modify an
order, as well as information requests pertaining to its present
task or its data base of VAX component parts. In the near future it
should process clarificational dialogs when the underlying expert
system (i.e. XSEL) requires additional information or advice, as
illustrated in the sample dialog below:
&gt;What is the largest 11780 fixed disk under $40,000?
The rp07-aa is a 516 MB fixed pack disk that costs $38,000.

passed a message indicating the case frame or class of case
frames expected as a response. For our example, assume that a
command or query is expected, the parser is notified, and the
user enters
&gt;What is the price of the 2 largest dual port fixed media disks?
The parser returns:

Rather than delving into the details of the representation or the
manner in which it is transformed prior to generating an internal
command to XSEL, consider some of the functions of the
information handler:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9448828">
• Defaults must be instantiated. In the example, the query
does not explicitly name an INFO-SOURCE, which could be
the component database, the current set of line-items, or a
set of disks brought into focus by the preceding dialog.
• Ambiguous fillers or attribute names must be resolved. For
example, in most contexts. &amp;quot;300 MB disk&amp;quot; means a disk
with &amp;quot;greater than or equal to 300 MB&amp;quot;. rather than strictly
&amp;quot;equal to 300 MB&amp;quot;. A &amp;quot;large&amp;quot; disk refers to ample memory
capacity in the context of a functional component
specification, but to large physical dimensions during site
planning. Presently, a small amount of local pragmatic
knowledge suffices for the analysis, but, in the general
case, closer integration with XSEL may be required.
• Generalized ellipsis resolution, as presented below, occurs
within the information handler.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999860625">
As the reader may note, the present raison d&apos;etre of the
information manager is to act as a repository of task and dialog
knowledge providing information that the user did not feel
necessary to convey explicitly. Additionally, the information
handler routes the parsed command or query to the appropriate
knowledge source, be it an external static data base, an expert
system. or a dynamically constructed data structure (such as the
current VAX order). Our plans call for incorporating a model of
the user&apos;s task and knowledge state that should provide useful
information to both parser and generator. At first, we intend to
focus on stereotypical users such as a salesperson, a system
engineer and a customer, who would have rather different
domain knowledge, perhaps different vocabulary, and certainly
different sets of tasks in mind. Eventually, refinements and
updates to a default user model should be inferred from an
analysis of the current dialog (171.

4. Generalized Casef rame Ellipsis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999419833333333">
The XCALIBUR system handles ellipsis at the case-frame level.
Its coverage appears to be a superset of the LIFER/LADDER
system [10, 11] and the PLANES ellipsis module (211. Although it
handles most of the ellipsed utterances we encountered, it is not
meant to be a general linguistic solution to the ellipsis
phenomenon.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.892204">
4.1. Examples
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.959789619047619">
The following examples are illustrative of the kind of sentence
fragments the current case-frame method handles. For brevity,
assume that each sentence fragment occurs immediately
following the initial query below.
INITIAL QUERY: &amp;quot;What is the price of the three largest
single port fixed media disks?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Speed?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Two smallest?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;How about the price of the two smallest?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;also the smallest with dual ports&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Speed with two ports?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Disk with two ports.&amp;quot;
In the representative examples above, punctuation is of no help,
and pure syntax is of very limited utility. For instance, the last
three phrases are syntactically similar (indeed, the last two are
indistinguishable), but each requires that a different substitution
be made on the preceding query. All three substitute the number
of ports in the original SELECT field, but the first substitutes
&amp;quot;ascending&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;descending&amp;quot; in the °PEI:IA-nom field, the
second substitutes &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;price&amp;quot; in the PROJECT field, and
the third merely repeats the case header of the SELECT field.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.981868">
4.2. The Ellipsis Resolution Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993633090909091">
Ellipsis is resolved differently in the presence or absence of
strong discourse expectations. In the former case, the discourse
expectation rules are tested first, and, if they fail to resolve the
sentence fragment, the contextual substitution rules are tried. If
there are no strong discourse expectations. the contextual
substitution rules are invoked directly.
Exemplary discourse expectation rule:
IF, The system generated a query for confirmation or
disconfirmation of a proposed value of a filler
of a case in a case frame in focus.
THEN EXPECT one or more of the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.960017">
1) A confirmation or disconfirmation pattern.
2) A different but semantically permissible filler
of the case frame in question (optionally naming
the attribute or providing the case marker).
3) A comparative or evaluative pattern.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98667695">
A) A query for possible fillers or constraints on
possible fillers of the case in question.
[If this expectation is confirmed, a suo-dialog
is entered, wnere previously focused entities
remain in focus.]
The following dialog fragment, presented without further
commentary, illustrates how these expectations come into play in
a focused dialog:
)Add a line printer with graphics capabilities.
Is 150 lines per minute acceptable?
&gt;No. 320 is better Expectations 1, 2 &amp; 3
(or) other options for the speed? Expectation 4
(or) Too slow, try 300 or faster Expectations 2 &amp; 3
The utterance &amp;quot;try 300 or faster&amp;quot; is syntactically a complete
sentence, but semantically it is lust as fragmentary as the
previous utterances. The strong discourse expectations,
however, suggest that it be processed in the same manner as
syntactically incomplete utterances, since it satisfies the
expectations of the interactive task. The terseness principle
operates at all levels: syntactic, semantic and pragmatic.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997522">
166
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997282">
The contextual substitution rules exploit the semantic
representation of queries and commands discussed in the
previous section. The scope of these rules, however, is limited to
the last user interaction of appropriate type in the dialog focus,
as illustrated in the following example:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.645262">
Contextual Substitution Rule 1:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.690763272727273">
IF: An attribute name (or conjoined list of attribute
names) is present without any corresponding filler
or case header, and the attribute is a semantically
permissible descriptor of the case frame in the
SELECT field or the last query in focus.
THEN: Substitute the new attribute name for the old filler
of the nnCuEcT field of the last query.
For example, this rule resolves the ellipsis in the following
utterances:
&gt;What is the size of the 3 largest single port fixed media disks?
&gt;And the price and speed?
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.604121">
Contextual Substitution Rule 2:
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.961150892857143">
IF: No sentential case frames are recognized in the
input, and part of the input can be recognized as an
attribute S filler (or just a filler) of a case in
the SELECT field of a command or query in focus.
THEN: Substitute the new filler for the old in the same
field of the old command or query.
This rule resolves the following kind of ellipsis:
&gt;What is the size of the 3 largest single port fixed media disks?
&gt;disks with two ports?
Note that it is impossible to resolve this kind of ellipsis in a
general manner if the previous query is stored verbatim or as a a
semantic-grammar parse tree. &amp;quot;Disks with two ports&amp;quot; would at
best correspond to some &lt;di sk-descr I ptor&gt; non-terminal,
and hence, according to the LIFER algorithm (10, 11], would
replace the entire phrase &amp;quot;single port fixed media disks&amp;quot; that
corresponded to &lt;d sk-descr I ptor&gt; in the parse of the
original query. However, an informal poll of potential users
suggests that the preferred interpretation of the ellipsis retains
the MEDIA specifier of the original query. The ellipsis resolution
process, therefore, requires a finer grain substation method than
simply inserting the highest level non-terminals in the in the
ellipsed input in place of the matching non-terminals in the parse
tree of the previous utterance.
Taking advantage of the fact that a case frame analysis of a
sentence or object description captures the meaningful semantic
relations among its constituents in a canonical manner, a
partially instantiated nominal case frame can be merged with the
previous case frame as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.922071066666667">
• Substitute any cases instantiated in the original query that
the ellipsis specifically overrides. For instance &amp;quot;with two
ports&amp;quot; overrides &amp;quot;single port&amp;quot; in our example, as both
entail different values of the same case descriptor,
regardless of their different syntactic roles. (&amp;quot;Single port&amp;quot;
in the original query is an adjectival construction, whereas
&amp;quot;with two ports&amp;quot; is a post-nominal modifier in the ellipsed
fragment.)
• Retain any cases in the original parse that are not explicitly
contradicted by new information in the ellipsed fragment.
For instance, &amp;quot;fixed media&amp;quot; is retained as part of the disk
description, as are all the sentential-level cases in the
original query, such as the quantity specifier and the
projection attribute of the query (&amp;quot;size&amp;quot;).
• Add cases of a case frame in the query that are not
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.932576066666667">
instantiated therein, but are specified in the ellipsed
fragment. For instance, the &amp;quot;fixed head&amp;quot; descriptor is
added as the media case of the disk nominal case frame in
resolving the ellipsed fragment in the following example:
&gt;Which disks are configurable on a VAX 11-780?
&gt;Any configurable fixed head disks?
• In the event that a new case frame is mentioned in the
ellipsed fragment, wholesale substitution occurs, much like
in the semantic grammar approach. For instance, if after
the last example one were to ask &amp;quot;How about tape
drives?&amp;quot;, the substitution would replace &amp;quot;fixed head disks&amp;quot;
with &amp;quot;tape drives&amp;quot;, rather than replacing only &amp;quot;disks&amp;quot; and
producing the phrase &amp;quot;fixed head tape drives&amp;quot;, which is
meaningless in the current domain. In these instances the
semantic relations captured in a case frame representation
and not in a semantic grammar parse tree prove
immaterial.
The key to case-frame ellipsis resolution is matching
corresponding cases, rather than surface strings, syntactic
structures, or non-canonical representations. It is true that in
order to instantiate correctly a sentential or nominal case frame
in the parsing process requires semantic knowledge, some of
which can be rather domain specific. But, once the parse is
attained, the resulting canonical representation, encoding
appropriate semantic relations. can and should be exploited to
provide the system with additional functionality such as the
present ellipsis resolution method.
The major problem with semantic grammars is that they
convolve syntax with semantics in a manner that requires
multiple representations for the same semantic entity. For
instance, the ordering of marked cases in the input does not
reflect any difference in meaning (although one could argue that
surface ordering may reflect differential emphasis and other
pragmatic considerations). A pure semantic grammar must
employ different rules to recognize each and every admissible
case sequence. Hence, the resultant parse trees differ, and the
knowledge that surface positioning of unmarked cases is
meaningful, but positioning of maked ones is not, must be
contained within the ellipsis resolution process. a very unnatural
repository for such basic information. Moreover, in order to attain
a measure of the functionality described above for case-frames,
ellipsis resolution in semantic grammar parse trees must
somehow merge adjectival and post nominal forms
(corresponding to different non-terminals and different relative
positions in the parse trees) so that ellipsed structures such as &amp;quot;a
disk with 1 port&amp;quot; can replace the the &amp;quot;dual-port&amp;quot; part of the
phrase &amp;quot;...dual-port fixed-media disk ...&amp;quot; in an earlier utterance.
One way to achieve this effect is to collect together specific
nonterminals that can substitute for each other in certain
contexts, in essence grouping non-canonical representations
into semantic equivalence classes. However, this process would
require hand-crafting large associative tables or similar data
structures, a high price to pay for each domain-specific semantic
grammar. Hence, in order to achive robust ellipsis resolution all
proverbial roads lead to recursive case constructions encoding
domain semantics and canonical structure for multiple surface
manifestations.
Finally, consider one more rule that provides additional context
in situations where the ellipsis is of a purely semantic nature,
such as:

We need to answer the question &amp;quot;largest what?&amp;quot; before
proceeding. One can call this problem a special case of definite
noun phrase resolution, rather than semantic ellipses, but
terminology is immaterial. Such phrases occur with regularity in
our corpus of examples and must be resolved by a fairly general
process. The following rule answers the question from context,
regardless of the syntactic completeness of the new utterance.
Contextual Substitution Rule 3:
IF: A command or query caseframe lacks one or more
required case fillers (such as a missing SELECT
field), and the last case frame in focus has an
instantiated case that meets all the semantic tests
for the case missing the filler.
THEN: I) Copy the filler onto the new caseframe. and

XCALIBUR presently has eight contextual substitution rules.
similar to the ones above, and we have found several additional
ones to extend the coverage of ellipsed queries and commands
(see [3] for a more extensive discussion). It is significant to note
that a small set of fairly general rules exploiting the case frame
structures cover most instances of commonly occurring ellipsis,
including all the examples presented earlier in this section.

<abstract confidence="0.987164564935066">This paper reviews discourse phenomena that occur frequently in task-oriented man-machine dialogs, reporting on in empirical study that demonstrates the necessity of handling ellipsis, anaphora, extragrammaticality, inter-sentential metalanguage, and other abbreviatory devices in order to achieve convivial user interaction. Invariably, users prefer to generate terse or fragmentary utterances instead of longer, more complete &amp;quot;standalone&amp;quot; expressions, even when given clear instructions to the contrary. The XCALIBUR expert system interface is designed to meet these needs, including generalized ellipsis resolution by means of a rule-based caseframe method superior to previous approaches. 1. A Summary of Task-Oriented Discourse Phenomena language discourse exhibits intriguing phenomena that defy definitive linguistic analysis and general solutions. However, some progress made in developing tractable computational solutions to simplified version of phenomena such as ellipsis and anaphora resolution [20, 10, 21]. This paper reviews discourse phenomena task-oriented dialogs with responsive agents (such as expert systems, rather than purely passive data base query systems), outlines the results of an empirical study, and presents our method for handling generalized ellipsis resolution in the XCALIBUR expert system interface. With the exception of intersentential metalanguage, and to a lesser degree extragrammaticality, the significance of the phenomena listed below have long been recognized and documented in the computational linguistics literature. Anaphora -task-oriented dialogs invite the use of anaphora. much more so than simpler data base query situations. Definite noun phrases Grosz [6] noted, resolving referent of definite noun requires an understanding of the planning structure underlying cooperative discourse. • Ellipsis Sentential level ellipsis has long been as ubiquitous in discourse. However, ellipsed information is manifest not as syntactically incomplete structures, but as semantically incomplete propositions, is also an important phenomenon. The ellipsis resolution method presented later in this paper addresses both kinds of ellipsis. Extragrammatical utterances -dropped articles, false starts, misspellings, and other forms of grammatical deviance abound in our data (as explained in section). Developing robust parsing techniques that tolerate errors has been the focus of our earlier investigations [2, 9, 7] and remains high among our priorities. Other investigations on error-tolerant parsing include [13, 22]. • Meta-linguistic utterances -- Intra-sentential has investigated to some degree [18, 12], but its more common inter-sentential counterpart has received little attention [4]. However, utterances about other utterances (e.g„ corrections of previous commands, such as &amp;quot;I meant to type X instead&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I should have said ...&amp;quot;) are not infrequent in our dialogs, and we are making an initial stab at this problem [8]. Note that it is a cognitively less demanding task for a user to correct a previous utterance than to repeat an explicit sequence of commands (or worse yet, to detect and undo explicitly each and every unwanted consequence of a mistaken command). Indirect speech acts Occasionally users to indirect speech acts [19. 16. 1], especially in connection inter-sentential metalanguage or stating a desired state of affairs and expecting the system to supply the sequence of actions necessary to achieve that state. prior work we have focused on extragrammaticality and metalanguage. In this we report an empirical study of discourse phenomena to a simulated interface and on our work on generalized ellipsis resolution in the context of the XCALIBUR project. 2. An Empirical Study The necessity to handle most of the discourse phenomena listed in the preceding section was underscored by an empirical study we conducted to ascertain the most pressing needs of natural language interfaces in interactive applications. The initial objective of this study was to circumscribe the natural language interface task by attempting to instruct users of a simulated interface not to employ different discourse devices or difficult linguistic constructs. In essence, we wanted to determine whether untrained users would be able to interact as instructed instance all anaphoric referents), and, if so, whether they would still find the interface convivial given our artificial constraints. The basic experimental set-up consisted of two remotely located terminals linked to each other and a transaction log file 164 that kept a record of all interactions. The user was,situated at one terminal and was told he or she was communicating with a real natural language interface to an operating system (and an accompanying intelligent help system, not unlike Wilensky&apos;s Unix Consultant (231.) The experimenter at the other terminal simulated the interface and gave appropriate commands to the (real) operating system. different sessions, users not to use pronouns, to type only complete sentences, to avoid complex syntax, to type only direct commands or queries (e.g., no indirect speech acts or discourse-level metalinguistic utterances [4, 8]), and to stick to the topic. The only instructions that were reliably followed were sticking to the topic (always) and avoiding complex syntax (usually). All other instructions were repeatedly violated in spite of constant negative feedback that is, the person pretending to be the natural language program replied with a standard error message. I recorded some verbal responses as well (with users telling a secretary at the terminal what she should type), and, contrary to my expectations, these did not qualitatively differ from the typed utterances. The significant result here is that users appear incapable or unwilling to generate lengthy commands, queries or statements when they can employ a linguistic device to state the same proposition in a more terse manner. To restate the principle more succinctly: principle: insist on being as terse as possible, independent of communication media or Given these results, we concluded that it was more appropriate to focus our investigations on handling abbreviatory discourse devices, rather than to address the issue of expanding our syntactic coverage to handle verbose complex structures seldom in our experience. In this manner, the objectives XCALIBUR project differ from those of most current investigations. 3. A Sketch of the XCALIBUR interface This section outlines the XCALIBUR project, whose objective is to provide flexible natural language access (comprehension and generation) to the XSEL expert system [15). XSEL, the Digital Equipment Corporation&apos;s automated salesman&apos;s assistant, advises on selection of appropriate VAX components and produces a sales order for automatic configuration by the R1 system [14). Part of the XSEL task is to provide the user with information about DEC components, hence subsuming the database query task. However, unlike a pure data base query system, expert system interface must also interpret understand assertions of new information, and carry out task. oriented dialogs (such as those discussed by Grosz [6]). XCALIBUR, in particular, deals with commands to modify an order, as well as information requests pertaining to its present task or its data base of VAX component parts. In the near future it should process clarificational dialogs when the underlying expert system (i.e. XSEL) requires additional information or advice, as illustrated in the sample dialog below: &gt;What is the largest 11780 fixed disk under $40,000? The rp07-aa is a 516 MB fixed pack disk that costs $38,000. &gt;The largest under $50,000? The rp07-aa. &gt;Add two rp07-aa disks to my order. Line item 1 added: (2 rp07-aa) &gt;Add a printer with graphics capability fixed or changeable font? lines per minute? &gt;make it at least 200, upper/lowercase. OK. Line item 2 added: (1 lxy11-sy) &gt;Tell me about the lxyll The lxy11 is a 240I/m line printer with plotting capabilities. the exception of system-driven clarification interchange, which is beyond XCALIBUR&apos;s presently capabilities, the of the dialog, including the natural language generation, is indicative of the present state of our system. The major contributions of XCALIBUR thus far is Perhaps the integration of diverse techniques into a working system. including the DYPAR-II multi-strategy parser. expectation-based error correction. case frame ellipsis USER alr I— IP XSEL R1 Information Manager Dypar•ll Order Database XCALIOUR Long twin (:.1tatic) Database Figure 3.1: Overview of XCALIBUR 1 Indicative as these empirical studies are of where one must focus one&apos;s efforts in developing convivial interfaces, they were not performed with adequate control groups or statistical rigor. Therefore, there is ample room to confirm, or expand upon the details of findings. However, the strong form Grice&apos;s maxim NI manifests itself in task• oriented human computer dialogs seems qualitatively irrefutable. resolution and focused natural language generation. Figure provides a simplified of the major of XCALIBUR, and the reader is referred to [3] for further elaboration. Role of the Information Handler When XSEL is ready to accept input, the information handler is 165 passed a message indicating the case frame or class of case frames expected as a response. For our example, assume that a command or query is expected, the parser is notified, and the user enters &gt;What is the price of the 2 largest dual port fixed media disks? The parser returns: [QUERY (OBJECT (SELECT (disk (2))) (OPERATION (SORT (NUMBER (2))) ) ] Rather than delving into the details of the representation or the manner in which it is transformed prior to generating an internal command to XSEL, consider some of the functions of the information handler: • Defaults must be instantiated. In the example, the query does not explicitly name an INFO-SOURCE, which could be the component database, the current set of line-items, or a set of disks brought into focus by the preceding dialog. • Ambiguous fillers or attribute names must be resolved. For example, in most contexts. &amp;quot;300 MB disk&amp;quot; means a disk with &amp;quot;greater than or equal to 300 MB&amp;quot;. rather than strictly &amp;quot;equal to 300 MB&amp;quot;. A &amp;quot;large&amp;quot; disk refers to ample memory capacity in the context of a functional component specification, but to large physical dimensions during site planning. Presently, a small amount of local pragmatic knowledge suffices for the analysis, but, in the general case, closer integration with XSEL may be required. • Generalized ellipsis resolution, as presented below, occurs within the information handler. the reader may note, the present d&apos;etre the information manager is to act as a repository of task and dialog knowledge providing information that the user did not feel necessary to convey explicitly. Additionally, the information handler routes the parsed command or query to the appropriate source, be external static data base, an expert system. or a dynamically constructed data structure (such as the current VAX order). Our plans call for incorporating a model of the user&apos;s task and knowledge state that should provide useful information to both parser and generator. At first, we intend to focus on stereotypical users such as a salesperson, a system engineer and a customer, who would have rather different domain knowledge, perhaps different vocabulary, and certainly different sets of tasks in mind. Eventually, refinements and updates to a default user model should be inferred from an analysis of the current dialog (171. 4. Generalized Casef rame Ellipsis The XCALIBUR system handles ellipsis at the case-frame level. Its coverage appears to be a superset of the LIFER/LADDER [10, the PLANES ellipsis module (211. Although it handles most of the ellipsed utterances we encountered, it is not meant to be a general linguistic solution to the ellipsis phenomenon. 4.1. Examples The following examples are illustrative of the kind of sentence fragments the current case-frame method handles. For brevity, assume that each sentence fragment occurs immediately following the initial query below. INITIAL QUERY: &amp;quot;What is the price of the three largest single port fixed media disks?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Speed?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Two smallest?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How about the price of the two smallest?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;also the smallest with dual ports&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Speed with two ports?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Disk with two ports.&amp;quot; the representative above, punctuation is of no help, pure syntax is very limited utility. For instance, the phrases are syntactically (indeed, the last two are but requires that a different substitution be made on the preceding query. All three substitute the number ports in the original but the first substitutes for &amp;quot;descending&amp;quot; in the field, the substitutes &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;price&amp;quot; in the and third merely repeats the case header of the 4.2. The Ellipsis Resolution Method Ellipsis is resolved differently in the presence or absence of strong discourse expectations. In the former case, the discourse expectation rules are tested first, and, if they fail to resolve the fragment, the contextual substitution rules are tried. are no strong discourse expectations. contextual rules are directly. Exemplary discourse expectation rule: IF, The system generated a query for confirmation or disconfirmation of a proposed value of a filler of a case in a case frame in focus. THEN EXPECT one or more of the following: 1) A confirmation or disconfirmation pattern. 2) A different but semantically permissible filler of the case frame in question (optionally naming the attribute or providing the case marker). 3) A comparative or evaluative pattern. A) A query for possible fillers or constraints on possible fillers of the case in question. [If this expectation is confirmed, a suo-dialog entered, focused entities remain in focus.] The following dialog fragment, presented without further commentary, illustrates how these expectations come into play in a focused dialog: a printer with graphics capabilities. Is 150 lines per minute acceptable? 320 is better &amp; 3 options for the speed? 4 or faster 2 &amp; 3 The utterance &amp;quot;try 300 or faster&amp;quot; is syntactically a complete sentence, but semantically it is lust as fragmentary as the previous utterances. The strong discourse expectations, however, suggest that it be processed in the same manner as syntactically incomplete utterances, since it satisfies the expectations of the interactive task. The terseness principle at all semantic and pragmatic. 166 The contextual substitution rules exploit the semantic representation of queries and commands discussed in the previous section. The scope of these rules, however, is limited to the last user interaction of appropriate type in the dialog focus, as illustrated in the following example: Contextual Substitution Rule 1: IF: An attribute name (or conjoined list of attribute names) is present without any corresponding filler or case header, and the attribute is a semantically permissible descriptor of the case frame in the or the last query in focus. Substitute attribute name for the old filler of the nnCuEcT field of the last query. For example, this rule resolves the ellipsis in the following utterances: &gt;What is the size of the 3 largest single port fixed media disks? &gt;And the price and speed? Contextual Substitution Rule 2: sentential case frames are recognized in the input, and part of the input can be recognized as an attribute S filler (or just a filler) of a case in of a command or query in focus. THEN: Substitute the new filler for the old in the same field of the old command or query. This rule resolves the following kind of ellipsis: &gt;What is the size of the 3 largest single port fixed media disks? &gt;disks with two ports? Note that it is impossible to resolve this kind of ellipsis in a general manner if the previous query is stored verbatim or as a a semantic-grammar parse tree. &amp;quot;Disks with two ports&amp;quot; would at best correspond to some &lt;di sk-descr I ptor&gt; non-terminal, and hence, according to the LIFER algorithm (10, 11], would replace the entire phrase &amp;quot;single port fixed media disks&amp;quot; that corresponded to &lt;d sk-descr I ptor&gt; in the parse of the original query. However, an informal poll of potential users suggests that the preferred interpretation of the ellipsis retains of the original query. The ellipsis resolution process, therefore, requires a finer grain substation method than simply inserting the highest level non-terminals in the in the ellipsed input in place of the matching non-terminals in the parse tree of the previous utterance. advantage of that a case frame analysis of a sentence or object description captures the meaningful semantic relations among its constituents in a canonical manner, a partially instantiated nominal case frame can be merged with the previous case frame as follows: • Substitute any cases instantiated in the original query that the ellipsis specifically overrides. For instance &amp;quot;with two ports&amp;quot; overrides &amp;quot;single port&amp;quot; in our example, as both entail different values of the same case descriptor, regardless of their different syntactic roles. (&amp;quot;Single port&amp;quot; in the original query is an adjectival construction, whereas &amp;quot;with two ports&amp;quot; is a post-nominal modifier in the ellipsed fragment.) • Retain any cases in the original parse that are not explicitly contradicted by new information in the ellipsed fragment. For instance, &amp;quot;fixed media&amp;quot; is retained as part of the disk description, as are all the sentential-level cases in the original query, such as the quantity specifier and the projection attribute of the query (&amp;quot;size&amp;quot;). • Add cases of a case frame in the query that are not instantiated therein, but are specified in the ellipsed fragment. For instance, the &amp;quot;fixed head&amp;quot; descriptor is added as the media case of the disk nominal case frame in resolving the ellipsed fragment in the following example: &gt;Which disks are configurable on a VAX 11-780? &gt;Any configurable fixed head disks? • In the event that a new case frame is mentioned in the ellipsed fragment, wholesale substitution occurs, much like in the semantic grammar approach. For instance, if after the last example one were to ask &amp;quot;How about tape drives?&amp;quot;, the substitution would replace &amp;quot;fixed head disks&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;tape drives&amp;quot;, rather than replacing only &amp;quot;disks&amp;quot; and producing the phrase &amp;quot;fixed head tape drives&amp;quot;, which is meaningless in the current domain. In these instances the semantic relations captured in a case frame representation and not in a semantic grammar parse tree prove immaterial. key to case-frame ellipsis resolution corresponding cases, rather than surface strings, syntactic structures, or non-canonical representations. It is true that in order to instantiate correctly a sentential or nominal case frame in the parsing process requires semantic knowledge, some of can be rather domain specific. But, once the parse attained, the resulting canonical representation, encoding appropriate semantic relations. can and should be exploited to provide the system with additional functionality such as the present ellipsis resolution method. The major problem with semantic grammars is that they convolve syntax with semantics in a manner that requires multiple representations for the same semantic entity. For instance, the ordering of marked cases in the input does not reflect any difference in meaning (although one could argue that surface ordering may reflect differential emphasis and other pragmatic considerations). A pure semantic grammar must employ different rules to recognize each and every admissible case sequence. Hence, the resultant parse trees differ, and the knowledge that surface positioning of unmarked cases is meaningful, but positioning of maked ones is not, must be within the ellipsis resolution process. unnatural repository for such basic information. Moreover, in order to attain a measure of the functionality described above for case-frames, ellipsis resolution in semantic grammar parse trees must somehow merge adjectival and post nominal forms (corresponding to different non-terminals and different relative positions in the parse trees) so that ellipsed structures such as &amp;quot;a with can replace the the &amp;quot;dual-port&amp;quot; part of the phrase &amp;quot;...dual-port fixed-media disk ...&amp;quot; in an earlier utterance. One way to achieve this effect is to collect together specific that can substitute for other in certain in essence grouping non-canonical semantic equivalence classes. this process large associative tables or similar data a high price to pay domain-specific semantic grammar. Hence, in order to achive robust ellipsis resolution all proverbial roads lead to recursive case constructions encoding domain semantics and canonical structure for multiple surface manifestations. Finally, consider one more rule that provides additional context in situations where the ellipsis is of a purely semantic nature, such as: 167 fixed media disks are configurable on a VAX The RP07-aa, the RP07-ab, )&amp;quot;Add the largest&amp;quot; We need to answer the question &amp;quot;largest what?&amp;quot; before proceeding. One can call this problem a special case of definite noun phrase resolution, rather than semantic ellipses, but terminology is immaterial. Such phrases occur with regularity in our corpus of examples and must be resolved by a fairly general process. The following rule answers the question from context, regardless of the syntactic completeness of the new utterance. Contextual Substitution Rule 3: command or query caseframe lacks one or more case fillers (such as a missing field), and the last case frame in focus has an instantiated case that meets all the semantic tests for the case missing the filler. THEN: I) Copy the filler onto the new caseframe. and 2) Attempt to copy uninstantiated case fillers as well (if they meet semantic tests) 3) Echo the action being performed for implicit confirmation by the user. XCALIBUR presently has eight contextual substitution rules. similar to the ones above, and we have found several additional ones to extend the coverage of ellipsed queries and commands (see [3] for a more extensive discussion). It is significant to note that a small set of fairly general rules exploiting the case frame structures cover most instances of commonly occurring ellipsis, including all the examples presented earlier in this section.

However, semantic ellipsis, where ellipsed information is manifest not as syntactically incomplete structures, but as semantically incomplete propositions, is also an important phenomenon.

Figure 3.1 provides a simplified view of the major modules of XCALIBUR, and the reader is referred to [3] for further elaboration. 3.1. The Role of the Information Handler When XSEL is ready to accept input, the information handler is 165 passed a message indicating the case frame or class of case frames expected as a response. For our example, assume that a command or query is expected, the parser is notified, and the user enters &gt;What is the price of the 2 largest dual port fixed media disks? The parser returns: [QUERY (OBJECT (SELECT (disk (ports (VALUE (2))) (disk-pack-type (VALUE (Fixed))) (OPERATION (SORT (TYPE (descending)) (ATTR (size)) (NUMBER (2))) (PROJECT (price)) ) (INFO-SOURCE (defa</context>

THEN: I) Copy the filler onto the new caseframe. and 2) Attempt to copy uninstantiated case fillers as well (if they meet semantic tests) 3) Echo the action being performed for implicit confirmation by the user. XCALIBUR presently has eight contextual substitution rules. similar to the ones above, and we have found several additional ones to extend the coverage of ellipsed queries and commands (see [3] for a more extensive discussion). It is significant to note that a small set of fairly general rules exploiting the case frame structures cover most instances of commonly occurring ellipsis, including all the examples presented earlier in this section.

In different sessions, users were instructed not to use pronouns, to type only complete sentences, to avoid complex syntax, to type only direct commands or queries (e.g., no indirect speech acts or discourse-level metalinguistic utterances [4, 8]), and to stick to the topic. The only instructions that were reliably followed were sticking to the topic (always) and avoiding complex syntax (usually). All other instructions were repeatedly violated in spite of constant negative feedback that is, the person pretending to be the natural language program replied with a standard error message.

With the exception of intersentential metalanguage, and to a lesser degree extragrammaticality, the significance of the phenomena listed below have long been recognized and documented in the computational linguistics literature. • Anaphora -- Interactive task-oriented dialogs invite the use of anaphora. much more so than simpler data base query situations. • Definite noun phrases As Grosz [6] noted, resolving the referent of definite noun phrases requires an understanding of the planning structure underlying cooperative discourse. • Ellipsis Sentential level ellipsis has long been recognized as ubiquitous in discourse. However, semantic ellipsis, where ellipsed information is manifest not as syntactically incomplete structures, but as semantically incomplete propositions, is also an important phenomenon.

XSEL, the Digital Equipment Corporation&apos;s automated salesman&apos;s assistant, advises on selection of appropriate VAX components and produces a sales order for automatic configuration by the R1 system [14). Part of the XSEL task is to provide the user with information about DEC components, hence subsuming the database query task. However, unlike a pure data base query system, an expert system interface must also interpret corty&amp;quot;-^^ds, understand assertions of new information, and carry out task. oriented dialogs (such as those discussed by Grosz [6]). XCALIBUR, in particular, deals with commands to modify an order, as well as information requests pertaining to its present task or its data base of VAX component parts. In the near future it should process clarificational dialogs when the underlying expert system (i.e. XSEL) requires additional information or advice, as illustrated in the sample dialog below: &gt;What is the largest 11780 fixed disk under $40,000? The rp07-aa is a 516 MB fixed pack disk that costs $38,000. &gt;The largest under $50,000? The rp07-aa. &gt;Add two rp07-aa disks to my order.

The XCALIBUR expert system interface is designed to meet these needs, including generalized ellipsis resolution by means of a rule-based caseframe method superior to previous semantic grammar approaches. 1. A Summary of Task-Oriented Discourse Phenomena Natural language discourse exhibits several intriguing phenomena that defy definitive linguistic analysis and general computational solutions. However, some progress has been made in developing tractable computational solutions to simplified version of phenomena such as ellipsis and anaphora resolution [20, 10, 21]. This paper reviews discourse phenomena that arise in task-oriented dialogs with responsive agents (such as expert systems, rather than purely passive data base query systems), outlines the results of an empirical study, and presents our method for handling generalized ellipsis resolution in the XCALIBUR expert system interface.

Note that it is a cognitively less demanding task for a user to correct a previous utterance than to repeat an explicit sequence of commands (or worse yet, to detect and undo explicitly each and every unwanted consequence of a mistaken command). • Indirect speech acts Occasio</context>

A Summary of Task-Oriented Discourse Phenomena Natural language discourse exhibits several intriguing phenomena that defy definitive linguistic analysis and general computational solutions. However, some progress has been made in developing tractable computational solutions to simplified version of phenomena such as ellipsis and anaphora resolution [20, 10, 21]. This paper reviews discourse phenomena that arise in task-oriented dialogs with responsive agents (such as expert systems, rather than purely passive data base query systems), outlines the results of an empirical study, and presents our method for handling generalized ellipsis resolution in the XCALIBUR expert system interface. With the exception of intersentential metalanguage, and to a lesser degree extragrammaticality, the significance of the phenomena listed below have long been recognized and documented in the computational linguistics literature. • Anaphora -- Interactive task-oriented</context>

The ellipsis resolution method presented later in this paper addresses both kinds of ellipsis. •Extragrammatical utterances -- Interjections, dropped articles, false starts, misspellings, and other forms of grammatical deviance abound in our data (as explained in the following section). Developing robust parsing techniques that tolerate errors has been the focus of our earlier investigations [2, 9, 7] and remains high among our priorities. Other investigations on error-tolerant parsing include [13, 22]. • Meta-linguistic utterances -- Intra-sentential metalanguage has been investigated to some degree [18, 12], but its more common inter-sentential counterpart has received little attention [4].
