Question Answering provides a method of
locating precise answers to specific ques-
tions but in technical domains the amount
of Multi-Word Terms complicates this task.
This paper outlines the Question Answer-
ing task in such a domain and explores two
ways of detecting relations between Multi-
Word Terms. The first targets specific se-
mantic relations, the second uses a cluster-
ing algorithm, but they are both based on
the idea of syntactic variation. The pa-
per demonstrates how the combination of
these two methodologies provide sophisti-
cated access to technical domains.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993319342105263">
Nominal compounds are inherently ambiguous on
both the syntactic and semantic fronts. Whilst the
number of syntactic possibilities increase exponen-
tially with word length (Isabelle, 1984), semantic in-
terpretation is at best contextually dependent and in
the worst cases determined by extra-linguistic (prag-
matic) factors.&apos; Technical documentation is an at-
tractive domain in which to explore nominal com-
pounds for two reasons. First, they present an abun-
dance of compounds, secondly they restrict semantic
interpretation by excluding compounds with opaque
(extra-linguistic) interpretation. The result is multi-
word terms (MWT) which are both compositional,
their formation is a function of their constituent ele-
ments (Kageura, 2002) and endocentric, the com-
pound is a hyponym of its head (Barker and Sz-
pakowicz, 1998).
&apos;For example, &amp;quot;apple juice place&amp;quot; (Levi, 1979)
This paper addresses the issue of structuring the
Multi-Word Terms (MWTs) for Question Answer-
ing (QA) in technical domains. The central prob-
lem is that unfamiliarity with MWTs that character-
ize such domains creates an effective barrier against
users finding answers.
Section 2 outlines the domain of focus, the
MWT extraction method and examples character-
istic MWTs. Section 3 explores the QA task in tech-
nical domains by describing the ExtrAns system,
and how it structures the MWTs for the task. Sec-
tion 4 presents TermWatch which identifies syntac-
tic variants and uses a hierarchical clustering algo-
rithm to build classes of term variants. The common
ground between these two approaches is in the use
of syntactic variants to structure the terminology as
a whole. Section 5 explores how the resulting struc-
tures can be used in the QA task. After surveying
some related work in Section 6 the paper ends by
drawing conclusions on the approaches presented.

2 MWT Extraction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925375">
Before the MWTs can be structured, the terms
need to be extracted from a corpus of texts. This
stage was performed using the INTEX linguistic
parser (Silberztein, 1993). INTEX is a finite state
transducer parser. The corpus used in the present
study concerns scientific publications on the bread-
making process. It was made available by the French
Institute of Scientific Information (INIST). Without
going into much detail regarding the candidate term
extraction rules, the approach adopted can be sum-
marized as selective NLP followed by shallow pars-
ing, much in the same way as (Evans et al., 1992).
We defined morpho-syntactic properties of complex
nominal syntagms written as finite state automata,
implemented in the INTEX linguistic toolbox. IN-
TEX is equipped with linguistic resources to perform

an overall morpho-syntactic analysis on the texts.
The NP automata are applied in an iterative way
on the corpus until we reach a satisfactory medium-
grained noun phrase splitting. Our concern was to
extract more or less complex terms as they appeared
in the text corpus and not atomic NP extraction.
The rationale was to conserve the associations be-
tween terms as the scientists (authors) made them
during their write-up. Examples of candidate terms
extracted at this stage are: &amp;quot;hydrophilic powdered
lecithin, traditional sour dough starter cultures, de-
velopment of traditional bread flavour&amp;quot;. More details
on the NP splitting rules can be found in (Ibekwe-
SanJuan, 2001). Manual validation by a domain ex-
pert produced 3651 MWTs.

<bodyText confidence="0.998494738461539">
Question Answering systems attempt to extract
small snippets of text in response to a natural lan-
guage query. Briefly, ExtrAns achieves this in two
distinct stages:
Off-line the entire document collection is sub-
jected to linguistic analysis, which produces a full
syntactic parse for each sentence. After some inter-
mediate steps, such as anaphora resolution and dis-
ambiguation, the syntactic parse is translated into a
semantic representation designed to capture the core
meaning of the sentences. These representations are
stored in a Knowledge Base.
On-line user queries are subjected to the same
linguistic analysis. The resulting semantic rep-
resentation of the query is `matched&apos; against the
knowledge base. These `matches&apos; can be identified
in their original document location, so users can
contextualize these potential answers. Interest in
the specifics of this process should be directed
toward (Rinaldi et al., 2002) (Dowdall et al., 2002).
In dealing with technical domains we have iden-
tified two major obstacles for a QA system which
can be summarize as the Parsing Problem and the
Paraphrase Problem.
The Parsing Problem consists in the increased
difficulty of parsing text in a technical domain due to
domain-specific sublanguage. Various types of MWT
characterize these domains, in particular referring
to specific concepts like tools, parts or procedures.
These multi word expressions might include lexical
items which are either unknown to a generic lexicon
(e.g. &amp;quot;acetic acid&amp;quot;) or have a specific meaning unique
to this domain. Abbreviations and acronyms are an-
other common source of incosistencies. In such cases
the parser might either fail to identify the compound
as a phrase and consequently fail to parse the sen-
tence including such items. Alternatively the parser
might attempt to `guess&apos; their lexical category (in
the set of open class categories), leading to an ex-
ponential growth of the number of possible syntactic
parses. Not only the internal structure of the com-
pound can be multi-way ambiguous, even the bound-
aries of the compounds might be difficult to detect
and the parsers might try odd combinations of the
tokens belonging to the compounds with neighbour-
ing tokens.
The Paraphrase Problem resides in the imper-
fect knowledge of users of the systems, who cannot be
expected to be completely familiar with the domain
terminology. Even experienced users, who know the
domain very well, might not remember the exact
wording of a MWT and use a paraphrase to refer to
the underlying domain concept. Besides even in the
documents themselves, unless the editors have been
forced to use some strict terminology control system,
various paraphrases of the same compound will ap-
pear, and they need to be identified as co-referent.
However, it is not enough to identify all paraphrases
within the manual, novel paraphases might be cre-
ated by the users each time they query the system.
The task of QA in technical domains is to identify:
`what&apos; needs to be known about `which&apos; multi-word
term. Then to extract sentences that provide the
answer. How to find the `what&apos; is dependant on the
approach. ExtrAns uses linguistic processing which

results in a semantic representation. However, in
the TREC domain of newswire, considerable success
has been achieved by statistical measures and even
pattern matching. Here, these distinctions are unim-
portant.
What is of concern is in how to meet the two com-
peting search needs of answering specific questions
and navigating through a domain of specialized, un-
familiar MWTs.
Designed specifically for technical domains, Ex-
trAns involves strategies for exploiting the abundant
MWTs that these domains hold. The approach uti-
lizes WordNet to gather the MWTs into synonymy
sets based on variation rules. The terminology is also
related through an hyponymy hierarchy.
Synonymy between MWTs is either strict, or
detected through WordNet. Strictly synonymous
MWTs coreference a single object/concept. This
link is a result of morpho-syntactic variation taking
&amp;quot;chemical improver action&amp;quot; and producing the anit-
symmetrical term &amp;quot;action of chemical improver&amp;quot;.
The process simply involves inverting the Head and
introducing modifiers with a preposition.
WordNet synonymy, on the other hand, comes in
three types of symmetrical variation depending on
which tokens from two MWTs can be found in the
same synset:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989017833333333">
• WordNet Head substitution, (&amp;quot;bread ingestion&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;bread consumption&amp;quot;)
• WordNet modifier substitution (&amp;quot;quantity of
yeast&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;amount of yeast&amp;quot;)
• WordNet Modifier and head substitution (&amp;quot;key
ingredient&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;functional component&amp;quot;).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999885058823529">
However, synonymy identified through WordNet is
defined by WordNet. As a general lexical database
not designed for specilized domains it represents
common synonymy between words. The resulting
links created between multi-word terms translates
into concepts non-specialists cannot easily distin-
guish. These links produced 1277 synsets the vast
majority of which contain two MWTs.
Hyponymy The MWTs are organized into a lex-
ical hyponymy (is a) hierarchy that exploits their
endocentricity (Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998). The
hyponymy relation is identified through two types of
rules, Left Expansions which further modifies &amp;quot;dough
stickiness&amp;quot; to be &amp;quot;intense&amp;quot; producing &amp;quot;intense dough
stickiness&amp;quot;. Here the original head-modifier rela-
tions of the hypernym are unaltered in the hyponym.
However, with Insertion rules these relations are

changed in the potential hyponym. For example,
whatever is going on in &amp;quot;wheat dough stickiness&amp;quot;, in-
serting the word &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; to produce &amp;quot;wheat dough
surface stickiness&amp;quot; has altered the original head-
modifier relations. So a generic/specific relation is
less certain. For the moment such links are permit-
ted.
This process allows multiple parents for a given
term. So &amp;quot;wheat dough surface stickiness&amp;quot; is also
a hyponym of &amp;quot;surface stickiness&amp;quot; through a left-
expansion rule. An example of this kind of hierarchy
can be seen in figure 2.
These two structures are exploited in the search
process during `matching&apos; of queries against answers.
The strengths they bring and the limitations imposed
are explored in Section 5 after description of an al-
ternative approach to term variant structuring.

a three-level structuring of terms: term, connected
component and class levels. It integrates a visual
interface developed with the Aisee graphic visualiza-
tion to enable the user explore the classes and browse
through the links between terms. Earlier stages of
this work were presented in (Ibekwe-SanJuan, 1998).

Expansions are subdivided along the grammati-
cal axis: those that affect the modifier words in a
term and those that affect the head word. Modifier
expansions (L-Exp) describes two elementary op-
erations: left-expansion (L-Exp) and Insertion (Ins).
They both denote the addition at the leftmost po-
sition (L-Exp) or inside a term (Insertion or Ins) of
new modifier elements. For instance, &amp;quot;gas holding
property of dough&amp;quot; is a left-expansion of &amp;quot;gas holding
property&amp;quot; because by transformation to a nominal
compound structure, we obtain &amp;quot;dough gas holding
property&amp;quot;. Likewise, &amp;quot;bread dough quality character-
istics&amp;quot; is an insertion variant (Ins) of &amp;quot;bread char-
acteristics&amp;quot;. Head expansions (R-Exp) describes
the addition of one or more nominals in the head po-
sition of a term, thus shifting the former headword
to a modifier position. Thus &amp;quot;frozen sweet dough
baking&amp;quot; is a R-Exp of &amp;quot;frozen sweet dough&amp;quot;. A com-
bination of the two expansion types yield left-right
expansion (LR-Exp) in that it describes addition of
words both in the modifier and head positions. For
example, the relation between &amp;quot;nonstarch polysac-
charide&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;functional property of rye nonstarch
polysaccharide&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;rye nonstarch polysaccharide func-
tional property&amp;quot;). These relations are constrained in
that the added or inserted words have to be con-
tiguous, otherwise, we may not have the expected
semantic relations. Only nominal elements are con-
sidered (nouns, adjectives).
Substitutions are also defined along the gram-
matical axis to yield two sub-types : modifier and
head substitution. Modifier substitution (M-Sub)
describes the replacing of one modifier word in term
tl by another word in term tz. Thus &amp;quot;bread dough
leavening&amp;quot; is a modifier substitution (M-Sub) of
&amp;quot;composite dough leavening&amp;quot;. Head substitution
(H-Sub) relates terms which share the same modi-
fiers but different heads : &amp;quot;effect of xanthan gum&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;addition of xanthan gum&amp;quot;. These relations
are equally constrained in that they can only link
terms of equal length where one and only one item
is different, thus guaranteeing the interpretability of
the relations. Substitutions, since they denote non-
directional relations between terms of equal length,
engender symmetrical relations between terms on the
formal level: tlo-tz. Their transitive closure cre-
ates classes of terms. For instance, a set of terms
related by modifier substitution (M-Sub) seem to
point to a class of &amp;quot;properties/attributes&amp;quot; shared by
a same concept (the head word) as in &amp;quot;bread texture,
endosperm texture, good texture&amp;quot; for binary terms
and &amp;quot;sour corn bread, sour dough bread, sour maize
bread&amp;quot; for ternary terms. In this last case, the chang-
ing properties seem to point to the possible special-
izations (&amp;quot;sour-&amp;quot;) of the concept (&amp;quot;bread&amp;quot;). Head
substitution on the other hand gathers together sets
of terms that share the same &amp;quot;properties&amp;quot; (the mod-
ifier words), thus creating a class of &amp;quot;concepts&amp;quot;. For
instance, the set of term variants &amp;quot;frozen dough bak-
ing, frozen dough characteristics, frozen dough prod-
ucts&amp;quot;. The common attribute is &amp;quot;frozen dough&amp;quot;,
shared by this class of concepts &amp;quot;products, char-
acteristics, baking&amp;quot;. (Ibekwe-SanJuan, 1998) al-
ready put forward the idea of these semantic rela-
tions and (Jacquemin, 1995) reported similar con-
ceptual relations for his insertion and coordination
variants.

4.2 Variant Clustering Module
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962842105263">
The second module of TermWatch is a hierarchical
clustering algorithm, CPCL (Classification by Pref-
erential Clustered Link), which clusters terms based
on the variations described above. The six elemen-
tary variation relations are represented as a di-graph.
Clustering is a two-stage process. First the algorithm
builds connected components using a subset of the
variation relations, usually the modifier relations (L-
Exp, Ins, M-Sub), these are the COMP relations.
The transitive closure COMP* of COMP partitions
the whole set of terms into components. These con-
nected components are sub-graphs of term variants
that share the same headword. At the second stage,
the connected components are clustered into classes
using the head relations (R-Exp, LR-Exp, H-sub),
this subset of relations is called CLAS. At this stage,
components whose terms are in one of the CLAS re-
lations are grouped basing on an edge differentiation
coefficient computed thus:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.708976">
nR(i, j)
�R1

<bodyText confidence="0.999985">
where CLAS is the set of binary head relations
(Exp D, Exp GD, Sub C), and nR(i, j) is the num-
ber of variants of type R between components i and
j. This coefficient is higher when terms of two com-
ponents share many CLAS relations of a rare type
in the corpus. Components with the highest d2j are
clustered first. The CPCL algorithm can be iterated
several times to suit the user&apos;s requirement or un-
til it converges. This means that the user is free to
either set the number of iterations or leave the algo-
rithm to do all the iterations until convergence. The
user only has to specify which set of variations s/he
wants to play the COMP and the CLAS role. In
theory, this distinction is already made in the sys-
tem but the user can change it. On the linguistic

level, a class contains at least two connected com-
ponents, each comprising of sets of term variants
around the same head word. Class here should be
understood in a formal way: it corresponds to group-
ings of connected components resulting from a hier-
archical clustering algorithm. They are not strictly
defined semantically. Although, we find semanti-
cally related terms within these classes, the exact
semantic relations involved between pairs of terms
are not explicitly tagged. So on the semantic level,
a class here comprises subsets of term variants re-
flecting, &amp;quot;class of&amp;quot; relations (engendered by substitu-
tions) and &amp;quot;hypernym/hyponym&amp;quot; relations (engen-
dered by modifier expansions). For instance, Table
1 displays the term variants found in one class.
This class was built around two components, one
structured around the concept of &amp;quot;stickiness mea-
surement&amp;quot; (most frequent repeated segment) and the
other around the concept of &amp;quot;dough stickiness&amp;quot;. We
can observe the COMP relations between term vari-
ants inside each component. The variants that ini-
tiated this class formation are in italics (the ones
sharing CLAS relations).
The TermWatch programs have been implemented
in the AWK language and can run on a Unix or
Windows system. The system is computationally
tractable and processing time is quite acceptable for
real-life applications. For instance, it took 40 sec-
onds on a normal PC running Windows to process a
graph of 3651 term variants and to load the results
onto the Aisee graphic interface. 33 classes of vari-
able sizes were produced at the 3rd iteration of the
clustering algorithm. The smallest class had 4 terms
and the biggest 218 terms! So class size depends very
much on the number and types of variation relations
present in the initial graph.3

5 Combining the two systems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986723625">
The two outlined methodologies use the existence
of syntactic variation between multi-word terms to
structure the terminology as a whole. However, each
approach reflects a different aspect of this structure.
The ExtrAns approach is designed to identify
explicit relations between terms. The results are
(relatively) small synsets and a hierarchy of types.
For TermWatch, the organizing principle results in
larger classes of terms built around different head
words related by syntactic substitution or expansion.
Whilst, not specifically targeting semantic relations
the classes do exhibit related terms. Some of these
relations are definable within the classes. For exam-
ple, the class presented in Table 1 contains all of the
hyponyms of &amp;quot;stickiness&amp;quot; identified in ExtrAns (fig-
ure 2), but the relations are not rendered explicit in
the class. Also the class contains other terms not
involved in a specific hyponymy relation.
The utility of the classes is in capturing more
&amp;quot;fuzzy&amp;quot; relations between terms whilst avoiding the
problems of trying to define the relation. For exam-
ple, how can the relation between t1: &amp;quot;frozen sweet
dough&amp;quot; and t2: &amp;quot;frozen sweet dough baking&amp;quot; be de-
fined ? The most obvious candidate is a part whole
relation but this is defendable only on a formal level:
i.e. t1 is a subset of t2, but does that make t1 really
a part of t2 in any semantic sense? In other words, is
&amp;quot;frozen sweet dough&amp;quot; really a part of &amp;quot;frozen sweet
dough baking&amp;quot;?
The TermWatch system does not grapple with this
issue. The interest of these classes for the QA task is
that they exhibit these fuzzy relations. These repre-
sent wider categories of terms to be used for specific
search types. For example, when looking for gen-
eral information on &amp;quot;frozen sweet dough&amp;quot; a user may
well be interested in &amp;quot;baking&amp;quot; it, but when extract-
ing specific information on the same term the rela-
tion is inappropriate. TermWatch was designed orig-
inally for scientific and technological watch (STW).

Figure 3: Using the structures in ExtrAns

<bodyText confidence="0.999785416666667">
In this type of application, the expert is less inter-
ested in strict semantic relations between terms in
a taxonomy but more in capturing the association
of research topics in his/her field. So such &amp;quot;fuzzy&amp;quot;
relations become all important.
Currently ExtrAns uses the synsets and hyponymy
hierarchy during the `matching&apos; of queries against
documents. However, when this fails to locate any-
thing the process is finished without providing users
with any information or any further access into the
domain. What is required is to &amp;quot;relax&amp;quot; the definition
of semantic relation, or facilitate domain investiga-
tion through visualization of the terminology.
The combination of the two methodologies (de-
picted in figure 3) results in a terminology structured
along four levels of granularity. This structure repre-
sents MWTs that are: Strictly synonymous, Word-
Net related, Hierarchy of types and Clustered by
Class.
These levels can be effectively exploited in lo-
cating answers. First, extract potential answers
that involve strictly synonymous MWTs. Second,
look for potential answers with WordNet related
MWTs. Third, try hypernyms/hyponyms of the
search MWT. Finally, allow the user to browse the
classes of MWTs to identify which are of interest in
answer to the question.
TermWatch allows a user-friendly navigation of
the clustering results. Classes are mapped out as
nodes connected by edges whose length denote the
distance between them. The longer the length, the
farther the classes are from one another and thus the
lower their edge coefficient (d2,). The Aisee inter-
face offers standard navigation functions which allow
users to unfold a class into its components and then
into the terms they contain. It thus reflects the three-
level structuring effected by the TermWatch mod-
ules.
Figure 4 gives the graphic representation of results
obtained on the corpus. Note that only classes linked
to others are shown in this figure. Classes are la-
beled automatically by the most active term. The
layout points out central or core classes, here classes
(32, 22) which can represent the dominant terminol-
ogy, and by extension, core research topics in the
field. This layout also brings out interesting con-
figurations like complete graphs and linear graphs.
Complete graphs. The four classes labeled by the
terms &amp;quot;dough behaviour&amp;quot; (32), &amp;quot;wheat flour bread&amp;quot;
(29), &amp;quot;wheat bran&amp;quot; (6) and &amp;quot;dough improver&amp;quot; (20)
form a complete graph. They are all linked by sym-
metrical head substitution relations. We found in
these classes term variants like &amp;quot;wheat flour dough&amp;quot;
(class 32); &amp;quot;wheat flour bread&amp;quot; (class 29), &amp;quot;wheat
flour supplementation, wheat flour blend, wheat flour
fractionation&amp;quot; (class 6), and finally &amp;quot;wheat flour com-
position&amp;quot; (class 20). This complete graph is thus
structured around the two modifier elements &amp;quot;wheat
flour&amp;quot; which can reflect a property shared by the
concepts of these four classes. Linear graphs. The
anti-symmetrical relations engendered by insertions
and expansions generate linear graphs, i.e., chains of
relatively long vertices starting from a central class to
the border of the graph. The visualization tool natu-
rally aligns the elements of these linear graphs, thus
highlighting them. For instance, the linear graph
formed by the three classes &amp;quot;dough behaviour&amp;quot; (32),
&amp;quot;frozen dough baking&amp;quot; (10), &amp;quot;dough procedure&amp;quot; (21)
is structured around the set of variants: &amp;quot;frozen
sweet dough (32) —3 &amp;quot;frozen sweet dough baking (10)
�— &amp;quot;frozen dough baking&amp;quot; (10). The last term &amp;quot;frozen
dough baking&amp;quot; establishes a strong variation relation
with terms in the third class (21) in which we found
the modifiers &amp;quot;frozen dough&amp;quot; associated to three dif-
ferent head words: &amp;quot;characteristic, method, prod-
uct&amp;quot;.
Given that the syntactic variations which helped
group terms give off semantic links, and given our
restricted definitions of variation relation (see 4.1), a
user seeking information can be offered these class&apos;s
contents at this stage in order to see loosely related
terms semantically which a terminological resource
(thesaurus) or WordNet may not have identified.
For instance, in the class shown in Table 1, many
of the terms may not have been related by any se-
mantic relation in WordNet (bromate measurement
and dough stickiness) because none of the head or
the modifier words are in any synsets. The clus-
tering algorithm, brings these terms in one class
because &amp;quot;bromate measurement&amp;quot; is a modifier sub-
stitution of &amp;quot;stickiness measurement&amp;quot; which is why
they are in the same component. Both tell us some-
thing about &amp;quot;measurement (or rather about measur-
able objects). On the other hand, &amp;quot;dough surface
stickiness measurement&amp;quot;, in the same component, is
a left expansion of &amp;quot;stickiness measurement&amp;quot;. The

two could point to a `hypernym/hyponym&apos; relation.
Thus, from link to link, these terms are connected
to terms of the second component owing to the one
anti-symmetrical link between &amp;quot;dough surface stick-
iness measurement&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;surface stickiness&amp;quot;.
From this kind of investigation, a user can choose
the MWTs of interest. This set then becomes the
basis of a second round of answering specific ques-
tions. In this way the system can provide high preci-
sion access to answers, whilst facilitating navigation
through a domain of unfamiliar MWTs.

The importance of multi-word expressions (MWE)
in various natural language tasks such as auto-
matic indexing, machine translation, information
retrieval/extraction and technology watch need no
longer be proved.
The Multi-word Expression Project aims at study-
ing the properties of a wide range of expressions
including collocations, metaphors and terminology.
The motivation is in explicitly defining the character-
istics of such phrases. The results of the project will
suggest efficient strategies for overcoming the prob-
lems MWEs cause for NLP applications (Sag et al.,
2002)
Much work has been dedicated to the process of
nominal compounding (Levi, 1979) and the seman-
tic interpretation of nominal compounds (Downing,
1977) (Finin, 1980). Other works have addressed
the specific problem of extracting nominal multi-
word expressions for IR applications (Evans et al.,
1992) (Smeaton and Sheridan, 1992) (Smadja, 1993)
or of representing them semantically in order to en-
hance IR systems (Popowich et al., 1992) (Gay and
Croft, 1990).
Many systems are dedicated towards structur-
ing terminology for ontology building or terminol-
ogy knowledge base construction (Aussenac-Gilles
et al., 2003). These approaches use the corpus
to identify linguistic markers which in turn point
to certain semantic relations between terms (hy-
pernym/hyponym, synonyms, meronyms). The ap-
proaches we describe are different in that relations
are gained through syntactic variations between the
terms.
Active research by the computational terminol-
ogy community (Jacquemin, 2001) (Bourigault et
al., 2001) (Pearson, 1998) has highlighted the im-
portance of discourse as a means of capturing the
essence of terms, hence as a good basis for struc-
turing them. Jacquemin&apos;s extensive study has also
highlighted the fact that terms are given to varia-
tions in discourse, so any endeavor to capture the re-
lations between terminological units should integrate
the variation paradigm.

<bodyText confidence="0.999887272727273">
Defining and identifying semantic relations between
terms is problematic but can be utilized as part of the
QA process. However, clustering MWTs based on
syntactic variation uncovers classes of terms which
reflect more &amp;quot;fuzzy&amp;quot; semantic relations. These are
ideally suited to enabling navigation through the do-
main identifying terms to be used in the Question
Answering process, offering sophisticated access to a
domain. The resulting term structure can be utilized
as a computational thesaurus or incorporated as part
of a larger domain ontology.

First, they present an abundance of compounds, secondly they restrict semantic interpretation by excluding compounds with opaque (extra-linguistic) interpretation. The result is multiword terms (MWT) which are both compositional, their formation is a function of their constituent elements (Kageura, 2002) and endocentric, the compound is a hyponym of its head (Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998). &apos;For example, &amp;quot;apple juice place&amp;quot; (Levi, 1979) This paper addresses the issue of structuring the Multi-Word Terms (MWTs) for Question Answering (QA) in technical domains. The central problem is that unfamiliarity with MWTs that characterize such domains creates an effective barrier against users finding answers. Section 2 outlines the domain of focus, the MWT extraction method and examples characteristic MWTs.

However, synonymy identified through WordNet is defined by WordNet. As a general lexical database not designed for specilized domains it represents common synonymy between words. The resulting links created between multi-word terms translates into concepts non-specialists cannot easily distinguish. These links produced 1277 synsets the vast majority of which contain two MWTs. Hyponymy The MWTs are organized into a lexical hyponymy (is a) hierarchy that exploits their endocentricity (Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998). The hyponymy relation is identified through two types of rules, Left Expansions which further modifies &amp;quot;dough stickiness&amp;quot; to be &amp;quot;intense&amp;quot; producing &amp;quot;intense dough stickiness&amp;quot;.

These representations are stored in a Knowledge Base. On-line user queries are subjected to the same linguistic analysis. The resulting semantic representation of the query is `matched&apos; against the knowledge base. These `matches&apos; can be identified in their original document location, so users can contextualize these potential answers. Interest in the specifics of this process should be directed toward (Rinaldi et al., 2002) (Dowdall et al., 2002). In dealing with technical domains we have identified two major obstacles for a QA system which can be summarize as the Parsing Problem and the Paraphrase Problem. The Parsing Problem consists in the increased difficulty of parsing text in a technical domain due to domain-specific sublanguage. Various types of MWT characterize these domains, in particular referring to specific concepts like tools, parts or procedures. These multi word expressions might include lexical items which are either unknown to a generic lexicon (e.g. &amp;quot;acetic acid&amp;quot;) or have a specific meaning unique to this domain.

This stage was performed using the INTEX linguistic parser (Silberztein, 1993). INTEX is a finite state transducer parser. The corpus used in the present study concerns scientific publications on the breadmaking process. It was made available by the French Institute of Scientific Information (INIST). Without going into much detail regarding the candidate term extraction rules, the approach adopted can be summarized as selective NLP followed by shallow parsing, much in the same way as (Evans et al., 1992).

This paper outlines the Question Answering task in such a domain and explores two ways of detecting relations between MultiWord Terms. The first targets specific semantic relations, the second uses a clustering algorithm, but they are both based on the idea of syntactic variation. The paper demonstrates how the combination of these two methodologies provide sophisticated access to technical domains. 1 Introduction Nominal compounds are inherently ambiguous on both the syntactic and semantic fronts. Whilst the number of syntactic possibilities increase exponentially with word length (Isabelle, 1984), semantic interpretation is at best contextually dependent and in the worst cases determined by extra-linguistic (pragmatic) factors.&apos; Technical documentation is an attractive domain in which to explore nominal compounds for two reasons. First, they present an abundance of compounds, secondly they restrict semantic interpretation by excluding compounds with opaque (extra-linguistic) interpretation. The result is multiword terms (MWT) which are both compositional, their formation is a function of their constituent elements (Kageura, 2002) and endocentric, the compound is a hyponym of its head </context>

These representations are stored in a Knowledge Base. On-line user queries are subjected to the same linguistic analysis. The resulting semantic representation of the query is `matched&apos; against the knowledge base. These `matches&apos; can be identified in their original document location, so users can contextualize these potential answers. Interest in the specifics of this process should be directed toward (Rinaldi et al., 2002) (Dowdall et al., 2002). In dealing with technical domains we have identified two major obstacles for a QA system which can be summarize as the Parsing Problem and the Paraphrase Problem. The Parsing Problem consists in the increased difficulty of parsing text in a technical domain due to domain-specific sublanguage. Various types of MWT characterize these domains, in particular referring to specific concepts like tools, parts or procedures. These multi word expressions might include lexical items which are either unknown to a generic lexicon (e.g. &amp;quot;acetic acid&amp;quot;) or have a specific meaning uni</context>

The common ground between these two approaches is in the use of syntactic variants to structure the terminology as a whole. Section 5 explores how the resulting structures can be used in the QA task. After surveying some related work in Section 6 the paper ends by drawing conclusions on the approaches presented. 2 MWT Extraction Before the MWTs can be structured, the terms need to be extracted from a corpus of texts. This stage was performed using the INTEX linguistic parser (Silberztein, 1993). INTEX is a finite state transducer parser. The corpus used in the present study concerns scientific publications on the breadmaking process. It was made available by the French Institute of Scientific Information (INIST). Without going into much detail regarding the candidate term extraction rules, the approach adopted can be summarized as selective NLP followed by shallow parsing, much in the same way as (Evans et al., 1992). We defined morpho-syntactic properties of complex nominal syntagms written as finite state automata, implemented in the INTEX linguistic toolbox. INTEX is equipped wit</context>
