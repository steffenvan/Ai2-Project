The second kind of dictionary helps those users
who have an idea to convey and want to find a
word to designate it. Such dictionaries are ono-
masiological: they connect names to concepts, i.e.
within entries we move from meaning or concept
to name or word.
Sierra (2000) confirmed the well known ob-
servation that the organisation of the world varies
from author to author, by contrasting some rec-
ognized onomasiological dictionaries, such as
Roget&apos;s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases
(1852), Bernstein&apos;s Reverse Dictionary (1975),
and WordNet (Miller et al., 2008).
In order to build a system that maps natural
language descriptions of concepts to the terms
corresponding to those concepts, Sierra and
McNaught (2000) outlined the design of an
Onomasiological Search System. They described
the principles of the system, whereas the archi-
tecture and its components are presented as part
of the design. This also includes an idealised user
interface, with a discussion of the organisation of
the probable terms and additional information
that can help the user to identify precisely the
term he is looking for.
As cognitive issues for the design of such sys-
tem, this paper attempts to present the conceptu-
alisation people engage in, in order to arrive at a
word from its meaning. In this sense, it breaks
the traditional lexicographic assumption that one
should utilise a semasiological approach to pro-
vide formal representations to describe the mean-
ing of a word. In contrast, in the onomasiological
approach, the user can formulate a concept in
several ways and use a variety of words in order
to find a particular word.
Our starting point is to understand what con-
ceptualisation is (section 2), and the process of
designation (section 3). To validate our approach
in practice, section 4 presents the results of an
experiment, which is compared with other stud-

Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998893">
When consulting a dictionary, people can
find the meaning of a word via the defini-
tion, which usually contains the relevant
information to fulfil their requirement.
Lexicographers produce dictionaries and
their work consists in presenting informa-
tion essential for grasping the meaning of
words. However, when people need to
find a word it is likely that they do not
obtain the information they are looking
for. There is a gap between dictionary
definitions and the information being
available in peoples’ mind. This paper at-
tempts to present the conceptualisation
people engage in, in order to arrive at a
word from its meaning. The insights of
an experiment conducted show us the dif-
ferences between the knowledge availa-
ble in peoples’ minds and in dictionary
definitions.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999435">
Many lexicographers recognise users need dic-
tionaries to look for a word that has escaped their
memory although they remember the concept.
From a semantic point of view, Baldinger (1980)
takes user needs into account and thus distin-
guishes dictionaries that serve as aids in encod-
ing from those that help with decoding. The best
known dictionaries of this type allow users to
find the meaning of a word they already know.
Such dictionaries are semasiological: they asso-
ciate meanings with expressions/words, i.e.
within entries we move from word to meaning.

sions are stated.

2 Conceptualisation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998906">
The concept is a mental representation of an
object which is formed in the mind of individuals
through a process of abstraction. We call this
process of constructing an internal representation
of external things a conceptualisation.
Conceptualisation is a mental activity of
grouping the data of common properties
according to external factors, and then concepts
are internalised and form part of each
individual’s knowledge.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.912204">
2.1 Properties
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966882352941">
The terms property, characteristic or feature
have been used for the knowledge necessary to
describe and classify a concept. The
identification of properties is crucial to concept
analysis since it helps to define concepts and
identify their interrelationships.
According to Sager (1990) some properties are
necessary and sufficient to distinguish a concept
from any other, and these properties reflect the
essential characteristics of a concept. Conversely,
other properties are inessential, merely observ-
able in an individual thing, so that they are acci-
dental, may change with time and may not even
be necessarily true in a scientific sense (Petöfi,
1982).
The dichotomy of these two opposing types of
properties has been discussed from a psycholin-
guistic point of view. Aitchison (1994) does not
consider that it is obvious that experts and ordi-
nary people distinguish between essential and
inessential characteristics. Despite the fact that
experts might be able to specify the true nature of
things, they sometimes provide information
which is irrelevant to the mental lexicon. Con-
versely, ordinary people disagree and change
their minds.
As the comparative analysis in section 4
shows, the essential characteristics are not neces-
sarily present in the mental lexicon of a person;
each one describes different properties. Never-
theless, even a description of the inessential
characteristics, given together, provides enough
information to identify the term (Wierzbicka,
1985).
</bodyText>

2.2 Social conceptualisation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905058823529">
People acquire knowledge about things on the
basis of cultural, geographical and social factors.
The environment conditions the conceptualisa-
tion of reality and the use of language. In order to
communicate effectively, people will try to use
language in a similar way to that of the collective
view of the community, in agreement with the
social norm. In fact, because of the social norm,
there is an idealised knowledge structure which
makes it possible to use the same names for the
same things. In the contrary case, when the des-
ignation of a concept is outside that norm, people
assume that the individual&apos;s knowledge is wrong.
However, as we will see in the final analysis, we
must accept that an individual&apos;s knowledge can-
not cover the whole knowledge of the commu-
nity norm.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992304">
2.3 Individual conceptualisation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956652173913">
Reality goes beyond the perception of
individuals. Our knowledge about reality has
increased throughout human history. No one –
human, computer or even the biggest library–
possesses the whole knowledge about reality.
The knowledge structure of things varies from
one person to the other, so that their description
of concepts will be different. As Fugman (1993)
states, since the number of properties is virtually
unlimited, people concentrate on those character-
istics which appear essential, according to their
personal or professional view. As an example, he
points out the different essential properties for
the concept “benzene” given by a physicist, a
biologist, an engineer, a fire-fighter and a chem-
ist.
Even the same person can demonstrate differ-
ent conceptualisations of simple things, such as
&amp;quot;dog&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;apple&amp;quot;, depending on the contextual
situation. For example, a dog seen in different
domains, such as a conference, a zoology lecture,
a road or a house, may be described as canine,
mammal, animal or pet.
</bodyText>

3 Designation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999660833333333">
The process of designation is the opposite of sig-
nification. Signification is the identification of
the meaning of a word, and the result of finding a
meaning is a definition. Designation is the identi-
fication of a term for a concept and the result is a
word.
To retrieve a term, one can use a terminologi-
cal definition, which provides the information
necessary to identify and differentiate a concept
within a system of concepts, so that it sometimes
comprises encyclopaedic information, not usu-
ally necessary in a lexicographic definition.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98286">
3.1 Properties
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983">
Just as a word may have many meanings
(semasiological approach), a concept, which is
described by a set of properties, may be
designated by more than one word
(onomasiological approach). Within the
onomasiological approach, all the properties
together provide the necessary and sufficient
information to identify the concept. However,
since the description of concepts in natural
language does not incorporate all knowledge or
ideas associated with each concept, it can happen
that the projection of a concept, i.e., the query
formulation of the user, will retrieve a set of
terms. For example, the concept “strong winds”,
consisting of two properties, can retrieve, in the
domain of weather terminology, a variety of
terms, such as: “gale”, “tornado”, “hurricane”,
“typhoon”, etc.
The concept a user has in mind when looking
for a target word is expressed by a sentence.
When a person hears this sentence, he translates
each word into his own language and easily iden-
tifies the context. A person may understand the
expression “that which determines air pressure”
and get a mental representation of “that” for
“thing” and then for “instrument”; or that the
speaker might have said “measures” instead of
“determines”. From the context, at the same time,
he may differentiate whether the word “air” re-
fers to the atmosphere or the air of a tyre.
Equally, either the lack or change of any one
property may result in the identification of a dif-
ferent concept. For example, take the following
definition for “barometer”:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.984154">
• A device to measure air pressure.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998652666666667">
Each of the four keywords yields a property.
Then, we can change one property at a time and
get a different concept. If we change

<listItem confidence="0.997713375">
• “Device” to “unit”, the result is the con-
cepts “inch” or “millibar”.
• “Measure” to “provide”, the result is “air
scoop”.
• “Air” to “blood”, the result is “sphyg-
momanometer”.
• “Pressure” to “humidity”, the result is
the concept “hygrometer”.

4 Comparative analysis on conceptuali-
zation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997865">
In order to verify some of the ideas presented
above, an experiment was carried out with a
small group of twenty undergraduate students.
Although a small group is unrepresentative for
any generalisation to be made from a statistical
point of view, it has been sufficient for our pur-
pose to demonstrate that the conceptualisation
used by a random set of students is far from the
definitions found in a dictionary.
From two sets of five words, each student was
asked to take a set and write on a blank sheet of
paper, similar to an onomasiological search, a
concept, a definition or the ideas suggested to
them by each word. After interchanging the
sheets, the other students participating in the ex-
periment wrote the word or words designating
the concepts identified or written on the blank
sheets by the previous student.
The sets of word given contained three general
language words and two terms.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99872225">
• Set A: water, squirrel, bench, euthanasia,
hurricane.
• Set B: lemon, bucket, clothing, monop-
oly, barometer.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999844285714286">
The general words were chosen because they
permit us, as can be observed from the following
sections, to compare the results with the words
analysed by other researchers as well.
We will next introduce our definitions by
comparing with four studies on conceptualisa-
tion.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.978608">
4.1 Putnam
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959086956522">
Putnam (1975) proposes the representation of the
meaning of a word as a finite sequence of at least
four properties:
The syntactic markers, which are the category-
indicators used in a host of contexts to classify
words.
The semantic markers, which are the most
central properties, form part of a widely used
classification system and very may be affected
by any change in the knowledge about the thing.
A description of the features of the stereotype,
which is a conventional idea of what the object
looks like or acts like or is, regardless whether it
is true or not for all the objects. For example,
“yellow” is a stereotype of “gold”, even when
gold is white by nature.
A description of the extension, i.e., the set of
things of which a term is true. The extension is
determined socially depending upon the nature of
the particular things, rather than on the concept
of the individual speaker.
The first three properties belong to the indi-
vidual competence of speakers. The extension

does not necessarily have to be known to every
member of a linguistic community.
According to Petöfi (1982), the semantic
markers and the stereotype may be compared
with Ullman’s concept of meaning. From the
perspective of the lexicographic definition, they
resemble genus and differentia, respectively.
The description of the meaning of “water”, as
a particular natural kind, following these compo-
nents, is given in table 1.

In order to permit comparison of the defini-
tions given in our experiment with his meaning
of “water”, the same four kinds of properties are
used. Our definitions, as shown in Table 2, in-
clude the property “fluid”, which easily can be
classified as a semantic marker.

<bodyText confidence="0.999942272727273">
The properties referring to the boiling and
freezing points of water, given in definitions 7
and 8 in our experiment, may be considered as
part of the concept’s extension, since these prop-
erties depend upon the nature of the water.
Therefore, definitions one to nine include the
semantic marker “liquid”, beside the particular
features of water, the stereotypes, and/or the de-
scription by extension. The definition ten, which
does not include the semantic marker, describes
water by extension.

4.3 Ayto

<bodyText confidence="0.999830736842105">
In order to define the meaning of words, Ayto
(1983) adapts the componential analysis intro-
duced by Pottier to semantic fields. He also iden-
tifies the semantic features that characterise vari-
ous sorts of seats, but analyses these characteris-
tics to compose an analytical definition. The
definition of a word is determined by the seman-
tic features that differentiate it from other words
rather than by the sum of the individual charac-
teristics. The genus for each word in the semantic
field is “seat”, as it presents the only common
characteristic for the rest of the set.
The differentia is determined by comparing
the other characteristics and checking those
which are different. The characteristics are: For
several people, not upholstered, for outdoors,

ple, “a seat for two or more people that has a

4.4 Wierzbicka
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999455">
Wierzbicka (1985) considers that a good lexico-
graphic definition must be exhaustive, i.e., pro-
viding all the properties of the concept. Her view
of a definition differs from an encyclopaedic
definition because the latter conveys knowledge
about the object, while the lexicographic defini-
tion does not include specialised knowledge,
unless it is part of the concept. Her demand for
exhaustiveness is contrary to traditional semasi-
ological lexicography, where, through a genus
and the differentia, the definition provides the
essential properties to identify a concept and dis-
tinguish it from others. However, when there is a
full description, we may be sure that a user will
retrieve the word in an onomasiological search.
Wierzbicka uses five general properties to
reach a definition of animals, e.g. squirrels,
namely: habitat, size, appearance, behaviour and
relation to people. Table 8 presents an example
of a description for each general property.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992818181818">
The distinction between semasiology and ono-
masiology permits us to consider a new perspec-
tive in lexicography. In the semasiological ap-
proach, the perspective is from the dictionary to
the user. Dictionaries are a lexicographer’s prod-
uct and definitions provide the necessary and
sufficient elements in order to know the meaning
of a word.
Conversely, the onomasiological approach is
from the user to the dictionary. The user should
provide the concept, while the dictionary inter-
prets that concept in order to find the most ap-
propriate word. The user can formulate the con-
cept by several methods and may use a variety of
words that in a certain context are similar. Ac-
cording to the user’s social, cultural and geo-
graphical background, the description of the con-
cept may differ in multiple properties.
With regard to the preceding analysis, it is
worthwhile to note that even the most complete
description of a concept can lack &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot;
properties from the point of view of a user. None

That gap should be filled with the aid of a good
onomasiological retrieval system.
This does not mean that it is unlikely that we
shall be able to design a complete and efficient
onomasiological dictionary. In our context, effi-
ciency means that a dictionary has to satisfy the
requirements of a particular kind of user, in a
certain domain of a terminology with a specific
background. Therefore, the design of an onoma-
siological dictionary must first foresee a multi-
plicity of properties for each concept and sec-
ondly the diversity of words that can be used to
name them. Then, the task consists in the accu-
rate interpretation of the description of the con-
cept and providing the word or probable words
the user is looking for.
The core of such onomasiological dictionary,
as reported by Sierra and McNaught (2000), is
the lexical knowledge base (LKB), which should
provide all the necessary knowledge to be ma-
nipulated in order to enable onomasiological
search. In principle, it must represent what a per-
son knows about both concepts and their corre-
sponding terms. Such LKB consists then of a set
of terms, a set of definitions for each term, a set
of keywords associated with the definitions and a
set of lexical paradigms that group keywords
with the same meaning. It not only includes the
databases that constitute these sets of data, but
the interrelationships among all the sets.

<abstract confidence="0.994210253968254">gsierram@ii.unam.mx The second kind of dictionary helps those users who have an idea to convey and want to find a word to designate it. Such dictionaries are onomasiological: they connect names to concepts, i.e. within entries we move from meaning or concept to name or word. Sierra (2000) confirmed the well known observation that the organisation of the world varies from author to author, by contrasting some recognized onomasiological dictionaries, such as Roget&apos;s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases (1852), Bernstein&apos;s Reverse Dictionary (1975), and WordNet (Miller et al., 2008). In order to build a system that maps natural language descriptions of concepts to the terms corresponding to those concepts, Sierra and McNaught (2000) outlined the design of an Onomasiological Search System. They described the principles of the system, whereas the architecture and its components are presented as part of the design. This also includes an idealised user interface, with a discussion of the organisation of the probable terms and additional information that can help the user to identify precisely the term he is looking for. As cognitive issues for the design of such system, this paper attempts to present the conceptualisation people engage in, in order to arrive at a word from its meaning. In this sense, it breaks the traditional lexicographic assumption that one should utilise a semasiological approach to provide formal representations to describe the meaning of a word. In contrast, in the onomasiological approach, the user can formulate a concept in several ways and use a variety of words in order to find a particular word. Our starting point is to understand what conceptualisation is (section 2), and the process of designation (section 3). To validate our approach in practice, section 4 presents the results of an which is compared with other stud- Abstract When consulting a dictionary, people can find the meaning of a word via the definition, which usually contains the relevant information to fulfil their requirement. Lexicographers produce dictionaries and their work consists in presenting information essential for grasping the meaning of words. However, when people need to find a word it is likely that they do not obtain the information they are looking for. There is a gap between dictionary definitions and the information being available in peoples’ mind. This paper attempts to present the conceptualisation people engage in, in order to arrive at a word from its meaning. The insights of an experiment conducted show us the differences between the knowledge available in peoples’ minds and in dictionary definitions.</abstract>
