In this paper, we present a statistical ap-
proach for dialogue act processing in the di-
alogue component of the speech-to-speech
translation system VERBMOBIL. Statistics
in dialogue processing is used to predict
follow-up dialogue acts. As an application
example we show how it supports repair
when unexpected dialogue states occur.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.965501391891892">
Extracting and processing communicative intentions
behind natural language utterances plays an im-
portant role in natural language systems (see e.g.
(Cohen et al., 1990; Hinkelman and Spackman,
1994)). Within the speech-to-speech translation sys-
tem VERBMOBIL (Wahlster, 1993; Kay et al., 1994),
dialogue acts are used as the basis for the treatment
of intentions in dialogues. The representation of in-
tentions in the VERBMOBIL system serves two main
purposes:
• Utilizing the dialogue act of an utterance as
an important knowledge source for transla-
tion yields a faster and often qualitative better
translation than a method that depends on sur-
face expressions only. This is the case especially
in the first application of VERBMOBIL, the on-
demand translation of appointment scheduling
dialogues.
• Another use of dialogue act processing in VERB-
MOBIL is the prediction of follow-up dialogue
acts to narrow down the search space on the
analysis side. For example, dialogue act pre-
dictions are employed to allow for dynamically
adaptable language models in word recognition.
&apos;This work was funded by the German Federal Min-
istry for Education, Research and Technology (BMBF)
in the framework of the Verbmobil Project under Grant
01IV101K/1. The responsibility for the contents of this
study lies with the authors. Thanks to Jan Alexanders-
son for valuable comments and suggestions on earlier
drafts of this paper.
Recent results (e.g. (Niedermair, 1992)) show a
reduction of perplexity in the word recognizer
between 19% and 60% when context dependent
language models are used.
Dialogue act determination in VERBMOBIL is done
in two ways, depending on the system mode: using
deep or shallow processing. These two modes depend
on the fact that VERBMOBIL is only translating on
demand, i.e. when the user&apos;s knowledge of English
is not sufficient to participate in a dialogue. If the
user of VERBMOBIL needs translation, she presses a
button thereby activating deep processing. In depth
processing of an utterance takes place in maximally
50% of the dialogue contributions, namely when the
owner speaks German only. Dialogue act extraction
from a DRS-based semantic representation (Bos et
al., 1994) is only possible in this mode and is the
task of the semantic evaluation component of VERB-
MOBIL.
In the other processing mode the dialogue com-
ponent tries to process the English passages of the
dialogue by using a keyword spotter that tracks the
ongoing dialogue superficially. Since the keyword
spotter only works reliably for a vocabulary of some
ten words, it has to be provided with keywords which
typically occur in utterances of the same dialogue
act type; for every utterance the dialogue component
supplies the keyword spotter with a prediction of the
most likely follow-up dialogue act and the situation-
dependent keywords.
The dialogue component uses a combination of
statistical and knowledge based approaches to pro-
cess dialogue acts and to maintain and to provide
contextual information for the other modules of
VERBMOBIL (Maier and McGlashan, 1994). It in-
cludes a robust dialogue plan recognizing module,
which uses repair techniques to treat unexpected di-
alogue steps. The information acquired during di-
alogue processing is stored in a dialogue memory.
This contextual information is decomposed into the
intentional structure, the referential structure, and
the temporal structure which refers to the dates
mentioned in the dialogue.

emphasis is on statistical dialogue act prediction in
VERBMOBIL, with an evaluation of the method, and

tion and statistical dialogue act prediction.

Predictions of Dialogue Acts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991633802817">
Like previous approaches for modeling task-oriented
dialogues we assume that a dialogue can be de-
scribed by means of a limited but open set of di-
alogue acts (see e.g. (Bilange, 1991), (Mast et al.,
1992)). We selected the dialogue acts by examining
the VERBMOBIL corpus, which consists of transliter-
ated spoken dialogues (German and English) for ap-
pointment scheduling. We examined this corpus for
the occurrence of dialogue acts as proposed by e.g.
(Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969) and for the necessity to
introduce new, sometimes problem-oriented dialogue
acts. We first defined 17 dialogue acts together with
semi-formal rules for their assignment to utterances
(Maier, 1994). After one year of experience with
these acts, the users of dialogue acts in VERBMOBIL
selected them as the domain independent &amp;quot;upper&amp;quot;
concepts within a more elaborate hierarchy that be-
comes more and more propositional and domain de-
pendent towards its leaves (Jekat et al., 1995). Such
a hierarchy is useful e.g. for translation purposes.
Following the assignment rules, which also served-
as starting point for the automatic determination of
dialogue acts within the semantic evaluation com-
ponent, we hand-annotated over 200 dialogues with
dialogue act information to make this information
available for training and test purposes.
Figure 1 shows the domain independent dialogue
acts and the transition networks which define admis-
sible sequences of dialogue acts. In addition to the
dialogue acts in the main dialogue network, there are
five dialogue acts, which we call deviations, that can
occur at any point of the dialogue. They are repre-
sented in an additional subnetwork which is shown
at the bottom of figure 1. The networks serve as
the basis for the implementation of a parser which
determines whether an incoming dialogue act is com-
patible with the dialogue model.
As mentioned in the introduction, it is not only
important to extract the dialogue act of the cur-
rent utterance, but also to predict possible follow
up dialogue acts. Predictions about what comes
next are needed internally in the dialogue compo-
nent and externally by other components in VERB-
MOBIL. An example of the internal use, namely the
treatment of unexpected input by the plan recog-
nizer, is described in section 4. Outside the dialogue
component dialogue act predictions are used e.g. by
the abovementioned semantic evaluation component
and the keyword spotter. The semantic evaluation
component needs predictions when it determines the
dialogue act of a new utterance to narrow down the
set of possibilities. The keyword spotter can only
detect a small number of keywords that are selected
for each dialogue act from the VERBMOBIL corpus of
annotated dialogues using the Keyword Classifica-
tion Tree algorithm (Kuhn, 1993; Mast, 1995).
For the task of dialogue act prediction a knowledge
source like the network model cannot be used since
the average number of predictions in any state of the
main network is five. This number increases when
the five dialogue acts from the subnetwork which can
occur everywhere are considered as well. In that case
the average number of predictions goes up to 10. Be-
-cause the prediction of 10 dialogue acts from a total
number of 17 is not sufficiently restrictive and be-
cause the dialogue network does not represent pref-
erence information for the various dialogue acts we
need a different model which is able to make reliable
dialogue act predictions. Therefore we developed a
statistical method which is described in detail in the
next section.

In order to compute weighted dialogue act predic-

implemented and tested both methods and currently
favor the second one because it is insensitive to de-
viations from the dialogue structure as described by
the dialogue model and generally yields better pre-
diction rates. This second method and its evaluation
will be described in detail in this section.
Currently, we use n-gram dialogue act probabil-
ities to compute the most likely follow-up dialogue
act. The method is adapted from speech recogni-
tion, where language models are commonly used to
reduce the search space when determining a word
that can match a part of the input signal (Jellinek,
1990). It was used for the task of dialogue act pre-
diction by e.g. (Niedermair, 1992) and (Nagata and
Morimoto, 1993). For our purpose, we consider a di-
alogue S as a sequence of utterances Si where each
utterance has a corresponding dialogue act si. If
P(S) is the statistical model of S, the probability
can be approximated by the n-gram probabilities

In all experiments 41 German dialogues (with
2472 dialogue acts) from our corpus are used as
training data, including deviations. TS1 and TS2
use the same 81 German dialogues as test data. The
difference between the two experiments is that in
TS1 only dialogue acts of the main dialogue network
are processed during the test, i.e. the deviation acts
of the test dialogues are not processed. As can be
seen — and as could be expected — the prediction
rate drops heavily when unforseeable deviations oc-
cur. TS3 shows the prediction rates, when all cur-
rently available annotated dialogues (with 7197 dia-
logue acts) from the corpus are processed, including
deviations.

Compared to the data from (Nagata and Mori-
moto, 1993) who report prediction rates of 61.7%,
77.5% and 85.1% for one, two or three predictions
respectively, the predictions are less reliable. How-
ever, their set of dialogue acts (or the equivalents,
called illocutionary force types) does not include di-
alogue acts to handle deviations. Also, since the
dialogues in our corpus are rather unrestricted, they
have a big variation in their structure. Figure 3
shows the variation in prediction rates of three dia-
logue acts for 47 dialogues which were taken at ran-
dom from our corpus. The x-axis represents the dif-
ferent dialogues, while the y-axis gives the hit rate
for three predictions. Good examples for the differ-
ences in the dialogue structure are the dialogue pairs
#15/#16 and #41/#42. The hit rate for dialogue
#15 is about 54% while for #16 it is about 86%.
Even more extreme is the second pair with hit rates
of approximately 93% vs. 53%. While dialogue #41
fits very well in the statistical model acquired from
the training-corpus, dialogue #42 does not. This
figure gives a rather good impression of the wide va-
riety of material the dialogue component has to cope
with.

to be provided to recover from such a state and to
continue processing the dialogue in the best possible
way. The treatment of these cases is the task of the
dialogue plan recognizer of the dialogue component.
The plan recognizer uses a hierarchical depth-first
left-to-right technique for dialogue act processing
(Vilain, 1990). Plan operators have been used to
encode both the dialogue model and methods for re-
covery from erroneous dialogue states. Each plan
operator represents a specific goal which it is able
to fulfill in case specific constraints hold. These
constraints mostly address the context, but they
can also be used to check pragmatic features, like
e.g. whether the dialogue participants know each
other. Also, every plan operator can trigger follow-
up actions. A typical action is, for example, the
update of the dialogue memory. To be able to fulfill
a goal a plan operator can define subgoals which
have to be achieved in a pre-specified order (see e.g.
(Maybury, 1991; Moore, 1994) for comparable ap-
proaches).

<bodyText confidence="0.9993745">
Since the VERBMOBIL system is not actively par-
ticipating in the appointment scheduling task but
only mediating between two dialogue participants it
has to be assumed that every utterance, even if it
is not consistent with the dialogue model, is a legal
dialogue step. The first strategy for error recovery
therefore is based on the hypothesis that the attri-
bution of a dialogue act to a given utterance has
been incorrect or rather that an utterance has vari-
ous facets, i.e. multiple dialogue act interpretations.
Currently, only the most plausible dialogue act is
provided by the semantic evaluation component. To
find out whether there might be an additional inter-
pretation the plan recognizer relies on information
provided by the statistics module. If an incompat-
ible dialogue act is encountered, an alternative dia-
logue act is looked up in the statistical module which
is most likely to come after the preceding dialogue
act and which can be consistently followed by the
current dialogue act, thereby gaining an admissible
dialogue act sequence.
To illustrate this principle we show a part of the
processing of two turns (f mw 1_2 _01 and mps 1_2_02,
see figure 4) from an example dialogue with the di-
alogue act assignments as provided by the seman-
tic evaluation component. The translations stick to
the German words as close as possible and are not
provided by VERBMOBIL. The trace of the dialogue
component is given in figure 5, starting with pro-
cessing of INIT.

In this example the case for statistical repair oc-
curs when a REJECT does not - as expected - follow
a SUGGEST. Instead, it comes after the INIT of the
topic to be negotiated and after a DELIBERATE. The
latter dialogue act can occur at any point of the
dialogue; it refers to utterances which do not con-
tribute to the negotiation as such and which can be
best seen as &amp;quot;thinking aloud&amp;quot;. As first option, the
plan recognizer tries to repair this state using sta-
tistical information, finding a dialogue act which is
able to connect INIT and REJECT&apos;. As can be seen in
figure 5 the dialogue acts REQUEST_COMMENT, DE-
LIBERATE, and SUGGEST can be inserted to achieve
a consistent dialogue. The annotated scores are the
product of the transition probabilities times 1000 be-
tween the previous dialogue act, the potential inser-
tion and the current dialogue act which are provided

by the statistic module. Ordered according to their
scores, these candidates for insertion are tested for
compatibility with either the previous or the current
dialogue act. The notion of compatibility refers to
dialogue acts which have closely related meanings or
which can be easily realized in one utterance.
To find out which dialogue acts can be combined
we examined the corpus for cases where the repair
mechanism proposes an additional reading. Looking
at the sample dialogues we then checked which of the
proposed dialogue acts could actually occur together
in one utterance, thereby gaining a list of admissi-
ble dialogue act combinations. In the VERBMOBIL
corpus we found that dialogue act combinations like
SUGGEST and REJECT can never be attributed to one
utterance, while INIT can often also be interpreted
as a SUGGEST therefore getting a typical follow-up
reaction of either an acceptance or a rejection. The
latter case can be found in our example: INIT gets
an additional reading of SUGGEST.
In cases where no statistical solution is possible
plan-based repair is used. When an unexpected di-
alogue act occurs a plan operator is activated which
distinguishes various types of repair. Depending on
the type of the incoming dialogue act specialized
repair operators are used. The simplest case cov-
ers dialogue acts which can appear at any point of
the dialogue, as e.g. DELIBERATE and clarification
dialogues (CLARIFY_QUERY and CLARIFY_ANSWER).
We handle these dialogue acts by means of repair in
order to make the planning process more efficient:
since these dialogue acts can occur at any point in
the dialogue the plan recognizer in the worst case
has to test for every new utterance whether it is one
of the dialogue acts which indicates a deviation. To
prevent this, the occurrence of one of these dialogue
acts is treated as an unforeseen event which triggers
the repair operator. In figure 5, the plan recognizer
issues a warning after processing the DELIBERATE di-
alogue act, because this act was inserted by means
of a repair operator into the dialogue structure.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974695652174">
This paper presents the method for statistical dia-
logue act prediction currently used in the dialogue
component of VERBMOBIL. It presents plan repair
as one example of its use.
The analysis of the statistical method shows that
the prediction algorithm shows satisfactory results
when deviations from the main dialogue model are
excluded. If dialogue acts for deviations are in-
cluded, the prediction rate drops around 10%. The
analysis of the hit rate shows also a large variation
in the structure of the dialogues from the corpus.
We currently integrate the speaker direction into the
prediction process which results in a gain of up to
5 % in the prediction hit rate. Additionally, we in-
vestigate methods to cluster training dialogues in
classes with a similar structure.
An important application of the statistical predic-
tion is the repair mechanism of the dialogue plan rec-
ognizer. The mechanism proposed here contributes
to the robustness of the whole VERBMOBIL system
insofar as it is able to recognize cases where dialogue
act attribution has delivered incorrect or insufficient
results. This is especially important because the in-
put given to the dialogue component is unreliable
when dialogue act information is computed via the
keyword spotter. Additional dialogue act readings
can be proposed and the dialogue history can be
changed accordingly.
Currently, the dialogue component processes more
than 200 annotated dialogues from the VERBMOBIL
corpus. For each of these dialogues, the plan rec-
ognizer builds a dialogue tree structure, using the
method presented in section 4, even if the dialogue
structure is inconsistent with the dialogue model.
Therefore, our model provides robust techniques for
the processing of even highly unexpected dialogue
contributions.
In a next version of the system it is envisaged that
the semantic evaluation component and the keyword
spotter are able to attribute a set of dialogue acts
with their respective probabilities to an utterance.
Also, the plan operators will be augmented with sta-
tistical information so that the selection of the best
possible follow-up dialogue acts can be retrieved by
using additional information from the plan recog-
nizer itself.

These two modes depend on the fact that VERBMOBIL is only translating on demand, i.e. when the user&apos;s knowledge of English is not sufficient to participate in a dialogue. If the user of VERBMOBIL needs translation, she presses a button thereby activating deep processing. In depth processing of an utterance takes place in maximally 50% of the dialogue contributions, namely when the owner speaks German only. Dialogue act extraction from a DRS-based semantic representation (Bos et al., 1994) is only possible in this mode and is the task of the semantic evaluation component of VERBMOBIL. In the other processing mode the dialogue component tries to process the English passages of the dialogue by using a keyword spotter that tracks the ongoing dialogue superficially. Since the keyword spotter only works reliably for a vocabulary of some ten words, it has to be provided with keywords which typically occur in utterances of the same dialogue act type; for every utterance the dialogue component supplies the keyword spotter with a prediction of the most likely follow-up dialogue act and </context>

Within the speech-to-speech translation system VERBMOBIL (Wahlster, 1993; Kay et al., 1994), dialogue acts are used as the basis for the treatment of intentions in dialogues. The representation of intentions in the VERBMOBIL system serves two main purposes: • Utilizing the dialogue act of an utterance as an important knowledge source for translation yields a faster and often qualitative better translation than a method that depends on surface expressions only. This is the case especially in the first application of VERBMOBIL, the ondemand translation of appointment scheduling dialogues. • A</context>

This second method and its evaluation will be described in detail in this section. Currently, we use n-gram dialogue act probabilities to compute the most likely follow-up dialogue act. The method is adapted from speech recognition, where language models are commonly used to reduce the search space when determining a word that can match a part of the input signal (Jellinek, 1990). It was used for the task of dialogue act prediction by e.g. (Niedermair, 1992) and (Nagata and Morimoto, 1993). For our purpose, we consider a dialogue S as a sequence of utterances Si where each utterance has a corresponding dialogue act si. If P(S) is the statistical model of S, the probability can be approximated by the n-gram probabilities P(S) = H P(Si •• • Si-1) i=1 Therefore, to predict the nth dialogue act sn we can use the previously uttered dialogue acts and determine the most probable dialogue act by computing sn := max P(sisn-i, 8n-2, sn_ 3, ...) 8 To approximate the conditional </context>

Each plan operator represents a specific goal which it is able to fulfill in case specific constraints hold. These constraints mostly address the context, but they can also be used to check pragmatic features, like e.g. whether the dialogue participants know each other. Also, every plan operator can trigger followup actions. A typical action is, for example, the update of the dialogue memory. To be able to fulfill a goal a plan operator can define subgoals which have to be achieved in a pre-specified order (see e.g. (Maybury, 1991; Moore, 1994) for comparable approaches). fmw1_2_01: der Termin den stir neulich abgesprochen haben am zehnten an dem Samstag (MOTIVATE) (the date we recently agreed upon, the 10th that Saturday) da kann ich doch nich&apos; (REJECT) (then I can not) wir sollten einen anderen ausmachen (INIT) (we should make another one) mps1_2_02: wenn ich da so meinen TerminKalender anschaue, (DELIBERATE) (ill look at my diary) das sieht schlecht aus (REJECT).

TS3 shows the prediction rates, when all currently available annotated dialogues (with 7197 dialogue acts) from the corpus are processed, including deviations.

However, their set of dialogue acts (or the equivalents, called illocutionary force types) does not include dialogue acts to handle deviations. Also, since the dialogues in our corpus are rather unrestricted, they have a big variation in their structure.

The responsibility for the contents of this study lies with the authors. Thanks to Jan Alexandersson for valuable comments and suggestions on earlier drafts of this paper. Recent results (e.g. (Niedermair, 1992)) show a reduction of perplexity in the word recognizer between 19% and 60% when context dependent language models are used. Dialogue act determination in VERBMOBIL is done in two ways, depending on the system mode: using deep or shallow processing. These two modes depend on the fact that VERBMOBIL is only translating on demand, i.e. when the user&apos;s knowledge of English is not sufficient to participate in a dialogue. If the user of VERBMOBIL needs translation, she presses a button thereby activating deep processing. In depth processing of an utterance takes place in maximally 50% of the dialog</context>

We selected the dialogue acts by examining the VERBMOBIL corpus, which consists of transliterated spoken dialogues (German and English) for appointment scheduling. We examined this corpus for the occurrence of dialogue acts as proposed by e.g. (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969) and for the necessity to introduce new, sometimes problem-oriented dialogue acts. We first defined 17 dialogue acts together with semi-formal rules for their assignment to utterances (Maier, 1994). After one year of experience with these acts, the users of dialogue acts in VERBMOBIL selected them as the domain independent &amp;quot;upper&amp;quot; concepts within a more elaborate hierarchy that becomes more and more propositional and domain dependent towards its leaves (Jekat et al., 1995). Such a hierarchy is useful e.g. for translation purposes. Following the assignment rules, which also servedas starting po</context>

Statistics in dialogue processing is used to predict follow-up dialogue acts. As an application example we show how it supports repair when unexpected dialogue states occur. 1 Introduction Extracting and processing communicative intentions behind natural language utterances plays an important role in natural language systems (see e.g. (Cohen et al., 1990; Hinkelman and Spackman, 1994)). Within the speech-to-speech translation system VERBMOBIL (Wahlster, 1993; Kay et al., 1994), dialogue acts are used as the basis for the treatment of intentions in dialogues. The representation of intentions in the VERBMOBIL system serves two main purposes: • Utilizing the dialogue act of an utterance as an important knowledge source for translation yields a faster and often qualitative better translation than a method that depends on surface expressions only. This is the case especially in the first application of VERBMOBIL, the ondemand translation of appointment scheduling dialogues. • Another use of dialogue act processing in VERBMOBIL is the prediction of fol</context>
