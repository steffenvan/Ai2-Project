Effective self-organizing techniques for con-
structing monolingual semantic maps of
Japanese and Chinese have already been
developed. By extending the monolin-
gual map to a bilingual semantic map, we
have proposed a semantics-based approach
for word alignment in a Japanese/Chinese
bilingual corpus.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999904321428572">
Acquiring translation knowledge from a bilingual
parallel corpus requires alignment not only at the
sentence level but also at the word level. If a bilin-
gual corpus is aligned at the word level, translation
words that are not in a dictionary, such as those
depending on domain or time, might be obtained,
or, multiple translation candidates might be scored.
Furthermore, translation patterns based on the rela-
tions of words at the phrase or clause level might be
automatically acquired (Brown, 1997). Thus, align-
ment is a very important, fundamental task in natu-
ral language processing (NLP). The research related
to this topic includes a series of statistical mod-
els (e.g., Brown, et al., 1988; Brown, et al., 1993;
Macklovitch and Hanna, 1996), a method using dy-
namic programming (Dagan, 1993), a statistical ap-
proach introducing contextual information (Varea, et
al., 2002), and structure alignment methods (Kaji, et
al., 1992; Matsumoto, et al., 1993; Wu, 1995; Ima-
mura, 2001). All of these approaches, however, are
based on either statistical information or grammati-
cal structure, but not on meaning.
Automatic methods for constructing monoligual
semantic maps of Japanese or Chinese have already
been proposed (Ma, et al., 2002). In a monoligual se-
mantic map, words with similar meanings are placed
at the same or neighboring points, so that the dis-
tance between the points represents the semantic
similarity of the words. If a bilingual semantic
map could be automatically constructed by accept-
ing translation pairs of sentences as inputs, word
alignment would be easily obtained from the map.
Since the bilingual semantic map, like the monolin-
gual semantic map, would provide results with visi-
bility and continuity, it would be easy to handle one-
to-many or many-to-one alignment. Furthermore,
bilingual maps can perhaps be expected to be ap-
plied in foreign language learning or foreign language
writing by using bilingual parallel corpora. The most
important factor is that the translations should usu-
ally be free. There is an evident limitation of existing
alignment methods that rely on statistical or gram-
matical information, which suggests the necessity to
develop an approach based on meaning.
This paper proposes a new method for auto-
matically constructing bilingual semantic maps of
Japanese and Chinese. the method accepts trans-
lation pairs of Japanese and Chinese sentences as
inputs, with the aiming of providing word alignment
based on meaning&apos; . We used the Kyoto University
Japanese corpus and its translated Chinese corpus
to conduct an experiment and confirm the effective-
ness of the proposed method. The necessary training
data for automatically constructing semantic maps
was obtained from eight years of a Japanese newspa-
per, Mainichi Shinbun.

1 Since present semantic maps are constructed basi-
cally on co-occurrent information, the method proposed
is not strictly a semantic approach. However, since our
final goal is to develop true semantic maps, and align-
ment based on meaning itself is a very important idea,
we use the expression &amp;quot;based on meaning&amp;quot;, without fear
of misunderstanding.

<bodyText confidence="0.999919366666667">
As part of the Japanese-Chinese machine translation
project, we are constructing a bilingual parallel cor-
pus based on the Kyoto University Japanese corpus
(Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997). The translation pair
of sentences were obtained from the corpus. Since
the Kyoto University corpus has already been mor-
phologically analyzed, the Japanese sentences were
used directly without any analysis, while the trans-
lated Chinese sentences were segmented and part-
of-speech tagged by using the morphological analy-
sis tool developed by Beijing University (Zhou and
Duan, 1994).
To evaluate the two different languages with the
same measure, the words appearing in a translated
Chinese sentence were given at most five translated
Japanese candidate words, which were used instead
of the original Chinese words. The candidates were
obtained manually2 from two Chinese-Japanese dic-
tionaries: &amp;quot;Han Ri Ci Dian&amp;quot;, published by Jilin Ed-
ucation Publisher, and &amp;quot;Chunichi Daijiten&amp;quot;3 , pub-
lished by Taishukan Publishing Co., Ltd. The can-
didates were selected according to the following or-
der of priority: (1) a word that also appears in the
Japanese original sentence; (2) a word that has the
same POS as the original Chinese word; (3) a word
chosen according to the order listed in the dictionary;
and (4) a word that appears in the Kyoto University
corpus. Thus, all the words in the translated Chinese
sentence in the pair shown above can be rendered in
terms of Japanese candidate words as follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.969262416666667">
In this way, we can express a translation pair of sen-
tences in terms of only Japanese words. As this ex-
ample shows, however, we can recognize translated
Japanese candidate words, such as &amp;quot;La 41, t: &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;La otv that do not exist in the
original Japanese sentence. This means that it is
virtually impossible to perform word alignment by
only using surface representations, even if the trans-
lation pair of sentences has been unified by a single
language.
The actual learning data used in self-organization
were obtained in the following way. Each Japanese

word appearing in a Japanese sentence was defined
in terms of its co-occurrent words (the targeted word
itself and the words to its immediate left and right).
They were obtained from eight years (1991-1998) of
the Japanese newspaper, Mainichi Shinbun, and used
as learning data. Each Chinese word appearing in
a translated Chinese sentence was defined in terms
of the co-occurrent words of its Japanese translation
candidates and the Chinese words defined in this way
were used as learning data. In the next section, we
explicitly describe the construction of the learning
data and the coding method used to transform it
into inputs for the SOM.

of co-occurrent Japanese words, there is no need
to distinguish between Chinese and Japanese, and

Word alignment experiments were performed for ten
translation pairs of sentences. The learning data was
obtained in the way described in Sec. 3.2. Consid-
ering the translation pair of sentences given in Sec.
3.1 as an example, the number of words was N =
m+ n=16+15=31, the total number of co-occurrent
words was 62,627, and the number of different co-
occurrent words was 22,077. Among the 31 words,
the period symbol (&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;)4 had the largest number
of co-occurrent words (4,180), while the word &amp;quot;
t-,&amp;quot; in the Japanese sentence and the comma
in the translated Chinese sentence had the smallest
numbers of co-occurrent words (5 each).

Figure 2 shows the semantic map for word align-
ment of the translation pair given in Sec. 3.1 as
an example. Here, the words tagged with &amp;quot;J&amp;quot; are
Japanese words from the Japanese sentence and the
words with &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; are Chinese words from the trans-
lated Chinese sentence5 . From the map, we could
obtain the word alignment results listed in Table 1
by focusing on each Japanese word and choosing the
closest Chinese word to it&apos; . The correct answers are
also given in the table. From this table, we can see
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.5138435">
that [J:{,c : aitbp : U1,c: [J : C:
MPS],p : , C: Mbp : C P—TR,

C:. ] were aligned correctly. Among these pairs, in
the case of [J: , C:WM] and C: ITTR,
the Japanese word and the Japanese translation can-
didates for the Chinese words have different surface
representations. The other alignment results are in-
correct in the strict sense of the word. Among these
apparent mistakes, however, there are some interest-
ing results. For example, for the Japanese word &amp;quot;J:
MA&amp;quot; , although &amp;quot;C:Wil&amp;quot; was aligned as the closest
Chinese word, the semantic map shows that the sec-
ond closest Chinese word is actually &amp;quot;C:MA&amp;quot;. That
is, if we had included the second closest candidate,
we would have obtained the correct answer. Simi-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.950296428571429">
Because both Japanese and Chinese use Chinese
characters, it is necessary to use such symbols to dis-
tinguish between languages.
6 These results were obtained by only selecting the
Chinese word closest the Japanese word. If the second
closest or third closest words are also used, the word
alignment results can include multiple candidates.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851156862745">
larly, for &amp;quot;J: 1- &apos;y 7°&amp;quot;, its second candidates is &amp;quot;C:
a correct answer. Also, the incorrect alignment
results, [J:La , C:A-M] and [J:, C:. ] were due to
the fact that there are no Chinese words (or at least
none appearing in the sentence) that correspond to
these Japanese words. Another problem was incor-
rect alignment caused by the inconsistency of word
segmentation between the Japanese and Chinese sen-
tence, as in the case of [JAP,:, CARts]. None of
these problems can be resolved by only applying the
word alignment technique.
Table 2 lists the baseline word alignment results,
which were obtained by focusing on each Japanese
word and choosing the Chinese word with the small-
est semantic distance dii which was calculated by
Eq. (8). From this table we can see that [J : *&amp;quot;)
tp, C : MS] was incorrect, while &amp;quot;J : t-,&amp;quot; was
correctly aligned by using the semantic map. Also,
although incorrect results were obtained both for the
semantic map, such as [J:MA, C:Wirl or [J:WE&apos;r5, C:
MA] and for the baseline such as, [J:MA, C:FIVt]
or [J:{#12, C:MS], the results for the semantic map
were somewhat correct in meaning, whereas those for
the baseline were totally wrong. If we see the second
candidates, we can know that the second candidates
of &amp;quot;J:MA&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;J: 1- ,y 7&apos;&amp;quot; are &amp;quot;C:MS&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;CA
&amp;quot; which are incorrect. We can thus say that the
method using the semantic map performed better
than the baseline method.
Figure 3 shows the word-alignment semantic map
obtained by principle component analysis (PCA). By
comparing it with Figure 2, we can see that the re-
sults obtained by PCA would be worse than those ob-
tained by self-organization. For example, the pair [J:
C: WM], which has different surface repre-
sentations, could not be obtained by PCA. &amp;quot;J:
also
also could not be correctly aligned even if the second
closest candidate were included. In addition, words
tend to cluster together in certain areas and the to-
tal disposition of the words is thus imbalanced, which
detracts from the semantic map&apos;s features of visibil-
ity and continuity. We also tried to use hierarchical
clustering for word alignment. The results obtained
were slightly worse than those obtained with the self-
organizing semantic map. For example, [J: *&amp;quot;)
C: ±] also could not be correctly obtained with the
clustering method. Moreover, because we could not
know the semantic distance between words within a
group, we could not easily obtain second closest can-
didates as we could with the semantic map.

This paper has proposed a novel word alignment

If a bilingual corpus is aligned at the word level, translation words that are not in a dictionary, such as those depending on domain or time, might be obtained, or, multiple translation candidates might be scored.

However, since our final goal is to develop true semantic maps, and alignment based on meaning itself is a very important idea, we use the expression &amp;quot;based on meaning&amp;quot;, without fear of misunderstanding. x i 3.2 Learning data As part of the Japanese-Chinese machine translation project, we are constructing a bilingual parallel corpus based on the Kyoto University Japanese corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997). The translation pair of sentences were obtained from the corpus. Since the Kyoto University corpus has already been morphologically analyzed, the Japanese sentences were used directly without any analysis, while the translated Chinese sentences were segmented and partof-speech tagged by using the morphological analysis tool developed by Beijing University (Zhou and Duan, 1994). To evaluate the two different languages with the same measure, the words appearing in a translated Chinese sentence were given at most five translated Japanese candidate words, which were used instead of the original </context>
