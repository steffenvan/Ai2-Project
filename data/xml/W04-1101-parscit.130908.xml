<bodyText confidence="0.9998464">
The comma is the most common form of
punctuation. As such, it may have the
greatest effect on the syntactic analysis of a
sentence. As an isolate language, Chinese
sentences have fewer cues for parsing. The
clues for segmentation of a long Chinese
sentence are even fewer. However, the av-
erage frequency of comma usage in Chi-
nese is higher than other languages. The
comma plays an important role in long
Chinese sentence segmentation. This paper
proposes a method for classifying commas
in Chinese sentences by their context, then
segments a long sentence according to the
classification results. Experimental results
show that accuracy for the comma classifi-
cation reaches 87.1 percent, and with our
segmentation model, our parser&apos;s depend-
ency parsing accuracy improves by 9.6 per-
cent.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999914268292683">
Chinese is a language with less morphology and
no case marker. In Chinese, a subordinate clause or
coordinate clause is sometimes connected without
any conjunctions in a sentence. Because of these
characteristics, Chinese has a rather different set of
salient ambiguities from the perspective of statisti-
cal parsing (Levy and Manning, 2003). In addition,
the work for clause segmentation is also rather dif-
ferent compared with other languages.
However, in written Chinese, the comma is used
more frequently (Lin, 2000). In English, the average
use of comma per sentence is 0.869 (Jones, 1996a)1
—1.04(Hill, 1996), and in Chinese it is 1.792, which
is one and a half to two more times as it is used in
English. In Korean, the comma is used even less
than it is in English (Lin, 2000).
Since Chinese has less morphology and no case
marker, and the comma is frequently used, the
comma becomes an important cue for long Chinese
sentence parsing. Because more commas may ap-
pear in longer sentences, the necessity of analyzing
the comma also increases.
Some handbooks about standard Chinese gram-
mars list ten to twenty uses of the comma, accord-
ing to the context. Among these uses, is occurrence
at the end of a clause3 in a sentence (Lin, 2000).
About 30% of commas are used to separate the
clause from its main sentence or neighbor clause(s).
If the comma appears at the end of a clause, the
position can naturally be set as the clause segmen-
tation point.
This paper proposes Chinese long sentence
segmentation by classifying the comma. In section
2, related work in clause segmentation and punc-
tuation processing is presented. Comma classifica-
tion criteria are then introduced, and the
classification model follows. Afterwards, some
experimental results show how the proposed
comma classification and long sentence segmenta-
tion are effective in Chinese parsing. Finally, a
conclusion will be given.

2 Related Work
2.1 Related Work for Clause Segmenta-
tion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998562">
Syntactic ambiguity problems increase drasti-
cally as the input sentence becomes longer. Long
sentence segmentation is a way to avoid the prob-
lem. Many studies have been made on clause seg-
mentation (Carreras and Marquez, 2002, Leffa, 1998,
Sang and Dejean,2001). In addition, many studies
also have been done on long sentences segmenta-
tion by certain patterns (Kim and Zhang, 2001, Li and
Pei, 1990, Palmer and Hearst, 1997).
However, some researchers merely ignore punc-
tuation, including the comma, and some research-
ers use a comma as one feature to detect the
segmentation point, not fully using the information
from the comma.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.571186">
2.2 Related Work for Punctuation Proc-
essing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985015392857143">
Several researchers have provided descriptive
treatment of the role of punctuations: Jones (1996b)
determined the syntactic function of the punctua-
tion mark. Bayraktar and Akman (1998) classified
commas by means of the syntax-patterns in which
they occur. However, theoretical forays into the
syntactic roles of punctuation were limited.
Many researchers have used the punctuation
mark for syntactic analysis and insist that punctua-
tion indicates useful information. Jones (1994) suc-
cessfully shows that grammar with punctuation
outperforms one without punctuation. Briscoe and
Carroll 1995) also show the importance of punc-
(
tuation in reducing syntactic ambiguity. Collins
(1999), in his statistical parser, treats a comma as an
important feature. Shiuan and Ann (1996) separate
complex sentences with respect to the link word,
including the comma. As a result, their syntactic
parser performs an error reduction of 21.2% in its
accuracy.
Say (1997) provides a detailed introduction to us-
ing punctuation for a variety of other natural lan-
guage processing tasks.
All of these approaches prove that punctuation
analyses improve various natural language process-
ing performance, especially in complex sentence
segmentation.

3 Types of Commas
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973378">
The comma is the most common punctuation,
and the one that might be expected to have the
greatest effect on syntactic parsing. Also, it seems
natural to break a sentence at the comma position
in Chinese sentences. The procedure for syntactic
analysis of a sentence, including the segmentation
part, is as follows:
1st step: segment the sentence at a comma
2nd step: do the dependency analysis for each
segment
3rd step: set the dependency relation between
segment pairs
In Chinese dependency parsing, not all commas
are proper as segmentation points.
First, segmentation at comma in some sentences,
will cause some of the words fail to find their heads.
Figure 2 shows, in example (2), there are two
words, IM (BeiHai City) and V_ (preposition)
from the left segment have dependency relation
with the word A(is) of the right segment. So, the
segmentation at comma , will cause two of words
IM (BeiHai City) and V_ (preposition) in the left
segment, cannot find their head in the second step
of syntactic parsing stage.
Second, segmentation at commas can cause
some words to find the wrong head. Example (3) of
figure 3 shows two pairs of words with dependency
relations. For each pair, one word is from the left
segment, and one word is from the right segment :
IV (like) from the left segment and �X(teacher)
from the right, 4i� (young) from the left and 0
(of) from the right. Segmentation at the comma
will cause the word 4i�(young) to get the word I
V (like) as its head, which is wrong.
Example (2) and (3) demonstrate improper sen-
tence segmentation at commas. In figure 2 and fig-
ure 3, there are two dependency lines that cross
over the commas for both sentences. We call these
kinds of commas mul_dep_lines_cross comma
(multiple lines cross comma). In figure 1, there is
only one dependency line cross over the comma.
We call these kinds of commas one_dep_line_cross
comma.
Segmentation at one_dep_line_cross comma is
helpful for reducing parsing complexity and can
contribute to accurate parsing results. However, we
should avoid segmenting at the position of
mul_dep_lines_cross comma. It is necessary to
check each comma according to its context.

3.1 Delimiter Comma and Separator
Comma
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970937296296296">
Nunberg (1990) classified commas in English
into two categories, as a delimiter comma and a
separator comma, by whether the comma is used to
separate the elements of the same type4 or not.
While a delimiter comma is used to separate differ-
ent syntactic types, a separator comma is used to
separate members of conjoined elements. The
commas in Chinese can also be classified into these
two categories. The commas in example (3) and (4)
are separators, while those in (2) and (5), are
delimiters.
However, both delimiter comma and separator
commas can be mul_dep_line_cross commas. In
example (2), the comma is a delimiter comma as
well as a mul_dep_line_cross comma. As a separa-
tor comma, the comma in example (3), is also a
mul_dep_line_cross comma. Nunberg&apos;s classifica-
tion cannot help to identify mul_dep_line_cross
commas.
We therefore need a different kind of classifica-
tion of comma. Both delimiter comma and separa-
tor comma can occur within a clause or at the end
of a clause. Commas that appear at the end of a
clause are clearly one_dep_line_cross commas.
The segmentation at these kinds of comma is valid.
4 Same type means that it has the same syntactic role in the sentence, it can be a
coordinate phrase or coordinate clause.

<bodyText confidence="0.999952741935484">
A segment is a group of words between two
commas or a group of words from the beginning
(or end) of a sentence to its nearest comma.
To identify whether a comma is an inter-clause
comma or an intra-clause comma, we assign values
to each comma. These values reflect the nature of
the two segments next to the comma. Either the left
or right segment of a comma, can be deduced as a
phrase5, or several non-overlapped phrases, or a
clause.(see examples (6)—(15)). The value we as-
sign to a comma is a two-dimensional value
(left_seg, right_seg). The value of left_seg and
right_seg can be p(hrase) or c(lause), therefore the
assigned value for each comma can be (p,p), (p,c),
(c,p) or (c,c).
Commas with (p,p) as the assigned value, in-
clude the case when the left and right segment of
the comma can be deduced as one phrase, as shown
in example (6) or several non-overlapped phrases,
as described in example (7).
We can assign the value of (c,p) to commas in
example (8), (9) and (10), indicating the left ad-
joining segment is a clause and the right one is a
phrase or several non-overlapped phrases. In a
similar way, commas in example (11)�(13) are
case of (p,c).
If a comma has (c,c) as the assigned value, both
the left segment and the right segment can be de-
duced as a clause. The relation between the two
clauses can be coordinate (example (14)) or subor-
dinate (example (15)).

A word (some words) in the left segment and a
word (some words) in the right segment of a
comma may or may not have a dependency rela-
tion(s). For a comma, if at least one word from the
left segment has a dependency relation with a word
from the right segment, we say the left segment and
the right segment have a syntactic relation. Other-
wise the two segments adjoining the comma have
no syntactic relations. Rel() functions are defined
in table-1.

An inter-clause comma joins the clauses together
to form a sentence. The commas that belong to an

To identify the inter-clause or intra-clause role
of a comma, we need to estimate the right and left
segment conjuncts to the comma, using informa-
tion from both segments. Any information to iden-
tify a segment as a clause or a phrase or phrases is
useful. Carreras and Marquez (2001) prove that
using features containing relevant information
about a clause leads to more efficient clause identi-
fication. Their system outperforms all other sys-
tems in CoNLL&apos;01 clause identification shared task
(Sang &amp; Dejean, 2001). Given this consideration, we
select two categories of features as follows.

To detect whether a segment is a clause or
phrase, the verbs are important. However, Chinese
has no morphological paradigms and a verb takes
various syntactic roles besides the predicate, with-
out any change of its surface form. This means that
information about the verb is not sufficient, in itself,
to determine whether segment is a clause.
When the verb takes other syntactic roles besides
the predicate, it&apos;s frequently accompanied by func-
tion words. For example, a verb can be used as the
complement of the auxiliary word A or 0(Xia,
2000), to modify the following verb or noun. In
these cases, the auxiliary words are helpful for de-
ciding the syntactic role of the verb. Other function
words around the verb also help us to estimate the
syntactic role of the verb. Under this consideration,
we employ all the function words as features,
where they are composed as the indirect relevant
feature category.
Table 4 gives the entire feature set. The label of
each feature type is same as the tag set of Chinese
Penn Treebank 2.0 (see Xia (2000) for more de-
tailed description). If the feature appears at the left
segment, we label it as L_feature type, and if it is
on the right, it&apos;s labeled as R_ feature type, where
feature type is the feature that is shown on table 4.
The value for each feature is either 0 or 1. When
extracting features of a sentence, if any feature in
the table 4, appears in the sentence, we assign the
value as 1 otherwise 0. The features of example (12)
are extracted as table 5 describes. All of these val-
ues are composed as an input feature vector for
comma classification.

5.1 Classification Using SVM

<bodyText confidence="0.999571714285714">
Support vector machines (SVM) are one of the
binary classifiers based on maximum margin strat-
egy introduced by Vapnik (Vapnik, 1995). For many
classification works, SVM outputs a state of the art
performance.
There are two advantages in using SVM for clas-
sification:

tures is possible via various kernel functions.
Because of these characteristics, many research-
ers use SVM for natural language processing and
obtain satisfactory experimental results (Yamada,
2003).
In our experiments, we use SVMlight (Joachims,
1999) as a classification tool.

First, we set the entire left segment and right
segment as an input window. Table 6 gives the per-
formance with different kernel functions. The RBF
kernel function with y =1.5 outputs the best per-
formance. Therefore, in the following experiments,
we use this kernel function only.
Next, we perform several experiments on how
the selection of word window affects performance.
First, we select the adjoining 3 words of the right
and left segment each, indicated as win-3 in table 7.

Second, we select the first 2 words and last 3 words
of the left segment and the first 3 and last 2 of the
right segment, indicated as win 2-3 in table 7. Fi-
nally, we use the part of speech sequence as input.
As the experimental results show, the part of
speech sequence is not a good feature. The features
with clausal relevant information obtain a better
output. We also find that the word window of first
2-last 3 obtains the best total precision, better than
using the entire left and right segments. From this,
we conclude that the words at the beginning and
end of the segment reveal segment clausal informa-
tion more effectively than other words in the seg-
ment.

Shiuan and Ann&apos;s (1996) system obtains the
clues for segmenting a complex sentence in Eng-
lish by disambiguating the link words, including
the comma. The approach to find the segmentation
point by analyzing the specific role of the comma
in the sentence seems similar with our approach.
However, our system differs from theirs as follows:
(1) Shiuan and Ann&apos;s system sieves out just two
roles for the comma, while ours gives an
analysis for the complete usages of the
comma.
(2) Shiuan and Ann&apos;s system also analyzes the
clausal conjunction or subordinating preposi-
tion as the segmentation point.
Although the language for analysis is different,
and the training and testing data also differ, the

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978055555556">
In this paper, we propose a method to segment a
Chinese sentence by classification of the comma.
We define the criteria for classification, and ac-
cording to the criteria, a model for classification of
the comma is given. The segmentation at the
comma position seems to be efficient for improv-
ing the accuracy of dependency parsing by
9.6percent. Moreover, since commas more fre-
quently appear in Chinese language, we expect our
approach including salient and refined analysis of
comma usages provides feasible solutions for seg-
mentation.
However, the accuracy for the segmentation is
not yet satisfactory. Since erroneous segmentation
may cause a parsing failure for the entire sentence,
errors can be serious. Further research should be
done to improve the performance and reduce side
effects for parsing the entire sentence.

<abstract confidence="0.989136238095238">The comma is the most common form of punctuation. As such, it may have the greatest effect on the syntactic analysis of a sentence. As an isolate language, Chinese sentences have fewer cues for parsing. The clues for segmentation of a long Chinese sentence are even fewer. However, the average frequency of comma usage in Chinese is higher than other languages. The comma plays an important role in long Chinese sentence segmentation. This paper proposes a method for classifying commas in Chinese sentences by their context, then segments a long sentence according to the classification results. Experimental results show that accuracy for the comma classification reaches 87.1 percent, and with our segmentation model, our parser&apos;s dependency parsing accuracy improves by 9.6 percent.</abstract>

Experimental results show that accuracy for the comma classification reaches 87.1 percent, and with our segmentation model, our parser&apos;s dependency parsing accuracy improves by 9.6 percent. 1 Introduction Chinese is a language with less morphology and no case marker. In Chinese, a subordinate clause or coordinate clause is sometimes connected without any conjunctions in a sentence. Because of these characteristics, Chinese has a rather different set of salient ambiguities from the perspective of statistical parsing (Levy and Manning, 2003). In addition, the work for clause segmentation is also rather different compared with other languages. However, in written Chinese, the comma is used more frequently (Lin, 2000). In English, the average use of comma per sentence is 0.869 (Jones, 1996a)1 —1.04(Hill, 1996), and in Chinese it is 1.792, which is one and a half to two more times as it is used in English. In Korean, the comma is used even less than it is in English (Lin, 2000).

We call these kinds of commas mul_dep_lines_cross comma (multiple lines cross comma). In figure 1, there is only one dependency line cross over the comma. We call these kinds of commas one_dep_line_cross comma. Segmentation at one_dep_line_cross comma is helpful for reducing parsing complexity and can contribute to accurate parsing results. However, we should avoid segmenting at the position of mul_dep_lines_cross comma. It is necessary to check each comma according to its context. 3.1 Delimiter Comma and Separator Comma Nunberg (1990) classified commas in English into two categories, as a delimiter comma and a separator comma, by whether the comma is used to separate the elements of the same type4 or not. While a delimiter comma is used to separate different syntactic types, a separator comma is used to separate members of conjoined elements. The commas in Chinese can also be classified into these two categories. The commas in example (3) and (4) are separators, while those in (2) and (5), are delimiters. However, both delimiter comma and separator commas can be mul_dep_line_cross commas. In example (2), the comma is a del</context>

Any information to identify a segment as a clause or a phrase or phrases is useful. Carreras and Marquez (2001) prove that using features containing relevant information about a clause leads to more efficient clause identification. Their system outperforms all other systems in CoNLL&apos;01 clause identification shared task (Sang &amp; Dejean, 2001). Given this consideration, we select two categories of features as follows. (1) Direct relevant feature category: predicate and its complements. (2) Indirect relevant feature category: auxiliary words or adverbials or prepositions or clausal conjunctions. Directly relevant features VC: if a copula A appears VA: if an adjective appears VE: if � as the main verb appears VV: if a verb appears CS: if a subordinate conjunction appears Indirectly relevant features AD: if an adverb appears AS: if an aspect marker appears P: if a preposition appears DE: if 0 appears DEV:if it appears DER: if T4 appea</context>

Bayraktar and Akman (1998) classified commas by means of the syntax-patterns in which they occur. However, theoretical forays into the syntactic roles of punctuation were limited. Many researchers have used the punctuation mark for syntactic analysis and insist that punctuation indicates useful information. Jones (1994) successfully shows that grammar with punctuation outperforms one without punctuation. Briscoe and Carroll 1995) also show the importance of punc( tuation in reducing syntactic ambiguity. Collins (1999), in his statistical parser, treats a comma as an important feature. Shiuan and Ann (1996) separate complex sentences with respect to the link word, including the comma. As a result, their syntactic parser performs an error reduction of 21.2% in its accuracy. Say (1997) provides a detailed introduction to using punctuation for a variety of other natural language processing tasks. All of these approaches prove that punctuation analyses improve various natural language processing performance, especially in complex sentence segmentation. 3 Types of Commas The comma is the most common punctuation, and the one that might be expected to have the greatest effect on syntactic parsing.

However, Chinese has no morphological paradigms and a verb takes various syntactic roles besides the predicate, without any change of its surface form. This means that information about the verb is not sufficient, in itself, to determine whether segment is a clause. When the verb takes other syntactic roles besides the predicate, it&apos;s frequently accompanied by function words. For example, a verb can be used as the complement of the auxiliary word A or 0(Xia, 2000), to modify the following verb or noun. In these cases, the auxiliary words are helpful for deciding the syntactic role of the verb. Other function words around the verb also help us to estimate the syntactic role of the verb. Under this consideration, we employ all the function words as features, where they are composed as the indirect relevant feature category. Table 4 gives the entire feature set. The label of each feature type is same as the tag set of Chinese Penn Treebank 2.0 (see Xia (2000) for more detailed description). If the feature appears at the left segment, we label it as L_feat</context>
