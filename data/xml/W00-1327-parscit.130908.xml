Research into the automatic acquisition of
subcategorization frames from corpora is
starting to produce large-scale computational
lexicons which include valuable frequency in-
formation. However, the accuracy of the
resulting lexicons shows room for improve-
ment.. One source of error lies in the lack
of accurate back-off estimates for subcatego-
rization frames, delimiting the performance
of statistical techniques frequently employed
in verbal acquisition. In this paper, we
propose a method of obtaining more accu-
rate, semantically motivated back-off esti-
mates, demonstrate how these estimates can
be used to improve the learning of subcatego-
rization frames, and discuss using the method
to benefit large-scale lexical acquisition.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9998624">
Manual development of large subcategorised
lexicons has proved difficult because pred-
icates change behaviour between sublan-
guages, domains and over time. Yet parsers
depend crucially on such information, and
probabilistic parsers would greatly benefit
from accurate information concerning the rel-
ative frequency of different subcategorization
frames (scFs) for a given predicate.
Over the past years acquiring subcatego-
rization dictionaries from textual corpora has
become increasingly popular (e.g. Brent,
1991, 1993; Ushioda et al., 1993; Briscoe and
Carroll, 1997; Manning, 1993; Carroll and
Rooth 1998; Gahl, 1998; Lapata, 1999, Sarkar
and Zeman, 2000). The different approaches
vary according to the methods used and the
number of scFs being extracted. Regardless
of this, there is a ceiling on the performance
of these systems at around 80% token recall&apos;.

<bodyText confidence="0.999873465116279">
One significant source of error lies in the
statistical filtering methods frequently used
to remove noise from automatically acquired
scFs. These methods are reported to be par-
ticularly unreliable for low frequency scFs
(Brent, 1991, 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997;
Manning, 1993; Manning and Schiltze, 1999;
Korhonen, Gorrell and McCarthy, 2000), re-
sulting in a poor overall performance.
According to Korhonen, Gorrell and Mc-
Carthy (2000), the poor performance of sta-
tistical filtering can be largely explained by
the zipfian nature of the data, coupled with
the fact that many statistical tests are based
on the assumption of two zipfian distributions
correlating: the conditional SCF distribution
of an individual verb (p(scfilverbi)) and the
unconditional SCF distribution of all verbs in
general (p(scfi)). Contrary to this assump-
tion, however, there is no significant correla-
tion between the two distributions.
Korhonen, Gorrell and McCarthy (2000)
have showed that a simple method of filtering
scFs on the basis of their relative frequency
performs more accurately than statistical fil-
tering. This method sensitive to the sparse
data problem is best integrated with smooth-
ing. Yet the performance of the sophisticated
smoothing techniques which back-off to an un-
conditional distribution also suffer from the
lack of correlation between p(scfilverbi) and
p(scfi).
In this paper, we propose a method for ob-
taining more accurate back-off estimates for
SCF acquisition. Taking Levin&apos;s verb classifi-
cation (Levin, 1993) as a starting point, we
show that in terms of SCF distributions, in-
dividual verbs correlate better with other se-
mantically similar verbs than with all verbs
in general. On the basis of this observation,
we propose classifying verbs according to their
semantic class and using the conditional SCF
distributions of a few other members in the

same class as back-off estimates of the class
(p(sc filsemantic class3)).
Adopting the SCF acquisition system of
Briscoe and Carroll (1997) we report an ex-
periment which demonstrates how these esti-
mates can be used in filtering. This is done
by acquiring the conditional SCF distributions
for selected test verbs, smoothing these dis-
tributions with the unconditional distribution
of the respective verb class, and applying a
simple method for filtering the resulting set
of scFs. Our results show that the proposed
method improves the acquisition of SCFS sig-
nificantly. We discuss how this method can be
used to benefit large-scale SCF acquisition.
We begin by reporting our findings that the
SCF distributions of semantically similar verbs
correlate well (section 2). We then introduce
the method we adopted for constructing the
back-off estimates for the data used in our ex-
periment (section 3.1), summarise the main
features of the SCF acquisition approach (sec-
tion 3.2), and describe the smoothing tech-
niques adopted (section 3.3). Finally, we re-
view the empirical evaluation (section 4) and
discuss directions for future work (section 5).

2 Examining SCF Correlation
between Semantically Similar
Verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982736842106">
To examine the degree of SCF correlation
between semantically similar verbs, we took
Levin&apos;s verb classification (1993) as a start-
ing point. Levin verb classes are based on
the ability of a verb to occur in specific
diathesis alternations, i.e. specific pairs of
syntactic frames which are assumed to be
meaning preserving. The classification pro-
vides semantically-motivated sets of syntactic
frames associated with individual classes.
While Levin&apos;s shows that there is corre-
lation between the SCFS related to the verb
sense, our aim is to examine whether there is
also correlation between the scFs specific to
the verb form. Unlike Levin, we are concerned
with polysemic SCF distributions involving all
senses of verbs. In addition, we are not only
interested in the degree of correlation between
sets of SCFS, but also in comparing the rank-
ing of SCFS between distributions. Neverthe-
less, Levin classes provide us a useful starting
point.
Focusing on five broad Levin classes -
change of possession, assessment, killing, mo-
tion, and destroy verbs - we chose four test
verbs from each class and examined the de-
gree with which the SCF distribution for these
verbs correlates with the SCF distributions for
two other verbs from the same Levin class.
The latter verbs were chosen so that one of
the verbs is a synonym, and the other a hyper-
nym, of a test verb. We used WordNet (Miller
et al., 1990) for defining and recognising these
semantic relations. We defined a hypernym
as a test verb&apos;s hypernym in WordNet, and a
synonym as a verb which, in WordNet, shares
this same hypernym with a test verb. We also
examined how well the SCF distribution for
the different test verbs correlates with the SCF
distribution of all English verbs in general and
with that of a semantically different verb (i.e.
a verb belonging to a different Levin class).
We used two methods for obtaining the
SCF distributions. The first was to acquire
an unfiltered subcategorization lexicon for 20
million words of the British National Corpus
(BNc) (Leech, 1992) data using Briscoe and
Carroll&apos;s (1997) system (introduced in sec-
tion 3.2). This gives us the observed distribu-
tion of SCFS for individual verbs and that for
all verbs in the BNC data. The second method
was to manually analyse around 300 occur-
rences of each test verb in the BNC data. This
gives us an estimate of the correct SCF distri-
butions for the individual verbs. The estimate
for the correct distribution of scFs over all
English verbs was obtained by extracting the
number of verbs which are members of each
SCF class in the ANLT dictionary (Boguraev et
al., 1987).
The degree of correlation was examined by
calculating the Kullback-Leibler distance (RL)
(Cover and Thomas, 1991) and the Spearman
rank correlation coefficient (Rc) (Spearman,
1904) between the different distributions2.
The results given in tables 1 and 2 were ob-
tained by correlating the observed SCF distri-
butions from the BNC data. Table 1 shows
an example of correlating the SCF distribu-
tion of the motion verb fly against that of (i)
its hypernym move, (ii) synonym sail, (iii) all
verbs in general, and (iv) agree, which is not
related semantically. The results show that
the SCF distribution for fly clearly correlates
better with the SCF distribution for move and
sail than that for all verbs and agree. The av-

erage results for all test verbs given in table 2
indicate that the degree of SCF correlation is
the best with semantically similar verbs. Hy-
pernym and synonym relations are nearly as
good, the majority of verbs showing slightly
better SCF correlation with hypernyms. The
SCF correlation between individual verbs, and
verbs in general, is poor, but still better than
with semantically unrelated verbs.
These findings with the observed SCF dis-
tributions hold as well with the correct SCF
distributions, as seen in table 3. The results
show that in terms of SCF distributions, verbs
in all classes examined correlate better with
their hypernym verbs than with all verbs in
general.
As one might expect, the polysemy of the
individual verbs affects the degree of SCF cor-
relation between semantically similar verbs.
The degree of SCF correlation is higher with
those verbs whose predominant&apos; sense is in-
volved with the Levin class examined. For
example, the SCF distribution for the killing
verb murder correlates better with that for
the verb kill than that for the verb execute,
whose predominant sense is not involved with
killing verbs.
These results show that the verb sense spe-
cific SCF correlation observed by Levin ex-
tends to the verb form specific SCF correlation
and applies to the ranking of scFs as well.
This suggests that we can obtain more accu-
rate back-off estimates for verbal acquisition
by basing them on a semantic verb type. To
find out whether such semantically motivated

estimates can be used to improve SCF acqui-
sition, we performed an experiment which we
describe below.

3.1 Back-off Estimates for the Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993148148148">
The test data consisted of a total of 60 verbs
from 12 broad Levin classes, listed in table 4.
Two of the examined Levin classes were col-
lapsed together with another similar Levin
class, making the total number of test classes
10. The verbs were chosen at random, sub-
ject to the constraint that they occurred fre-
quently enough in corpus data4 and when ap-
plicable, represented different sub-classes of
each examined Levin class. To reduce the
problem of polysemy, we required that the
predominant sense of each verb corresponds to
the Levin class in question. This was ensured
by manually verifying that the most frequent
sense of a verb in WordNet corresponds to the
sense involved in the particular Levin class.
To obtain the back-off estimates, we chose
4-5 representative verbs from each verb class
and obtained correct SCF distributions for
these verbs by manually analysing around 300
occurrences of each verb in the BNC data. We
merged the resulting set of SCF distributions
to construct the unconditional SCF distribu-
tion for the verb class. This approach was
taken to minimise the sparse data problem
and cover SCF variations within verb classes
and due to polysemy. The back-off estimates

3.2 Framework for SCF Acquisition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998656692307692">
Briscoe and Carroll&apos;s (1997) verbal acquisition
system distinguishes 163 SCFS and returns rel-
ative frequencies for each SCF found for a given
predicate. The scFs are a superset of classes
found in the ANLT and COMLEX (Grishman
et a/., 1994) dictionaries. They incorporate
information about control of predicative ar-
guments, as well as alternations such as ex-
traposition and particle movement. The sys-
tem employs a shallow parser to obtain the
subcategorization information. Potential SCF
entries are filtered before the final SCF lexi-
con is produced. While Briscoe and Carroll
(1997) used a statistical filter based on bi-
nomial hypothesis test, we adopted another
method, where the conditional SCF distribu-
tion from the system is smoothed before fil-
tering the SCFS, using the different techniques
introduced in section 3.3. After smoothing,
filtering is performed by applying a threshold
to the resulting set of probability estimates.
We used training data to find an optimal av-
erage threshold for each verb class examined.
This filtering method allows us to examine
the benefits of smoothing without introducing
problems based on the statistical filter.

3.3.2 Katz Backing-off
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998582">
In Katz backing-off (Katz, 1987), some of the
probability space is given to the scFs unseen
or of low frequency in the conditional distri-
bution. This is done by backing-off to an un-
conditional distribution. Let p(X) be a prob-
ability of a SCF in the conditional distribution,
and p(xâ€žp) its probability in the unconditional
distribution, obtained by maximum likelihood
estimation. The estimated probability of the
SCF is calculated as follows:

<equation confidence="0.9992885">
(1 â€” d) x p(X) i fc(x,i) &gt;
X p(xâ€žp) otherwise
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999942916666667">
The cut off frequency c1 is an empiri-
cally defined threshold determining whether
to back-off or not. When counts are lower
than c1 they are held too low to give an accu-
rate estimate, and we back-off to an uncondi-
tional distribution. In this case, we discount
p(x,) a certain amount to reserve some of the
probablity space for unseen and very low fre-
quency scFs. The discount (d) is defined em-
pirically, and a is a normalization constant
which ensures that the probabilities of the re-
sulting distribution sum to 1.

While Katz backing-off consults different es-

simple task of combining a conditional distri-

<bodyText confidence="0.998472948717949">
To evaluate the approach, we took a sample of
20 million words of the BNC and extracted all
sentences containing an occurrence of one of
the 60 test verbs on average of 3000 citations
of each. The sentences containing these verbs
were processed by the SCF acquisition system,
and the smoothing methods were applied be-
fore filtering. We also obtained results for a
baseline without any smoothing.
The results were evaluated against a man-
ual analysis of the corpus data. This was
obtained by analysing up to a maximum of
300 occurrences for each test verb in BNC
or Los (Garside et al., 1987), Susanne and
SEC (Taylor and Knowles, 1988) corpora. We
calculated type precision (percentage of scFs
acquired which were also exemplified in the
manual analysis) and recall (percentage of the
scFs exemplified in the manual analysis which
were also acquired automatically), and com-
bined them into a single measure of overall
performance using the F measure (Manning
and Schiitze, 1999).

ranking that occur in the same order in the
ranking from the manual analysis. This gives
us an estimate of the accuracy of the relative
frequencies of SCFS output by the system. In
addition to the system results, we also calcu-
lated KL and RC between the acquired unfil-

that both precision and recall show clear im-
provement over the baseline results demon-
strates that linear interpolation can be suc-
cessfully combined with the filtering method
employed. These results seem to suggest that
a smoothing method which affects both the
highly ranked scFs and scFs of low frequency
is profitable for this task.
In this experiment, the semantically moti-
vated back-off estimates helped to reduce the
sparse data problem significantly. While a to-
tal of 151 correct scFs were missing in the test
data, only three were missing after smoothing
with Katz backing-off or linear interpolation.
For comparison, we re-run these experi-
ments using the general SCF distribution of
all verbs as back-off estimates for smooth-
ing6. The average results for the 60 test verbs
given in table 6 show that when using these
estimates, we obtain worse results than with
the baseline method. This demonstrates that
while such estimates provide an easy solution
to the sparse data problem, they can actually
degrade the accuracy of verbal acquisition.
Table 7 displays individual results for the
different verb classes. It lists the results ob-
tained with la and RC using the baseline
method and linear interpolation with semanti-
cally motivated estimates. Examining the re-
sults obtained with linear interpolation allows
us to consider the accuracy of the back-off es-

timates for each verb class. Out of ten verb
classes, eight show improvement with linear
interpolation, with both KL and RC. However,
two verb classes - aspectual verbs, and verbs
of appearance, disappearance and occurrence
- show worse results when linear interpolation
is used.
According to Levin (1993), these two verb
classes need further classification before a full
semantic account can be made. The prob-
lem with aspectual verbs is that the class
contains verbs taking sentential complements.
As Levin does not classify verbs on basis
of their sentential complement-taking proper-
ties, more classification work is required be-
fore we can obtain accurate SCF estimates for
this type of verb.
The problem with verbs of appearance is
more specific to the verb class. Levin remarks
that the definition of appearance verbs may
be too loose. In addition, there are signifi-
cant syntactic differences between the verbs
belonging to the different sub-classes.
This suggests that we should examine the
degree of SCF correlation between verbs from
different sub-classes before deciding on the fi-
nal (sub-)class for which we obtain the es-
timates. As the results with the combined
Levin classes show, estimates can also be suc-
cessfully built using verbs from different Levin
classes, provided that the classes are similar
enough.

In this paper, we have shown that the verb
form specific SCF distributions of semantically
similar verbs correlate well. On the basis
of this observation, we have proposed using
verb class specific back-off estimates in SCF
acquisition. Employing the SCF acquisition
framework of Briscoe and Carroll (1997), we
have demonstrated that these estimates can
be used to improve SCF acquisition signifi-
cantly, when combined with smoothing and
a simple filtering method.
We have not yet explored the possibility
of using the semantically motivated estimates
with statistical filtering. In principle, this
should help to improve the performance of the
statistical methods which make use of back-off
estimates. If filtering based on relative fre-
quencies still achieves better results, it would
be worth investigating ways of handling the
low frequency data for integration with this
method. As Korhonen, Gorrell and McCarthy
(2000) discuss, any statistical filtering method
would work better at low frequences than the
one applied, since this simply disregards all
low frequency SCFS.
In addition to refining the filtering method,
our future work will focus on integrating
this approach with large-scale SCF acquisition.
This will involve (i) defining the set of seman-
tic verb classes across the lexicon, (ii) obtain-
ing back-off estimates for each verb class, and
(iii) implementing a method capable of auto-
matically classifying verbs to semantic classes.
The latter can be done by linking the Word-
Net synonym sets with semantic classes, using
a similar method to that employed by Dorr
(1997). With the research reported, verbs
were classified to semantic classes according
to their most frequent sense. While this ap-
proach proved satisfactory, our future work
will include investigating ways of addressing
the problem of polysemy better.
The manual effort needed for obtaining the
back-off estimates was quite high for this pre-
liminary experiment. However, our recent in-
vestigation shows that the total number of se-
mantic classes across the whole lexicon is un-
likely to exceed 50. This is because many of
the Levin classes have proved similar enough
in terms of SCF distributions that they can be
combined together. Therefore the additional
effort required to carry out the proposed work
seems justified, given the accuracy- enhance-
ment reported.

However, the accuracy of the resulting lexicons shows room for improvement.. One source of error lies in the lack of accurate back-off estimates for subcategorization frames, delimiting the performance of statistical techniques frequently employed in verbal acquisition.

The second method was to manually analyse around 300 occurrences of each test verb in the BNC data. This gives us an estimate of the correct SCF distributions for the individual verbs. The estimate for the correct distribution of scFs over all English verbs was obtained by extracting the number of verbs which are members of each SCF class in the ANLT dictionary (Boguraev et al., 1987). The degree of correlation was examined by calculating the Kullback-Leibler distance (RL) (Cover and Thomas, 1991) and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (Rc) (Spearman, 1904) between the different distributions2.

Taking Levin&apos;s verb classification (Levin, 1993) as a starting point, we show that in terms of SCF distributions, individual verbs correlate better with other semantically similar verbs than with all verbs in general. On the basis of this observation, we propose classifying verbs according to their semantic class and using the conditional SCF distributions of a few other members in the 216 same class as back-off estimates of the class (p(sc filsemantic class3)). Adopting the SCF acquisition system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997) we report an experiment which demonstrates how these estimates can be used in filtering. This is done by acquiring the conditional SCF distributions for selected test verbs, smoothing these distributions with the unconditional distribution of the respective verb class, and applying a simple method for filtering the resulting set of scFs. Our results show that the proposed method improves the acquisition of SCFS significantly. We discuss how this method can be used to benefit large-scale SCF acquisition.

The scFs are a superset of classes found in the ANLT and COMLEX (Grishman et a/., 1994) dictionaries. They incorporate information about control of predicative arguments, as well as alternations such as extraposition and particle movement. The system employs a shallow parser to obtain the subcategorization information. Potential SCF entries are filtered before the final SCF lexicon is produced. While Briscoe and Carroll (1997) used a statistical filter based on binomial hypothesis test, we adopted another method, where the conditional SCF distribution from the system is smoothed before filtering the SCFS, using the different techniques introduced in section 3.3. After smoothing, filtering is performed by applying a threshold to the resulting set of probability estimates. We used training data to find an optimal average threshold for each verb class examined. This filtering method allows us to examine the benefits of smoothing without introducing problems based on the statistical filter. 3.3 Smoothing 3.3.1 Add One </context>

This was obtained by analysing up to a maximum of 300 occurrences for each test verb in BNC or Los (Garside et al., 1987), Susanne and SEC (Taylor and Knowles, 1988) corpora. We calculated type precision (percentage of scFs acquired which were also exemplified in the manual analysis) and recall (percentage of the scFs exemplified in the manual analysis which were also acquired automatically), and combined them into a single measure of overall performance using the F measure (Manning and Schiitze, 1999).

We defined a hypernym as a test verb&apos;s hypernym in WordNet, and a synonym as a verb which, in WordNet, shares this same hypernym with a test verb. We also examined how well the SCF distribution for the different test verbs correlates with the SCF distribution of all English verbs in general and with that of a semantically different verb (i.e. a verb belonging to a different Levin class). We used two methods for obtaining the SCF distributions. The first was to acquire an unfiltered subcategorization lexicon for 20 million words of the British National Corpus (BNc) (Leech, 1992) data using Briscoe and Carroll&apos;s (1997) system (introduced in section 3.2). This gives us the observed distribution of SCFS for individual verbs and that for all verbs in the BNC data. The second method was to manually analyse around 300 occurrences of each test verb in the BNC data. This gives us an estimate of the correct SCF distributions for the individual verbs. The estimate for the correct distribution of scFs over all English verbs was obtained by extracting the number of verbs which are members of each SCF class in the ANLT dictionary (Boguraev et al., 1987).

Korhonen, Gorrell and McCarthy (2000) have showed that a simple method of filtering scFs on the basis of their relative frequency performs more accurately than statistical filtering. This method sensitive to the sparse data problem is best integrated with smoothing. Yet the performance of the sophisticated smoothing techniques which back-off to an unconditional distribution also suffer from the lack of correlation between p(scfilverbi) and p(scfi). In this paper, we propose a method for obtaining more accurate back-off estimates for SCF acquisition. Taking Levin&apos;s verb classification (Levin, 1993) as a starting point, we show that in terms of SCF distributions, individual verbs correlate better with other semantically similar verbs than with all verbs in general. On the basis of this observation, we propose classifying verbs according to their semantic class and using the conditional SCF distributions of a few other members in the 216 same class as back-off estimates of the class (p(sc filsemantic class3)). Adopting the SCF acquisition system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997) we report an experiment which demonstrates how these estimates can be used in filtering. This is done by acquiring </context>

See section 2 for details. timates for each verb class. Out of ten verb classes, eight show improvement with linear interpolation, with both KL and RC. However, two verb classes - aspectual verbs, and verbs of appearance, disappearance and occurrence - show worse results when linear interpolation is used. According to Levin (1993), these two verb classes need further classification before a full semantic account can be made. The problem with aspectual verbs is that the class contains verbs taking sentential complements. As Levin does not classify verbs on basis of their sentential complement-taking properties, more classification work is required before we can obtain accurate SCF estimates for this type of verb. The problem with verbs of appearance is more specific to the verb class. Levin remarks that the definition of appearance verbs may be too loose. In addition, there are significant syntactic differences between </context>
