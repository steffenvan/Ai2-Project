<bodyText confidence="0.999664692307692">
This article presents the experiments carried
out at Jadavpur University as part of the
participation in Multi-Way Classification of
Semantic Relations between Pairs of Nomi-
nals in the SemEval 2010 exercise. Separate
rules for each type of the relations are iden-
tified in the baseline model based on the
verbs and prepositions present in the seg-
ment between each pair of nominals. Inclu-
sion of WordNet features associated with
the paired nominals play an important role
in distinguishing the relations from each
other. The Conditional Random Field (CRF)
based machine-learning framework is
adopted for classifying the pair of nominals.
Application of dependency relations,
Named Entities (NE) and various types of
WordNet features along with several com-
binations of these features help to improve
the performance of the system. Error analy-
sis suggests that the performance can be im-
proved by applying suitable strategies to
differentiate each paired nominal in an al-
ready identified relation. Evaluation result
gives an overall macro-averaged F1 score of
52.16%.

<bodyText confidence="0.999408960784314">
Semantic Relations describe the relations between
concepts or meanings that are crucial but hard to
identify. The present shared task aims to develop
the systems for automatically recognizing semantic
relations between pairs of nominals. Nine relations
such as Cause-Effect, Instrument-Agency, Product-
Producer, Content-Container, Entity-Origin, En-
tity-Destination, Component-Whole, Member-
Collection and Message-Topic are given for Se-
mEval-2010 Task #8 (Hendrix et al., 2010). The
relation that does not belong to any of the nine re-
lations is tagged as Other. The first five relations
also featured in the previous SemEval-2007 Task
#4.
The present paper describes the approach of
identifying semantic relations between pair of
nominals. The baseline system is developed based
on the verbs and prepositions present in the senten-
tial segment between the two nominals. Some
WordNet (Miller, 1990) features are also used in
the baseline for extracting the relation specific at-
tributes (e.g. Content type hypernym feature used
for extracting the relation of Content-Container).
The performance of the baseline system is limited
due to the consideration of only the verb and
preposition words in between the two nominals
along with a small set of WordNet features. Hence,
the Conditional Random Field (CRF) (McCallum
et al., 2001) based framework is considered to ac-
complish the present task. The incorporation of
different lexical features (e.g. WordNet hyponyms,
Common-parents, distance), Named Entities (NE)
and syntactic features (direct or transitive depend-
ency relations of parsing) has noticeably improved
the performance of the system. It is observed that
nominalization feature plays an effective role for
identifying as well as distinguishing the relations.
The test set containing 2717 sentences is evaluated
against four different training sets. Some of the
relations, e.g. Cause-Effect, Member-Collection
perform well in comparison to other relations in all
the four test results. Reviewing of the confusion
matrices suggests that the system performance can
be improved by reducing the errors that occur in
distinguishing the two individual nominals in each
relation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
The pre-processing of resources and the baseline
system are described in Section 2 and Section 3
respectively. Development of CRF-based model is
discussed in Section 4. Experimental results along

The annotated training corpus containing 8000 sen-
tences was made available by the respective task
organizers. The objective is to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of the system in terms of identifying se-
mantic relations between pair of nominals. The
rule-based baseline system is evaluated against the
whole training corpus. But, for in-house experi-
ments regarding CRF based framework, the devel-
opment data is prepared by randomly selecting 500
sentences from the 8000 training sentences. Rest
7500 sentences are used for training of the CRF-
model. The format of one example entry in training
file is as follows.

portion describing the detail of the input type fol-
lows the input sentence.
The sentences are filtered and passed through
Stanford Dependency Parser (Marneffe et al.,
2006) to identify direct as well as transitive de-
pendencies between the nominals. The direct de-
pendency is identified based on the simultaneous
presence of both nominals, &lt;e1&gt; as well as &lt;e2&gt;
in the same dependency relation whereas the tran-
sitive dependencies are verified if &lt;e1&gt; and &lt;e2&gt;
are connected via one or more intermediate de-
pendency relations.
Each of the sentences is passed through a Stan-
ford Named Entity Recognizer (NER)1 for identi-
fying the named entities. The named entities are
the useful hints to separately identify the relations
like Entity-Origin and Entity-Destination from
other relations as the Origin and Destination enti-
ties are tagged by the NER frequently than other
entities.
Different seed lists are prepared for different
types of verbs. For example, the lists for causal

and motion verbs are developed by processing the
XML files of English VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler,
2005). The list of the causal and motion verbs are
prepared by collecting the member verbs if their
corresponding class contain the semantic type
“CAUSE” or “MOTION”. The other verb lists are
prepared manually by reviewing the frequency of
verbs in the training corpus. The WordNet stem-
mer is used to identify the root forms of the verbs.

3 Baseline Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976512820513">
The baseline model is developed based on the
similarity clues present in the phrasal pattern con-
taining verbs and prepositions. Different rules are
identified separately for the nine different rela-
tions. A few WordNet features such as hypernym,
meronym, distance and Common-Parents are
added into the rule-based baseline model. Some of
the relation specific rules are mentioned below.
For example, if any of the nominals contain
their meronym property as “whole” and if the hy-
pernym tree for one of the nominals contains the
word “whole”, the relation is identified as a Com-
ponent-Whole relation. But, the ordering of the
nominals &lt;e1&gt; and &lt;e2&gt; is done based on the
combination of “has”, “with” and “of” with other
word level components.
The relations Cause-Effect, Entity-Destination
are identified based on the causal verbs (cause,
lead etc.) and motion verbs (go, run etc.) respec-
tively. One of the main criteria for extracting these
relations is to verify the presence of causal and
motion verbs in between the text segment of &lt;e1&gt;
and &lt;e2&gt;. Different types of specific relaters (as,
because etc.) are identified from the text segment
as well. It is observed that such specific causal re-
laters help in distinguishing other relations from
Cause-Effect.
If one of the nominals is described as instrument
type in its hypernym tree, the corresponding rela-
tion is identified as Instrument-Agency but the base
level filtering criterion is applied if both the nomi-
nals belong to instrument type. On the other hand,
if any of the nominals belong to the hypernym tree
as content or container or hold type, it returns the
relation Content-Container as a probable answer.
Similarly, if both of them belong to the same type,
the condition is fixed as false criterion for that par-
ticular category. The nominals identified as the
part of collective nouns and associated with
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9999682">
phrases like &amp;quot;of&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;in&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; between &lt;e1&gt; and
&lt;e2&gt; contain the relation of Member-Collection.
The relations e.g. Message-Topic uses seed list of
verbs that satisfy the communication type in the
hypernym tree and Product-Producer relation con-
cerns the hypernym feature as Product type.
But, the identification of the proper ordering of
the entities in the relation, i.e., whether the relation
is valid between &lt;e1, e2&gt; or &lt;e2, e1&gt; is done by
considering the passive sense of the sentence with
the help of the keyword “by” as well as by some
passive dependency relations.
The evaluation of the rule-based baseline sys-
tem on the 8000 training data gives an average F1-
score of 22.45%. The error analysis has shown that
use of lexical features only is not sufficient to ana-
lyze the semantic relation between two nominals
and the performance can be improved by adopting
strategies for differentiating the nominals of a par-
ticular pair.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999465">
To improve the baseline system performance,
CRF-based machine learning framework
(McCallum et al., 2001) is considered for classify-
ing the semantic relations that exist among the or-
dered pair of nominals. Identification of appropri-
ate features plays a crucial role in any machine-
learning framework. The following features are
identified heuristically by manually reviewing the
corpus and based on the frequency of different
verbs in different relations.

Different singleton features and their combinations
are generated from the training corpus. Instead of
considering the whole sentence as an input to the
CRF-based system, only the pairs of nominals are
passed for classification. The previous and next
token of the current token with respect to each of
the relations are added in the template to identify
their co-occurrence nature that in turn help in the
classification process. Synsets containing synony-
mous verbs of the same and different senses are
considered as individual features.

4.1 Feature Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958368421053">
The importance of different features varies accord-
ing to the genre of the relations. For example, the
Common-parents WordNet feature plays an effec-
tive role in identifying the Content-Container and
Product-Producer relations. If the nominals in a
pair share a common Sense ID and Sense Count
then this is considered as a feature. The combina-
tion of multiple features in comparison with a sin-
gle feature generally shows a reasonable perform-
ance enhancement of the present classification sys-
tem. Evaluation on the development data for the
various feature combinations has shown that the
nominalization feature effectively performs for all
the relations. WordNet distance feature is used for
capturing the relations like Content-Container and
Component-Whole. The direct and transitive de-
pendency syntactic features contribute in identify-
ing the relation as well as identify the ordering of
the entities &lt;e1&gt; and &lt;e2&gt; in the relation.
The Named-Entity (NE) relation plays an impor-
tant role in distinguishing the relations, e.g., Entity-
Origin and Entity-Destination from other relations.
The person tagged NEs have been excluded from
the present task as such NEs are not present in the
Entity-Origin and Entity-Destination relations. It
has been observed that the relation specific verbs
supply useful clues to the training phrase for dif-
ferentiating relations among nominals.
The system is trained on 7500 sentences and the
evaluation is carried out on 500 development sen-
tences achieving an F1-Score of 57.56% F1-Score.
The tuning on the development set has been carried
out based on the performance produced by the
individual features that effectively contains
WordNet relations. In addition to that, the
combination of dependency features with verb
feature plays an contributory role on the system
evaluation results.

The active feature list is prepared after achieving
the best possible F1-score of 61.82% on the devel-
opment set of 500 sentences. The final training of
the CRF-based model is carried out on four differ-
ent sets containing 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 sen-
tences. These four training sets are prepared by
extracting sentences from the beginning of the
training corpus and the final evaluation is carried
out on 2717 test sentences as provided by the or-
ganizers. The results on the four test sets termed as
TD1, TD2, TD3 and TD4 are shown in Table 1.
The error analysis is done based on the information
present in the confusion matrices. The fewer occur-
rence of Entity-Destination (e2, e1) instance in the
training corpus plays the negative role in identify-
ing the relation. Mainly, the strategy used for as-
signing the order among the entities, i.e., either
&lt;e1, e2&gt; or &lt;e2, e1&gt; in the already identified re-
lations is the main cause of errors of the system.
The Entity-Origin, Product-Producer and Mes-
sage-Topic relations suffer from overlapping prob-
lem with other relations. Each of the tested nomi-
nal pairs is tagged with more than one relation.
But, selecting the first output tag produced by CRF
is considered as the final relational tag for each of
the nominal pairs. Hence, a distinguishing strategy
needs to be adopted for fine-grained selection.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973923076923">
In our approach to automatic classification of se-
mantic relations between nominals, the system
achieves its best performance using the lexical fea-
ture such as nominalization of WordNet and syn-
tactic information such as dependency relations.
These facts lead us to conclude that semantic fea-
tures from WordNet, in general, play a key role in
the classification task. The present system aims for
assigning class labels to discrete word level entities
but the context feature is not taken into considera-
tion. The future task is to evaluate the performance
of the system by capturing the context present be-
tween the pair of nominals.

The list of the causal and motion verbs are prepared by collecting the member verbs if their corresponding class contain the semantic type “CAUSE” or “MOTION”. The other verb lists are prepared manually by reviewing the frequency of verbs in the training corpus. The WordNet stemmer is used to identify the root forms of the verbs. 3 Baseline Model The baseline model is developed based on the similarity clues present in the phrasal pattern containing verbs and prepositions. Different rules are identified separately for the nine different relations. A few WordNet features such as hypernym, mero</context>
