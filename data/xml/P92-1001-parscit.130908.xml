We investigate various contextual effects on text
interpretation, and account for them by providing
contextual constraints in a logical theory of text
interpretation. On the basis of the way these con-
straints interact with the other knowledge sources,
we draw some general conclusions about the role
of domain-specific information, top-down and bot-
tom-up discourse information flow, and the use-
fulness of formalisation in discourse theory.

Introduction: Time Switching

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884785714286">
Two essential parts of discourse interpretation in-
volve (i) determining the rhetorical role each sen-
tence plays in the text; and (ii) determining the
temporal relations between the events described.
Preceding discourse context has significant effects
on both of these aspects of interpretation. For
example, text (1) in vacuo may be a non-iconic
explanation; the pushing caused the falling and
so explains why Max fell. But the same pair
of sentences may receive an iconic, narrative in-
terpretation in the discourse context provided by
(2): John takes advantage of Max&apos;s vulnerability
while he is lying the ground, to push him over the
edge of the cliff.

So we can see that discourse context can time
switch our interpretation of sentence pairs, (cf.
(1) and (2)); and it can ameliorate it, (cf. (4)&apos;s
improvement of (3)). The purpose of this paper
is two-fold: we attempt to capture formally these
aspects of discourse context&apos;s impact on clausal
attachment; and in the process, we assess whether
the structure of the domain being described might
be sufficient alone to account for the phenomena.
Of course, the idea that discourse context con-
strains the discourse role assigned to the current
clause is by no means new. Reference resolution
is influenced by discourse structure (cf. Grosz
and Sidner 1986:188 for a very clear case); and
it in turn influences discourse structure. Now, on
the one hand, Polanyi and Scha (1984), Hobbs
(1985), and Thompson and Mann (1987) have
argued that &apos;genre&apos; or &apos;rhetorical schemata&apos; can
influence the relations used in discourse attach-
ment. On the other hand, Sibun (1992) has re-
cently argued that domain-specific information,
as opposed to domain-independent rhetorical in-
formation, plays the central role. Both ideas are
intriguing, but so far only the latter has been
specified in sufficient detail to assess how it works
in general, and neither has been applied to time
switching or amelioration in particular.

We limit our discussion to temporal aspects of
discourse interpretation; our strategy here is to
explore two possible contextual constraints; these
state how the discourse context filters the set of
discourse relations and temporal relations which
may be used to attach the current clause to the
representation of the text so far. We then frame
contextual constraints in a logical theory of text
interpretation, where their effects and interactions
can be precisely calculated. We therefore first in-
troduce a domain-specific contextual constraint,
following Sibun, and then place it in a formal the-
ory of discourse attachment called DICE, devel-
oped in Lascarides and Asher (1991a). We then
show how the proposed domain-constraint is in-
sufficient, and demonstrate how it can be aug-
mented by adding a rhetorical, or presentational
constraint to the theory.

Constraints from the
Domain Context
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998683609756098">
In the field of NL generation, Sibun (1992) has
recently argued that coherent text must have a
structure closely related to the domain structure
of its subject matter; naturally, her remarks are
also relevant to NL interpretation. She pursues a
view that task structure, or more generally, do-
main structure, is sufficient to account for many
discourse phenomena (but cf. Grosz and Sidner
1986:182). She examines in detail the generation
of paragraph-length texts describing the layout
of a house. Houses have structure, following from
a basic relation of spatial proximity, and there
are also hierarchical levels to the structure (rooms
can be listed without describing what&apos;s in them,
or the objects within each room can be detailed).
Either way, one constraint on text structure is
defined in terms of the description&apos;s trajectory:
the spatial direction the description moved in the
domain, to get from the objects already described
to the current one. The constraint is: don&apos;t change
trajectory. Sibun argues that in the temporal do-
main, the basic relation is temporal proximity.
But Lascarides and Oberlander (1992a) urge that
the temporal coherence of text is characterised in
terms of, among other things, the stronger ba-
sic relation of causal proximity. So in the latter
domain, Sibun&apos;s domain constraint precludes tex-
tual descriptions which procede from a cause to
an effect to a further cause of that effect, or from
effect to cause to effect.
This Maintain Causal Trajectory (mcr) con-
straint has two important attributes: first, it is
domain-specific; secondly, it introduces into dis-
course interpretation an element of top-down pro-
cessing. To investigate these properties, and see
how far they go towards explaining discourse time
switch, and discourse amelioration, we now incor-
porate MCT into DICE&apos;S formal model of discourse
structure, where its interaction with other causal
information and strategies for interpretation can
be precisely calculated.

Discourse Interpretation and
Commonsense Entailment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99964648">
DICE (Discourse and Commonsense Entailment)
starts with traditional discourse representation
structures (cf. Kamp 1981), but goes on to as-
sume with Grosz and Sidner (1986) that candi-
date discourses possess hierarchical structure, with
units linked by discourse relations modelled af-
ter those proposed by Hobbs (1979, 1985) (cf.
also Thompson and Mann 1987, Scha and Polanyi
1988).1 Lascarides and Asher (1991a) use Narra-
tion, Explanation, Background, Result and Elab-
oration. These are the discourse relations central
to temporal import and they are the only ones we
consider here. Full coverage of text would require
a larger set of relations, akin to that in Thompson
and Mann (1987).
DICE is a dynamic, logical theory for deter-
mining the discourse relations between sentences
in a text, and the temporal relations between
the eventualities they describe. The logic used
is the nonmonotonic logic Commonsense Entail-
ment (CE) proposed by Asher and Morreau (1991).
Implicatures are calculated via default rules. The
rules introduced below are shown in Lascarides
and Asher (1991a) to be manifestations of Gricean-
style pragmatic maxims and world knowledge.

temporal order in interpretation. The Push Causal
Law is a mixture of linguistic knowledge and world
knowledge; given that the clauses are discourse-
related somehow, the events they describe must
normally be connected in a causal, part/whole or
overlap relation; here, given the events in ques-
tion, they must normally stand in a causal rela-
tion. That Causes Precede their Effects is inde-
feasible world knowledge.
We also have laws relating the discourse struc-
ture to the topic structure (Asher, in press): for
example, A Common Topic for Narrative states
that any clauses related by Narration must have
a distinct, common (and perhaps implicit) topic:

The hierarchical discourse structure is similar
to that in Scha and Polanyi (1988): Elaboration
and Explanation are subordinating relations and
the others are coordinating ones. Equally, this
structure defines similar constraints on attach-
ment: the current clause must attach to the pre-
vious clause or else to the clauses it elaborates
or explains. In other words, the open clauses are
those on the right frontier. We do not directly en-
code the nucleus/satellite distinction used in RST
(Thompson and Mann, 1987).

CE and the defeasible rules are used to infer the
discourse—and temporal—structures of candidate
texts. CE represents nonmonotonic validity as
k. Three patterns of nonmonotonic inference are
particularly relevant:
• Defeasible Nodus Ponens: q5&gt; k
e.g. Birds normally fly, Tweety is a bird; so
Tweety flies
• The Penguin Principle:
e.g. Penguins are birds, birds normally fly,
penguins normally don&apos;t fly, Tweety is a
penguin; so Tweety doesn&apos;t fly.

In the absence of further information, the only
rule whose antecedent is satisfied is Narration.
So we infer via Defeasible Modus Ponens that
the Narration relation holds between its clauses.
This then yields, assuming logical omniscience,
an iconic interpretation; the standing up precedes
the greeting. In contrast, text (1) verifies the an-
tecedents to two of our defeasible laws: Narration
and the Push Causal Law. The consequents of
these default laws cannot both hold in a consis-
tent KB. By the Penguin Principle, the law with
the more specific antecedent wins: the Causal
Law, because its antecedent logically entails Nar-
ration&apos;s. Hence (1) is interpreted as: the push-
ing caused the falling. In turn, this entails that
the antecedent to Explanation is verified; and
whilst conflicting with Narration, it&apos;s more spe-
cific, and hence its consequent—Explanation —
follows by the Penguin Principle.3 Notice that
deductions about event structure and discourse
structure are interleaved.
Incoherence and popping: Consider the in-
coherent text (3).
(3) ?Max won the race in record time. He was
home with the cup.
The Win Law captures the intuition that if Max
wins the race and he is at home, then these events
normally don&apos;t temporally overlap—regardless of
whether they&apos;re connected or not.

therefore form a pattern out of which a Nixon
Diamond crystallises: no temporal or discourse
relation can be inferred. We stipulate that it is in-
coherent to assume that (r, a, (3) if one can&apos;t infer
which discourse relation holds between a and #.
So the assumption that the clauses are connected
must be dropped, and hence no representation of
(3) is constructed.
DICE exploits this account of incoherence in its
approach to discourse popping. When a Nixon
Diamond occurs in attempting to attach the cur-
rent clause to the previous one, they don&apos;t form
a coherent text segment. So the current clause
must attach to one of the other open clauses,
resulting in discourse popping (Lascarides and
Asher, 1991a).

It should be clear DICE&apos;S devices, while formal,
are also quite powerful. However, the maxims
introduced so far cannot actually explain either
discourse time switching (cf. (1) vs (2)) or ame-
lioration (cf. (3) vs (4)). Incorporating some
form of contextual constraint may be one way to
deal with such cases. Because DICE makes essen-
tial use of nonmonotonic inference, adding con-
textual constraints will alter the inferences with-
out requiring modification of the existing knowl-
edge representation. We now investigate the con-
sequences of adding MCT.

MCT says how the event structures predicted for

does it interact with other causal knowledge in
DICE? Does it account for time switching? Since
MCT is a contextual constraint, it will only inter-
act with causal knowledge in a discourse context.

Furthermore, assume, in line with intuitions, that
the interpreter has inferred that ep caused e7.
Consider how b is to be attached to the above
discourse structure. 7 is the only open clause; so
(r, -y, 8) must hold. The antecedents to three de-
feasible laws are verified: the Push Causal Law
and Narration just as before, and also MCT. The
consequents of the Push Causal Law and MCT
conflict; moreover, their antecedents aren&apos;t logi-
cally related. So by the Nixon Diamond, we can&apos;t
infer which event—or discourse—relation holds.
Accordingly, the discourse is actually incoherent.
Yet intuitively, a relation can be inferred: the
push happened after the fall, and the clauses 7
and 6 must be related by Narration.
On its own, MCT cannot account for time switch-
ing (or, indeed, amelioration). In one sense this
isn&apos;t surprising. Causal knowledge and MCT were
in conflict in (2), and since both laws relate to
the domain, but in incommensurable ways, nei-
ther logic nor intuition can say which default is
preferred. This suggests that using domain struc-
ture alone to constrain interpretation will be in-
sufficient. It seems likely that presentational is-
sues will be significant in cases such as these;
where domain-specific knowledge sources are in
irresolvable conflict, aspects of the existing dis-
course structure may help determine current clause
attachment. Since MCT has some motivation, it
would be preferrable to let presentational infor-
mation interact with it, rather than replace it.

Constraints from the
Presentational Context
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962166666667">
To what degree does existing rhetorical structure
determine clause attachment? It&apos;s plausible to
suggest that a speaker-writer should not switch
genre without syntactically marking the switch.
Thus, if the preceding context is narrative, then
a hearer-reader will continue to interpret the dis-
course as narrative unless linguistic markers in-
dicate otherwise; similarly for non-narrative con-
texts (cf. Caenepeel 1991, Polanyi and Scha 1984).
This constraint relies on the continuation of a
characteristic pattern of discourse relations, rather
than on maintaining trajectory on some domain
relation. Let&apos;s call this a presentational constraint;
it may be able to get the right analyses of (2) and
(4). In (2), for example, the context to which
John pushed him is attached is narrative, so ac-
cording to the constraint this clause would be
attached with Narration in agreement with in-
tuitions. But clearly, this constraint must be a
soft one, since discourse pops can occur without
syntactic markers, as can interruptions (Polanyi
1985:306). Both of these cause a change in the
discourse &apos;pattern&apos; established in the preceding
context.

terms exactly when an interpreter should try to

Discourse Pattern and Inertia
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99760216">
First, we define the discourse pattern established
by the context in terms of a function DP. This
takes as input the discourse structure for the pre-
ceding context, filters out those discourse rela-
tions which would break the pattern, and outputs
the remaining set of relations. This is similar to
Hobbs&apos; (1985:25-26) notion of genre, where, for
example (in his terms) a story genre requires that
the type of occasion relation can be only problem-
solution or event-outcome.
How much of the preceding discourse context
does DP take as input? At one extreme, it could
be just the discourse relations used to attach the
previous clause; the output would be those same
discourse relations. At the other extreme, the
whole discourse structure may be input; DP would
have to establish the regularity in the configu-
ration of discourse relations, and evaluate which
discourse relation would preserve it when the new
clause is added. We leave this question open; for
the examples of time switching and amelioration
we consider here, DP would produce the same re-
sult whatever it takes as input—Narration.
Using DP, we can represent the discourse pat-
tern constraint. The intuition it captures is the
following. If the sentence currently being pro-
cessed can&apos;t attach to any of the open nodes be-
cause there&apos;s a Nixon Diamond of irresolvable con-
flict, then assume that the discourse relation to be
used is defined by DP. In other words, discourse
pattern preservation applies only when all other
information prevents attachment at all available
open nodes. To express this formally, we need
a representation of a state in which a Nixon Di-
amond has formed. In CE, we use the formula
1 (meaning contradiction) and the connective Sz,
whose semantics is defined only in the context
of default laws (cf. Asher and Morreau 1991b).
Intuitively, (A&amp;B) &gt; 1 means &apos;A and B are an-
tecedents of default rules that lead to a conflict
that can&apos;t be resolved&apos;.
We use this to represent cases where the infor-
mation provided by the clauses a and ,8 (which
are candidates for attachment) form a Nixon Di-
amond. Let Info(a) be glossed &apos;the information
Info is true of the clause a&apos;. It is an abbreviation
for statements such as f all(max , ea), cause(ea,ep),

We will use ND(a, /3) as a gloss for the above
schema, and open(r, a) means a is an open clause
in the discourse structure r; assume that DP(r)
returns some discourse relation R. So the presen-
tational constraint for preserving discourse pat-

The antecedent to Inertia is verified only when all
the information available—except for the preced-
ing discourse pattern—yields a Nixon Diamond
in attempting the attachment of ,3 at all open
nodes. Inertia thus won&apos;t prevent discourse pop-
ping, because there a Nixon Diamond is averted
at a higher-level open node. The model of text
processing proposed here restricts the kind of in-
formation that&apos;s relevant during text processing:
the discourse pattern is relevant only when all
other information is insufficient. Like MCT, Iner-
tia is top-down, in the sense that it relies on ear-
lier predictions about other discourse relations,
rather than on incoming data; but unlike MCT,
the &apos;theory-laden&apos; predictions are only resorted
to if the data seems recalcitrant.

We now look at text (2) in detail. Suppose as
before that the discourse structure r for the first
three clauses in (2) is (2&apos;), and the task now is
to attach .5 (i.e. John pushed him). The only
open clause is 7, because the previous discourse
relations are all Narration. Moreover, DP(7) is
Narration. As before, a Nixon Diamond forms
between MCT and the Push Causal Law in at-
tempting to attach b to 7. Where Arno is the
antecedent to MCT, and Apci the antecedent to
the Push Causal Law substituted with -y and 6:

The antecedent to Inertia entails that of Maintain
Trajectory (Amet) and that of Push Causal Law
In CE the most specific law wins. So the
discourse context in this case determines the re-
lation between the fall and the push: it is Narra-
tion. Hence even though INK yields a causal pref-
erence for the pushing causing the falling, given
the discourse context in which the pushing and
falling are described in (2), Narration is inferred
after all, and so the falling precedes the push.
In this way, we can represent the presentational,
and domain-specific, information that must be
brought to bear to create a time switch.&apos;

Now consider texts (3) and (4). A Nixon Dia-

the same clauses (4e) and (4f).

Given the discourse (4a–e), (4e) is the only open

in (3), attempting to attach (4f) to (4e) results

where no discourse relation was inferred, leading
to incoherence.
Inertia enables discourse context to establish
coherence between sentence pairs that, in isola-
tion, are incoherent. It would be worrying if Iner-
tia were so powerful that it could ameliorate any
text. But incoherence is still possible: consider
replacing (4f) with (4r):
f . ?Mary&apos;s hair was black.
If world knowledge is coded as intuitions would
suggest, then no common topic can be constructed
for (4e) and (4f&apos;); and this is necessary if they are
to be attached with Narration or Background—
the only discourse relations available given the de-
feasible laws that are verified. Moreover, Inertia
won&apos;t improve the coherence in this case because
it predicts Narration, which because of Common
Topic for Narration cannot be used to attach (4f&apos;)
to (4e). So the text is incoherent.
Hobbs et al (1990) also explore the effects of
linguistic and causal knowledge on interpretation,
using abduction rather than deduction. Now,
Konolige (1991) has shown that abduction and
nonmonotonic deduction are closely related; but
since Hobbs et al don&apos;t attempt to treat time-
switching and amelioration, direct comparison here
is difficult. However, the following points are rel-
evant. First, weighted abduction, as a system of
inference, isn&apos;t embeddable in CE, and vice versa.
Secondly, the weights which guide abduction are
assigned to predicates in a context-free fashion.
Hobbs et al observe that this may make the ef-
fects of context hard to handle, since &apos;the abduc-
tion scheme attempts to make global judgements
on the basis of strictly local information&apos; [p48].

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997587583333333">
We examined instances of two types of contextual
constraint on current clause attachment. These
were Maintain Causal Trajectory, a domain con-
straint; and Inertia, a presentational constraint.
We argued that domain constraints seemed insuf-
ficient, but that presentational constraints could
constructively interact with them. This interac-
tion then explains the two discourse interpreta-
tion phenomena we started out with. Context can
switch round the order of events; and it can ame-
liorate an otherwise incoherent interpretation.
Both of the constraints allow predictions about

new discourse relations to be driven from previ-
ous predictions. But MCT simply adds its predic-
tion to the data-driven set from which the logic
chooses, whereas discourse pattern and Inertia
are only relevant to interpretation when the logic
can otherwise find no discourse relation.
This formalisation has also raised a number of
questions for future investigation. For example,
the discourse pattern (or Hobbsian &apos;genre&apos;) func-
tion is important; but how much of the preceding
discourse structure should the DP function take
as input? How do we establish—and improve—
the linguistic coverage? What is the relation be-
tween communicative intentions and contextual
constraints? How do we actually implement con-
textual constraints in a working system?
The idea of contextual constraints is a famil-
iar and comfortable one. In this respect, we have
merely provided one way of formally pinning it
down. Naturally, this requires a background log-
ical theory of discourse structure, and we have
used DICE, which has its own particular set of dis-
course relations and implicature patterns. How-
ever, the process of logically specifying the con-
straints has two important and general benefits,
independent of the particular formalisation we
have offered. First, it demands precision and uni-
formity in the statement both of the new con-
straints, and of the other knowledge sources used
in interpretation. Secondly, it permits a program-
independent assessment of the consequences of
the general idea of contextual constraints.

DICE is a dynamic, logical theory for determining the discourse relations between sentences in a text, and the temporal relations between the eventualities they describe. The logic used is the nonmonotonic logic Commonsense Entailment (CE) proposed by Asher and Morreau (1991). Implicatures are calculated via default rules.

If the sentence currently being processed can&apos;t attach to any of the open nodes because there&apos;s a Nixon Diamond of irresolvable conflict, then assume that the discourse relation to be used is defined by DP. In other words, discourse pattern preservation applies only when all other information prevents attachment at all available open nodes. To express this formally, we need a representation of a state in which a Nixon Diamond has formed. In CE, we use the formula 1 (meaning contradiction) and the connective Sz, whose semantics is defined only in the context of default laws (cf. Asher and Morreau 1991b). Intuitively, (A&amp;B) &gt; 1 means &apos;A and B are antecedents of default rules that lead to a conflict that can&apos;t be resolved&apos;. We use this to represent cases where the information provided by the clauses a and ,8 (which are candidates for attachment) form a Nixon Diamond.

Since MCT has some motivation, it would be preferrable to let presentational information interact with it, rather than replace it. Constraints from the Presentational Context To what degree does existing rhetorical structure determine clause attachment? It&apos;s plausible to suggest that a speaker-writer should not switch genre without syntactically marking the switch. Thus, if the preceding context is narrative, then a hearer-reader will continue to interpret the discourse as narrative unless linguistic markers indicate otherwise; similarly for non-narrative contexts (cf. Caenepeel 1991, Polanyi and Scha 1984). This constraint relies on the continuation of a characteristic pattern of discourse relations, rather than on maintaining trajectory on some domain relation. Let&apos;s call this a presentational constraint; it may be able to get the right analyses of (2) and (4). In (2), for example, the context to which John pushed him is attached is narrative, so according to the constraint this clause would be attached with Narration in agreement with intuitions. But clearly, this constraint must be a soft one, since discourse pops can occur without syntactic markers, as can interrupti</context>

Constraints from the Domain Context In the field of NL generation, Sibun (1992) has recently argued that coherent text must have a structure closely related to the domain structure of its subject matter; naturally, her remarks are also relevant to NL interpretation. She pursues a view that task structure, or more generally, domain structure, is sufficient to account for many discourse phenomena (but cf. Grosz and Sidner 1986:182). She examines in detail the generation of paragraph-length texts describing the layout of a house. Houses have structure, following from a basic relation of spatial proximity, and there are also hierarchical levels to the structure (rooms can be listed without describing what&apos;s in them, or the objects within each room can be detailed). Either way, one constraint on text structure is defined in terms of the description&apos;s trajectory: the spatial direction the description moved in the domain, to get from the objects already described to the current one.

Now, Konolige (1991) has shown that abduction and nonmonotonic deduction are closely related; but since Hobbs et al don&apos;t attempt to treat timeswitching and amelioration, direct comparison here is difficult.

This constraint relies on the continuation of a characteristic pattern of discourse relations, rather than on maintaining trajectory on some domain relation. Let&apos;s call this a presentational constraint; it may be able to get the right analyses of (2) and (4). In (2), for example, the context to which John pushed him is attached is narrative, so according to the constraint this clause would be attached with Narration in agreement with intuitions. But clearly, this constraint must be a soft one, since discourse pops can occur without syntactic markers, as can interruptions (Polanyi 1985:306). Both of these cause a change in the discourse &apos;pattern&apos; established in the preceding context. Patterns in DICE Can we use presentational constraints without accidentally blocking discourse popping and interruptions? The problem is to represent in formal Narration 7 5 terms exactly when an interpreter should try to preserve the pattern of rhetorical structure established in the context. Because DICE provides a formal account of how discourse popping occurs— the Nixon Diamond is the key—we are in a good position to attempt this.

That Causes Precede their Effects is indefeasible world knowledge. We also have laws relating the discourse structure to the topic structure (Asher, in press): for example, A Common Topic for Narrative states that any clauses related by Narration must have a distinct, common (and perhaps implicit) topic: • A Common Topic for Narrative N arration(a, 13) (37)(7 a A 7 /3) A —1(a /3) A —1(/3 ct) The hierarchical discourse structure is similar to that in Scha and Polanyi (1988): Elaboration and Explanation are subordinating relations and the others are coordinating ones. Equally, this structure defines similar constraints on attachment: the current clause must attach to the previous clause or else to the clauses it elaborates or explains. In other words, the open clauses are those on the right frontier. We do not directly encode the nucleus/satellite distinction used in RST (Thompson and Mann, 1987).

We then frame contextual constraints in a logical theory of text interpretation, where their effects and interactions can be precisely calculated.

We then show how the proposed domain-constraint is insufficient, and demonstrate how it can be augmented by adding a rhetorical, or presentational constraint to the theory. Constraints from the Domain Context In the field of NL generation, Sibun (1992) has recently argued that coherent text must have a structure closely related to the domain structure of its subject matter; naturally, her remarks are also relevant to NL interpretation. She pursues a view that task structure, or more generally, domain structure, is sufficient to account for many discourse phenomena (but cf. Grosz and Sidner 1986:182).
