Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999814363636364">
Morphological analysis and disambigua-
tion are crucial stages in a variety of nat-
ural language processing applications
such as machine translation, especially
when languages with complex morphol-
ogy are concerned such as Arabic. Arab-
ic is a highly flexional language, in that,
the same root can lead to various forms
according to its context. In this paper, we
present a system which disambiguates
the output of a morphological analyzer
for Arabic. The Arabic morphological
analyzer used consists of a set of all
possible morphological analyses for each
word, with the unique correct syntactic
feature. We want to choose the correct
features using the features generated by
the morphological analyzer for the
French language in the other side. To ob-
tain this data, we used the results of the
alignment of word trained with GIZA++
(Och and Ney, 2003).

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922188679245">
Arabic is characterized by a rich morphology.
Due to the fact that the Arabic script usually
does not encode short vowels, the degree of
morphological ambiguity is very high. In addi-
tion to being inflected for gender, number,
words can be attached to various clitics for con-
junction &amp;quot;9&amp;quot; (and), the definite article &amp;quot;J�&amp;quot; (the),
prepositions (e.g. &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; (by/with), &amp;quot;J&amp;quot; (for), &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;
(as)), object pronouns (e.g. &amp;quot;?A&amp;quot; (their/them)).
The morphological analysis of a word consists
of determining morphological information about
each word, such as part-of-speech (i.e., noun,
verb, particle, etc), voice, gender, number, in-
formation about the clitics, etc. Morphological
analysis and disambiguation are crucial pre-
processing steps for a variety of natural language
processing applications, from search and infor-
mation extraction to machine translation. For
languages with complex morphology these are
nontrivial processes.
Arabic words are often ambiguous in their
morphological analysis. This is due to Arabic’s
rich system of affixation and clitics and the
omission of disambiguating short vowels. The
problem is that many words have different
meanings depending on their diacritization. This
leads to ambiguity when processing data for nat-
ural language processing applications such as
machine translation. This propriety has an im-
portant implication for statistical modeling of the
Arabic language.
In this paper, we present a novel morphology
preprocessing technique for Arabic. We exploit
the Arabic morphology-French alignment to
choose a correct morpho-syntactic feature pro-
duced by a morphological analyzer.
This paper is organized as follows: section 2
gives a brief description of some related works
to the introduction of morphological disambigu-
ation. Section 3 presents the used morphological
analyzer Morph2 for Arabic texts, able to recog-
nize word composition and to provide more spe-
cific morphological information about it. We
present in section 4 some problems in context
morpho-syntactic feature choice; in the remaind-
er of this section we discuss the complexity of
Arabic morphology and the challenge of mor-
phological disambiguation. Section 5 gives a
short overview of the data and tools used for our
Arabic word Morpho-syntactic feature disam-
biguation and shows the experimental details of
our system. Finally, section 6 presents some
conclusions.

Morphological analysis and disambiguation are
crucial pre-processing steps for a variety of
natural language processing applications.
Previous research has focused on
disambiguating the output of a morphological
analyzer. Hajic (2000) is the first to use a
dictionary as a source of possible morphological
analyses (and hence tags) for an inflected word
form. He convincingly shows that for five
Eastern European languages with complex
inflection plus English, using a morphological
analyzer improves performance of a tagger. He
concludes that for highly inflectional languages
“the use of an independent morphological
dictionary is the preferred choice more annotated
data”. He redefines the tagging task as a choice
among the tags proposed by the dictionary, using
a log-linear model trained on specific ambiguity
classes for individual morphological features.
Hajic (2000) demonstrates convincingly that
morphological disambiguation can be aided by a
morphological analyzer, which, given a word
without any context, gives us the set of all
possible morphological tags.
The only work on Arabic tagging that uses a
corpus for training and evaluation, (Diab et al.,
2004), does not use a morphological analyzer.
Diab et al. (2004) perform tokenization, POS
tagging and base phrase chunking using a SVM
based learner.
The Morphological Analysis and
Disambiguation of Arabic (MADA) system is
described in (Habash and Rambow, 2005). The
basic approach used in MADA is inspired by the
work of Hajic (2000) for tagging
morphologically rich languages, which was
extended to Arabic. Habash and Rambow (2005)
use SVM-classifiers for individual
morphological features and a simple combining
scheme for choosing among competing analyses
proposed by the dictionary.

Arabic is a morphologically complex language.
Compared with French, an Arabic word can
sometimes correspond to a whole French sen-
tence (Example : the Arabic word &amp;quot;ﺎﻨﻧوﺮّآﺬﺘﺗأ&amp;quot; cor-
responds in French to the sentence &amp;quot;Est-ce que
vous vous souvenez de nous&amp;quot;, in English: &amp;quot;Do
you remember us&amp;quot;).
The aim of a morphological analysis step is to
recognize word composition and to provide spe-
cific morphological information about it. For
Example : the word &amp;quot;نﻮﻓﺮﻌﻳ&amp;quot; (in French: con-
naîssent, in English: they know) is the result of
the concatenation of the prefix &amp;quot;ي&amp;quot; indicating the
present and suffix &amp;quot;نو&amp;quot; indicating the plural
masculine of the verb &amp;quot;فﺮﻋ&amp;quot; (in French: con-
naître, in English: to know). The morphological
analyzer determines for each word the list of all
its possible morphological features.
In Arabic language, some conjugated verbs or
inflected nouns can have the same orthographic
form due to absence of vowels (Example : non-
voweled Arabic word &amp;quot;ﻞﺼﻓ&amp;quot; can be a verb in the
past &amp;quot;َﻞَﺼَﻓ&amp;quot; (He dismissed), or a masculine noun
&amp;quot;ٌﻞْﺼَﻓ&amp;quot; (chapter / season), or a concatenation of
the coordinating conjunction &amp;quot;فَ &amp;quot; (then) with the
verb &amp;quot;ﻞﺻ&amp;quot;: imperative of the verb (bind)).
In this work, In order to handle the morpho-
logical ambiguities, we decide to use MORPH2
(Belguith et al., 2006), an Arabic morphological
analyzer developed at the Miracl laboratory1.
MORPH2 is based on a knowledge-based com-
putational method. It accepts as input an Arabic
text, a sentence or a word. Its morphological dis-
ambiguation and analysis method is based on
five steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.973464444444445">
• A tokenization process is applied in a
first step. It consists of two sub-steps.
First, the text is divided into sentences,
using the system Star (Belguith et al.,
2005), an Arabic text tokenizer based on
contextual exploration of punctuation
marks and conjunctions of coordination.
The second sub-step detects the different
words in each sentence.
• A morphological preprocessing step
which aims to extract clitics agglutinated
to the word. A filtering process is then
applied to check out if the remaining
word is a particle, a number, a date, or a
proper noun.
• An affixal analysis is then applied to de-
termine all possible affixes and roots. It
aims to identify basic elements belonging

to the constitution of a word (the root and
affixes i.e. prefix, infix and suffix).
• The morphological analysis step consists
of determining for each word, all its
possible morpho-syntactic features (i.e,
part of speech, gender, number, time,
person, etc.). Morpho-syntactic features
detection is made up on three stages. The
first stage identifies the part-of-speech of
the word (i.e. verb &amp;quot;ﻞﻌﻓ&amp;quot;, noun &amp;quot;ﻢﺳا&amp;quot;, par-
ticle &amp;quot;ةادأ&amp;quot; and proper noun &amp;quot;ﻢﻠﻋ ﻢﺳا&amp;quot;). The
second stage extracts for each part-of-
speech a list of its morpho-syntactic fea-
tures. A filtering of these feature lists is
made in the third stage.

<bodyText confidence="0.9452330625">
handled word is fully vocalized accord-
ing to its morpho-syntactic features de-
termined in the previous step.
In our method, each Arabic word, from Arab-
ic data, is replaced by its segmented form, where
stem, clitic and affix are featured with their
morphological classes (e.g. proclitic, prefix,
stem, suffix and enclitic). For example: the word
&amp;quot;ﻢهﺎﻨﻓﺮﻌﻓ&amp;quot; (in French: &amp;quot;et nous les avons connu&amp;quot;,
in English: &amp;quot;and we have known them&amp;quot;) is the
result of the concatenation of the proclitic &amp;quot;َف&amp;quot;
(then): coordinating conjunction, the suffix &amp;quot;ﺎﻧ&amp;quot;
for the present masculine plural, enclitic &amp;quot;ﻢه&amp;quot; (for
the masculine plural possession pronoun), and
the rest of the word &amp;quot;فﺮﻋ&amp;quot; indicating the stem.
So, the word &amp;quot;ﻢهﺎﻨﻓﺮﻌﻓ&amp;quot; will be replaced by:

<bodyText confidence="0.999506214285715">
As mentioned in section 1, ambiguities in Arabic
word are mainly caused by the absence of the
short vowels. Thus, a word can have different
meanings. There are also the usual homographs
of uninflected words with/without the same pro-
nunciation, which have different meanings and
usually different POS’s. For example: the word
&amp;quot;ﺐهذ&amp;quot;, in English: &amp;quot;gold&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ﺐهذ&amp;quot;, in English:
&amp;quot;go&amp;quot;. In Arabic there are four categories of
words: noun, proper noun, verbs and particles.
The absence of short vowels can cause ambigui-
ties within the same category or across different
categories. For example: the word &amp;quot;ﺪﻌﺑ&amp;quot; corres-
ponds to many categories (table 1).

Arabic uses a diverse system of prefixes, suf-
fixes, and pronouns that are attached to the
words (Soudi, 2007).
In fact, in Arabic language, the word: &amp;quot;ﻊﺿو&amp;quot;
can be a verb in the past (He filed), or a mascu-
line noun (state), or a concatenation of the coor-
dinating conjunction &amp;quot;و&amp;quot; (and) with the verb
&amp;quot;ﻊﺿ&amp;quot;: imperative of the verb (filed). For this rea-
son, correct morphological analysis is required
to resolve structural ambiguities among Arabic
sentence.

The obtained output consists of a set of all
possible morphological analyses for each word,
with the unique correct analysis. One needs to
select the right meaning by looking at the con-
text. Given the highly inflection nature of Arab-
ic, resolving ambiguities is syntactically harder
within the same category. We want to choose the
correct output using the features generated by
TreeTagger applied to the French corpus.
To obtain this correct feature, we needed to
match data in the segmented Arabic corpus to
the lexeme and feature representation output by
TreeTagger. The matching included the results
of the alignment of word between the segmented
Arabic corpus and the part-of-speech tagged
French corpus.
Example : the word &amp;quot;ﻢهﺎﻨﻓﺮﻌﻓ&amp;quot; (in French: &amp;quot;et

known them&amp;quot;) is segmented by:

The stem &amp;quot;فﺮﻋ&amp;quot; is aligned with the word:
&amp;quot;connu&amp;quot; : the past participle of the verb &amp;quot;con-
naître&amp;quot; (in English : &amp;quot;known&amp;quot;). We can deduce
that the part of speech of the stem &amp;quot;فﺮﻋ&amp;quot; is a
verb.
Morpho-syntactic features provided by Tree-
Tagger are verb, proper noun, noun, adjective,
adverb, conjunction, pronoun, preposition, etc.
The morpho-syntactic feature of Arabic words
aligned with French words tagged by adjective
or noun will be replaced by the morpho-
syntactic feature : noun: &amp;quot;ﻢﺳا&amp;quot;. While, the mor-
pho-syntactic feature : adverb, conjunction, or
prepostion will be replaced by the Arabic mor-
pho-syntactic feature : particle : &amp;quot;ةادأ&amp;quot;.
We can attest that the use of morpho-syntactic
features provided by the part-of-speech tagged
corpus in the other side can remove disambigua-
tion of morpho-syntactic feature of the Arabic
word provided by a morphological analyser, es-
pecially for agglutinative and inflectional lan-

The performance of treetagger-to-morph2 is
better than the baseline BASELINE. The errors

caused by the presence of homographs of Arabic

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999858870967742">
Morphological disambiguation of Arabic is a
difficult task which involves, in theory, thou-
sands of possible tags.
In this paper, we present a system which dis-
ambiguates the output of a morphological ana-
lyzer for Arabic. Arabic is a morphologically
rich language, and Morphological analysis and
disambiguation are crucial stages in a variety of
natural language processing applications.
We first applied an Arabic word segmentation
step, to improve the alignments models. So we
use the Arabic morphological analyzer
MORPH2. Then, we proposed to use TreeTag-
ger tool, able to annotate text with part-of-
speech and lemma information, where each
word from French corpus is agglutinated to its
part-of-speech (POS). The sentence alignment
between Arabic and French corpus was trained
with GIZA++. The core idea is to avoid morpho-
syntactic ambiguity of the Arabic words ob-
tained in the MORPH2 output by using the part
of speech of corresponding aligned French word.
We showed that imposing Arabic-French align-
ment dependent constraints on possible se-
quences of analyses improves the morphological
disambiguation.
Future work will focus on taking advantage of
our efficient technique. We are very interested to
use Word Morpho-syntactic feature disambigua-
tion to build up an efficient French-Arabic trans-
lation system.

Previous research has focused on disambiguating the output of a morphological analyzer. Hajic (2000) is the first to use a dictionary as a source of possible morphological analyses (and hence tags) for an inflected word form. He convincingly shows that for five Eastern European languages with complex inflection plus English, using a morphological analyzer improves performance of a tagger. He concludes that for highly inflectional languages “the use of an independent morphological dictionary is the preferred choice more annotated data”.

In this paper, we present a system which disambiguates the output of a morphological analyzer for Arabic. The Arabic morphological analyzer used consists of a set of all possible morphological analyses for each word, with the unique correct syntactic feature. We want to choose the correct features using the features generated by the morphological analyzer for the French language in the other side. To obtain this data, we used the results of the alignment of word trained with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). 1 Introduction Arabic is characterized by a rich morphology. Due to the fact that the Arabic script usually does not encode short vowels, the degree of morphological ambiguity is very high. In addition to being inflected for gender, number, words can be attached to various clitics for conjunction &amp;quot;9&amp;quot; (and), the definite article &amp;quot;J�&amp;quot; (the), prepositions (e.g. &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; (by/with), &amp;quot;J&amp;quot; (for), &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; (as)), object pronouns (e.g. &amp;quot;?A&amp;quot; (their/them)). The morphological analysis of a word consists of determining morphological information about each word, such as part-of-speech (i.e., noun, verb, particle, et</context>

For this reason, correct morphological analysis is required to resolve structural ambiguities among Arabic sentence. 5 Word Morpho-syntactic feature disambiguation 5.1 Training corpus The training corpus used in this work is an Arabic-French bitext aligned at the sentence level. Each Arabic word, from Arabic data, is replaced by its segmented form. In the other side, the French corpus is part-of-speech (POS) tagged by using treetagger tool (Schmid, 1994) for annotating text with part-of-speech and lemma information. 5.2 Alignment model The aligned model was trained with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), which implements the most typical IBM and HMM alignment models. The alignment model used consists of IBM-1, HMM, IBM-3 and IBM-4. 5.3 Using treetagger for Arabic Word Morpho-syntactic feature disambiguation To pre-process the Arabic data, we use the MORPH2 morphological analyzer (Belguith et al., 2006). A sample output of the morphological analyzer is shown in Figure 1. 63 Figure 1.
