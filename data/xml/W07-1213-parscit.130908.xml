In the paper, we describe methods for
exploitation of a new lexical database of
valency frames (VerbaLex) in relation to
Transparent Intensional Logic (TIL). We
present a detailed description of the
Complex Valency Frames (CVF) as they
appear in VerbaLex including basic
ontology of the VerbaLex semantic roles.
TIL is a typed logical system developed for
natural language semantic representation
using TIL logical forms known as
constructions. TIL is well suited to handle
the difficult language phenomena such as
temporal relations, intensionality and
propositional attitudes. Here we make use
of the long-term development of the
Normal Translation Algorithm aimed at
automatic translation of natural language
sentences into TIL constructions.
We examine the relations between CVFs
and TIL constructions of predicate-
argument structures and discuss the
procedure of automatic acquisition of the
verbal object constructions. The
exploitation of CVFs in the syntactic
parsing is also briefly mentioned.

valency lexicon, see (Hlaváčková, Horák, Kadlec
2006). To this end we first present a brief survey of
the logic we are going to use, namely Transparent
Intensional Logic (TIL), which was originated by
P. Tichý (Tichý 1988). Theoretical aspects of TIL
were further developed in particular by P. Materna
(Materna 1998) and also by co-authors of this
paper (see, Materna, Duží 2005, Horák 2002). A
question may be asked why we do not exploit first
order predicate logic (PL1) where some of the
presented problems have already been explored
and PL1 has been used to represent logical forms.
It is a well established fact that PL1 is not able to
handle systematically the phenomena like
propositional verbs (which, of course, appear in
our valency frames), grammatical tenses and
modalities (modal verbs and modal particles in
natural language). On the other hand, since TIL
works with types these problems either do not arise
or they can be solved in an intuitive way (see Ti-
chý 1988).
In the second linguistic section we present CVFs
by means of which the semantics of verbs in
natural language such as Czech or English can be
described.
In Section 3 we show how CVFs describe the
surface valencies of verbs (i.e. their respective
morphological cases in Czech) as well as the
semantics of their predicate-argument structure.
Concerning the latter we make use of the deep
semantic roles expressed by two-level labels based
partly on the Top Ontology (EuroWordNet) and
partly on the selected literals from Princeton
WordNet.
Since so far these two ways of description, namely
the logical and linguistic one, have been treated
separately, the task we set is to propose a method

of their interrelation and coordination. Needless to
say that both ways of description of verb semantics
are useful.
Hence we are going to show how to combine a
logical description using mostly terms like types,
individuals, classes, relations, propositions, or, in
general, constructions of these entities, with the
linguistic framework capturing the idiosyncratic
semantic features of the verbs such as
SUBS(liquid:1) or AG(person:1|animal:1).
In Section 4 we adduce an example of the analysis
of selected English and Czech verbs for which the
above mentioned integration has been proposed.

2 Basics of Transparent Intensional
Logic
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999665">
In this Section we provide an introductory
explanation of the main notions of Transparent
Intensional Logic (TIL). For exact definitions and
details see, e.g., Tichý (1988), Tichý (2004),
Materna (1998), Materna (2004) and Materna,
Duží (2005). TIL approach to knowledge
representation can be characterised as the ‘top-
down approach’. TIL ‘generalises to the hardest
case’ and obtains the ‘less hard cases’ by lifting
various restrictions that apply only higher up. This
way of proceeding is opposite to how semantic
theories tend to be built up. The standard approach
(e.g. predicate logic) consists in beginning with
atomic sentences, then proceeding to molecular
sentences formed by means of truth-functional
connectives or by quantifiers, and from there to
sentences containing modal operators and, finally,
attitudinal operators.
Thus, to use a simple case for illustration, once a
vocabulary and rules of formation have been laid
down, semantics gets off the ground by analysing
an atomic sentence as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997528375">
(1) “Charles is happy”: Fa
And further upwards:
(2) “Charles is happy, and Thelma is
grumpy”: Fa ∧ Gb
(3) “Somebody is happy”: ∃x (Fx)
(4) “Possibly, Charles is happy”: O (Fa)
(5) “Thelma believes that Charles is happy”:
Bb (Fa).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997381875">
In non-hyperintensional (i.e., non-procedural)
theories of formal semantics, attitudinal operators
are swallowed by the modal ones. But when they
are not, we have three levels of granularity: the
coarse level of truth-values, the fine-grained level
of truth-conditions (propositions, truth-values-in-
intension), and the very fine-grained level of
hyper-propositions, i.e., constructions of
propositions. TIL operates with these three levels
of granularity. We start out by analysing sentences
from the uppermost end, furnishing them with a
hyperintensional1 semantics, and working our way
downwards, furnishing even the lowest-end
sentences (and other empirical expressions) with a
hyperintensional semantics. That is, the sense of a
sentence such as “Charles is happy” is a hyper-
proposition, namely the construction of the
denoted proposition (i.e., the instruction how to
evaluate the truth-conditions of the sentence in any
state of affairs).
When assigning a construction to an expression as
its meaning, we specify a procedural know-how,
which must not be confused with the respective
performancy know-how. Distinguishing
performatory know-how from procedural know-
how, the latter could be characterised “that a
knower x knows how A is done in the sense that x
can spell out instructions for doing A.” For
instance, to know what Goldbach Conjecture
means is to understand the instruction to find
whether ‘all positive even integers ≥ 4 can be
expressed as the sum of two primes’. It does not
include either actually finding out (whether it is
true or not by following a procedure or by luck) or
possessing the skill to do so.2
Furthermore, the sentence “Charles is happy” is an
‘intensional context’, in the sense that its logical
analysis must involve reference to empirical
parameters, in this case both possible worlds and
instants of time. Charles is only contingently
happy; i.e., he is only happy at some worlds and
only sometimes. The other reason is because the
analysans must be capable of figuring as an
argument for functions whose domain are
propositions rather than truth-values. Construing
‘Fa’ as a name of a truth-value works only in the
case of (1), (2) and (3). It won’t work in (5), since
truth-values are not the sort of thing that can be

Max Cresswell in Cresswell (1975). See also

believed. Nor will it work in (4), since truth-values
are not the sort of thing that can be possible.
Constructions are procedures, or instructions,
specifying how to arrive at less-structured entities.
Being procedures, constructions are structured
from the algorithmic point of view, unlike set-
theoretical objects. The TIL ‘language of
constructions’ is a modified hyper-intensional
version of the typed λ-calculus, where Montague-
like λ-terms denote, not the functions constructed,
but the constructions themselves. Constructions
qua procedures operate on input objects (of any
type, even on constructions of any order) and yield
as output (or, in well defined cases fail to yield)
objects of any type; in this way constructions
construct partial functions, and functions, rather
than relations, are basic objects of our ontology.
By claiming that constructions are algorithmically
structured, we mean the following: a construction
C ― being an instruction ― consists of particular
steps, i.e., sub-instructions (or, constituents) that
have to be executed in order to execute C. The
concrete/abstract objects an instruction operates on
are not its constituents, they are just mentioned.
Hence objects have to be supplied by another
(albeit trivial) construction. The constructions
themselves may also be only mentioned: therefore
one should not conflate using constructions as
constituents of composed constructions and
mentioning constructions that enter as input into
composed constructions, so we have to strictly
distinguish between using and mentioning
constructions. Just briefly: Mentioning is, in
principle, achieved by using atomic constructions.
A construction is atomic if it is a procedure that
does not contain any other construction as a used
subconstruction (a constituent). There are two
atomic constructions that supply objects (of any
type) on which complex constructions operate:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.603876">
variables and trivializations.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999831619047619">
Variables are constructions that construct an object
dependently on valuation: they v-construct, where
v is the parameter of valuations. When X is an
object (including constructions) of any type, the
Trivialization of X, denoted °X, constructs X
without the mediation of any other construction. 0X
is the atomic concept of X: it is the primitive, non-
perspectival mode of presentation of X.
There are three compound constructions, which
consist of other constructions: Composition,
Closure and Double Execution. Composition [X Y1
... Y,„] is the procedure of applying a function f v-
constructed by X to an argument A v-constructed
by Y1,...,Ym, i.e., the instruction to apply f to A to
obtain the value (if any) of f at A. Closure
[λ xl... x,„ Y] is the procedure of constructing a
function by abstracting over variables, i.e., the
instruction to do so. Finally, higher-order
construction X can be used twice over as a
constituent of a composed construction. This is
achieved by the fifth construction called Double

TIL constructions, as well as the entities they
construct, all receive a type. On the ground level of
the type-hierarchy, there are entities unstructured
from the algorithmic point of view belonging to a
type of order 1. Given a so-called epistemic (or
‘objectual’) base of ato,„ic types (ο-truth values,
ι-individuals, τ-time moments / real numbers, ω -
possible worlds), mereological complexity is
increased by the induction rule for forming partial
functions: where α, β1,...,βn are types of order 1,
the set of partial mappings from β1 ×...× βn to α,
denoted (αβ1...βn), is a type of order 1 as well.
Constructions that construct entities of order 1 are
constructions of order 1. They belong to a type of
order 2, denoted by *1. Inductively we define type
of order n, *,,.
TIL is specific in a precise solution for intensions
as non-empirical objects of the real world.
Intensions are qualified as functions of a type
((ατ)ω), i.e., functions from possible worlds to
chronologies of the type α (in symbols: ατω),
where a chronology is a function of type (ατ).
Some important kinds of intensions are:
Propositions, type οτω (shortened as π). They are
denoted by empirical (declarative) sentences.
Properties of members of a type α, or simply α-
properties, type (οα)τω.3 General terms (some
substantives, intransitive verbs) denote properties,
mostly of individuals.
Relations-in-intension, type (οβ1...βm)τω. For
example transitive empirical verbs, also attitudinal
verbs denote these relations. Omitting the
τω we get
type (οβ1...βm) of relations-in-extension (to be met
mainly in mathematics).

3 The Complex Valency Frames
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.956954444444444">
Valency frames have been built in several projects
(VALLEX for Czech PDT (Žabokrtský 2005) or
VerbNet (Kipper et al 2006)). Motivation for the
VerbaLex project came from comparing Czech
WordNet verb frames with VALLEX. The main
goal of VerbaLex is an automatic processing of
verb phrases exploiting explicit links to Princeton
WordNet. The complex valency frames we are
working with can be characterized as data
structures (tree graphs) describing predicate-
argument structure of a verb which contains the
verb itself and the arguments determined by the
verb meaning (their number usually varies from 1-
5). The argument structure also displays the
semantic preferences on the arguments. On the
syntactic (surface) level the arguments are most
frequently expressed as noun or pronominal groups
in one of the seven cases (in Czech) and also as
prepositional cases or adverbials.
An example of a complex valency frame for the
verb zabít (kill) looks like:
usmrtit:1/zabít:1/dostat:11 (kill:1)

has killed the victim with a knife).

-use: prim
More examples of CVFs for some selected verbs
can be found below in Section 4.
The semantics of the arguments is typically labeled
as belonging to a given semantic role (or deep
case), which represents a general role plus
subcategorization features (or selectional
restrictions). Thus valency frames in Verbalex
include information about:
1. the syntactic (surface) information about
the syntactic valencies of a verb, i.e. what
morphological cases (direct and
prepositional ones in highly inflected
languages such as Czech) are associated
with (required by) a particular verb, and
also adverbials,
2. semantic roles (deep cases) that represent
the integration of the general labels with
subcategorization features (or selectional
restrictions) required by the meaning of the
verb.
The inventory of the semantic roles is partly
inspired by the Top Ontology and Base Concepts
as they have been defined within EuroWordNet
project. Thus we work with the general or ‘large’
roles like AG, ART(IFACT), SUBS(TANCE),
PART, CAUSE, OBJ(ECT) (natural object),
INFO(RMATION), FOOD, GARMENT,
VEHICLE and others. They are combined with the
literals from Princeton WordNet 2.0 where literals
represent subcategorization features allowing us to
climb down the hypero/hyponymical trees to the
individual lexical units. For example, we have
AG(person:1|animal:1) or SUBS(liquid:1) that can
be used within the individual CVFs.
The verb entries are linked to the Czech and
Princeton WordNet 2.0, i.e. they are organized
around the respective lemma in synsets with
numbered senses.
The Czech lexical resource being now developed is
then a list of Czech CVFs – this work is going on
within the Verbalex project at FI MU (Hlaváčková,
Horák, 2005). Verbalex now contains approx.
11000 verb literals organized in synsets. The
current goal is to enlarge the lexicon to 15 000
verbs.
The inventory of the semantic roles we work with
clearly represents a sort of ontology which tries to
cover word stock of Czech verbs and can be used
as a base for a semantic classification and
subclassification of the verbs. The ontologies
represent theoretical constructs designed from the
„top“ and as such they are not directly based on the
empirical evidence, i.e. corpus data. Thus there is a
need to confront the ontologies and the inventories
of the semantic roles that can be derived from them
with the corpus data and see how well they can
correspond to them. For this purpose we are
experimenting with the corpus data obtained from
the Word Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff, Rychlý,
Smrž, Tugwell 2006).

4 Logical Analysis Using CVFs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997593333333333">
In this section we describe the translation of
VerbaLex CVFs into a verb phrase, which is a core
of a sentence logical analysis.
TIL comes with a dissociation of significant verbs
into two groups according to the classification of
their meaning:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.770664">
1. by attributive verbs we ascribe qualities or
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999562027777778">
properties to objects. Attributive verbs are
typically expressed by the respective form
of the verb ‘to be’ combined with an
expression denoting a property; examples:
‘to be red’ or ‘to be mellow’ or with a
general substantive like ‘to be a traitor’, ‘to
be a tree’.
2. episodic verbs, on the other hand, specify
actions performed by a subject.
An episodic verb does not describe its subject&apos;s
state in any moment of time, it rather describes an
episode of doing something at the certain time
moment (and necessarily some time before that
moment plus the expectation that it will last also in
the next few moments, at least). 97L provides a
complex handling of episodic verbs including the
verb tense, aspect (perfective/imperfective) or
active/passive state. All these features are
concentrated around the so called verbal object, the
construction of which (i.e., the meaning of a
particular verb phrase) is the application of (the
construction of) the verb to (the constructions of)
the verb&apos;s arguments.
Since the analysis of attributive verbs is usually
quite simple, we will concentrate in the following
text on the examples of selected episodic verbs
from VerbaLex and their logical analysis using the
complex valency frames.
The TIL type of episodic verbal objects is
(o(on)(on))w, where n is the type of propositions
(o,w). See (Horák 2002, pp. 64-73) and (Tichý
1980) for detailed explanation. Our analysis is
driven by a linguistic (syntactic) context that
signals the semantic fact that there is always a
function involved here, so that we have to ascribe
types to its arguments and value.

4.1 Examples of Logical Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.896162333333333">
We have chosen cca 10 verbs with their verb
frames from VerbaLex and we will use them as
examples of the algorithm for determining the verb
type in the TIL logical analysis procedure.
dát (give)
dát:2 / dávat:2 / darovat:1 / věnovat:1 (give:8,
gift:2, present:7)
obl
-frame: DON&lt;organization:1&gt;what_nom VERBobl
OBJ&lt;object:1&gt;what_accobl
BEN&lt;person:1&gt;to_whom_datobl
-example: firma věnovala zaměstnancům nová auta
(a company gave new cars to the employees)
-use: prim
The verb arguments in this frame are: who, to
whom, what (all obligatory) with (at least) two
options: a) to whom is an individual, b) to whom is
a class of individuals. The respective verb types
are ad a): ((o(on)(on))wttt),
ad b): ((o(on)(on))wt(ot)t).
For example to whom = to the employees of a
given institution. To be an employee of the
institution XY is a property, say Z / (ot),w. So “The
company gave to the employees of XY...“, not
taking into account grammatical tenses and
omitting trivializations we get XwXt [Givewt XY
Zwt etc.] (XY has the type t here, being a collective
rather than a class.)
With this example, we can show that CVFs are
used not only for determining the verbal object
type, but also for stating additional prerequisities
(necessary conditions) for the sentence
constituents. The full analysis using the verb frame
above thus contains, except the verb phrase part,
the conditions saying that “X gives Y to Z n
organization(X) n object(Y) n person(Z)”. The
predicates organization, object and person here
represent the properties denoted by the
corresponding terms in the wordnet hypero-
hyponymical hierarchy.

If I cry because of, for etc., then the role of causing
is played by this because of. Crying is an episodic
verb, whereas because of etc. is a relation between
propositions, often between events. We have
therefore because of / (οππ)τω, where the first
π(=οτω) belongs to the proposition denoted, e.g., by
clothes have been spoiled or that the respective
individual is poor, sinful etc., and the second π to
the proposition that the respective individual cries.
In case of to cry for somebody the respective type
is again a “relation” ((ο(οπ)(οπ))ωιι), although this
for hides some cause, which is, however, not
mentioned.
With this verb, we will describe the analysis of
verb entailment handling in TIL. If we analyse a

This verb’s type is a verbal object without
arguments, (ο(οπ)(οπ))ω. In addition to this the
following rule holds: If X cries because of... or X
cries for..., then X cries. In this way the semantic
dependence between the three cases of crying is
given; otherwise we would not be able to detect
this connection, e.g. between brečet1 and brečet2.

If understood as in “What does (s)he live off? (S)he
teaches.” it is the case of cry3 (see above). To
teach understood as in “He teaches history,
maths”, etc., the analysis depends on which type is
given to the school subjects, disciplines. One
possibility is to analyse them as properties of a set
of propositions, (ο(οπ))τω. Then to teach receives
the type ((ο(οπ)(οπ))ωι(ο(οπ))τω). If “teaches
alphabet” is the case then we have to decide what
we mean by alphabet. Here the point is to teach
(learn) to associate symbols and sounds
(phonemes?), so the respective type of alphabet is
(αβ), where α is the type of symbols, β the type of
sounds. In the analysis of “to educate somebody in
something” the verb takes an individual as its
additional argument: ((ο(οπ)(οπ))ωιια), where α is
the type of the discipline.
In all the examples, we have displayed the
relations between the two-level semantic roles used
in the VerbaLex verb frames and the resulting
logical analysis types of the verbal object as the
main part of the clause’s logical construction. The
algorithmisation of this procedure uses a list of all
roles used in the lexicon (there are about 200 roles
used) with the corresponding (ambiguous) logical
types of the constituents. In this way we can form a
basic skeleton of the automatic translation of text
to logical constructions.

<bodyText confidence="0.9873199">
The paper presented a first outline of comparison
and integration of the two approaches, namely
logical and linguistic, to the semantics of verbs in a
natural language (English and Czech). We are
aware that this work is still in a great progress and
the results so presented rather fragmentary. Still,
we are convinced that the research project we aim
at is a relevant contribution to the semantics of
natural language.

We have shown that pursuing such a research is
reasonable and comes up with a new viewpoint to
the meaning of verbs. In this way we extend our
knowledge in the important way. Actually, we are
dealing with two deep levels of the meaning
description and a question may be asked which one
is deeper and better. Our answer is, do not contrast
the two levels, and make use of both of them. In
this way we believe to integrate them into one
compact whole and perhaps obtain a unique data
structure. The results of the presented research can
be immediately applied in the area of knowledge
representation and in the long-term Normal
Translation System project that is being prepared.
We have not tackled the other deep descriptions,
such as the method that exploits the
tectogramatical level as it is presently applied in
PDT (Hajič 2004). This, obviously, is a topic of
another paper.

<abstract confidence="0.999393037037037">In the paper, we describe methods for exploitation of a new lexical database of valency frames (VerbaLex) in relation to Transparent Intensional Logic (TIL). We present a detailed description of the Complex Valency Frames (CVF) as they appear in VerbaLex including basic ontology of the VerbaLex semantic roles. TIL is a typed logical system developed for natural language semantic representation using TIL logical forms known as constructions. TIL is well suited to handle the difficult language phenomena such as temporal relations, intensionality and propositional attitudes. Here we make use of the long-term development of the Normal Translation Algorithm aimed at automatic translation of natural language sentences into TIL constructions. We examine the relations between CVFs and TIL constructions of predicateargument structures and discuss the procedure of automatic acquisition of the verbal object constructions. The exploitation of CVFs in the syntactic parsing is also briefly mentioned.</abstract>

In Section 4 we adduce an example of the analysis of selected English and Czech verbs for which the above mentioned integration has been proposed. 2 Basics of Transparent Intensional Logic In this Section we provide an introductory explanation of the main notions of Transparent Intensional Logic (TIL). For exact definitions and details see, e.g., Tichý (1988), Tichý (2004), Materna (1998), Materna (2004) and Materna, Duží (2005). TIL approach to knowledge representation can be characterised as the ‘topdown approach’. TIL ‘generalises to the hardest case’ and obtains the ‘less hard cases’ by lifting various restrictions that apply only higher up. This way of proceeding is opposite to how semantic theories tend to be built up. The standard approach (e.g. predicate logic) consists in beginning with atomic sentences, then proceeding to molecular sentences formed by means of truth-functional connectives or by quantifiers, and from there to sentences containing modal operators and, </context>

To this end we first present a brief survey of the logic we are going to use, namely Transparent Intensional Logic (TIL), which was originated by P. Tichý (Tichý 1988). Theoretical aspects of TIL were further developed in particular by P. Materna (Materna 1998) and also by co-authors of this paper (see, Materna, Duží 2005, Horák 2002). A question may be asked why we do not exploit first order predicate logic (PL1) where some of the presented problems have already been explored and PL1 has been used to represent logical forms. It is a well established fact that PL1 is not able to handle systematically the phenomena like propositional verbs (which, of course, appear in our valency frames), grammatical tenses and modalities (modal verbs and modal particles in natural language). On the other hand, since TIL works with types these problems either do not arise or they can be solved in an intuitive way (see Tichý 1988). In the se</context>

All these features are concentrated around the so called verbal object, the construction of which (i.e., the meaning of a particular verb phrase) is the application of (the construction of) the verb to (the constructions of) the verb&apos;s arguments. Since the analysis of attributive verbs is usually quite simple, we will concentrate in the following text on the examples of selected episodic verbs from VerbaLex and their logical analysis using the complex valency frames. The TIL type of episodic verbal objects is (o(on)(on))w, where n is the type of propositions (o,w). See (Horák 2002, pp. 64-73) and (Tichý 1980) for detailed explanation. Our analysis is driven by a linguistic (syntactic) context that signals the semantic fact that there is always a function involved here, so that we have to ascribe types to its arguments and value. 4.1 Examples of Logical Analysis We have chosen cca 10 verbs with their verb frames from VerbaLex and we will use them as examples of the algorithm for determining the verb type in the TIL logical analysis procedure. dát (give) dát:2 / dávat:2 / darovat:1 / věnovat:1 (give:8, gift:2, present:7) obl -frame: DON&lt;organization:1&gt;what_nom VERBobl OB</context>

Motivation for the VerbaLex project came from comparing Czech WordNet verb frames with VALLEX. The main goal of VerbaLex is an automatic processing of verb phrases exploiting explicit links to Princeton WordNet. The complex valency frames we are working with can be characterized as data structures (tree graphs) describing predicateargument structure of a verb which contains the verb itself and the arguments determined by the verb meaning (their number usually varies from 1- 5). The argument structure also displays the semantic preferences on the arguments. On the syntactic (surface) level t</context>

The exploitation of CVFs in the syntactic parsing is also briefly mentioned. 1 Introduction In the paper we propose a method to integrate the logical analysis of sentences with the linguistic approach to semantics, exploiting the complex valency frames (CVFs) in the VerbaLex verb 97 valency lexicon, see (Hlaváčková, Horák, Kadlec 2006). To this end we first present a brief survey of the logic we are going to use, namely Transparent Intensional Logic (TIL), which was originated by P. Tichý (Tichý 1988). Theoretical aspects of TIL were further developed in particular by P. Materna (Materna 1998) and also by co-authors of this paper (see, Materna, Duží 2005, Horák 2002).

Since the analysis of attributive verbs is usually quite simple, we will concentrate in the following text on the examples of selected episodic verbs from VerbaLex and their logical analysis using the complex valency frames. The TIL type of episodic verbal objects is (o(on)(on))w, where n is the type of propositions (o,w). See (Horák 2002, pp. 64-73) and (Tichý 1980) for detailed explanation. Our analysis is driven by a linguistic (syntactic) context that signals the semantic fact that there is always a function involved here, so that we have to ascribe types to its arguments and value. 4.1 Examples of Logical Analysis We have chosen cca 10 verbs with their verb frames from VerbaLex and we will use them as examples of the algorithm for determining the verb type in the TIL logical analysis procedure. dát (give) dát:2 / dávat:2 / darovat:1 / věnovat:1 (give:8, gift:2, present:7) obl -frame: DON&lt;organization:1&gt;what_nom VERBobl OBJ&lt;object:1&gt;what_accobl BEN&lt;pe</context>

A quintessence of such a polymorphism: think on (about) ― one can think of an object of any kind. učit (teach) naučit:1 / učit:2 / vyučovat:1 (teach:1, learn:5, instruct:1) 4 see (Horák 2002, p. 65) and (Tichý 1980). obl -frame: AG&lt;person:1&gt;who_nom VERBobl PAT&lt;person:1&gt;whom_acc opt obl KNOW&lt;subject:3&gt; what acc,to_ what _dat -example: naučil dítě abecedu (he educated a children in the alphabet) -example: učí studenty matematiku (he teaches mathematics for students) -example: vyučuje dějepisu (he/she teaches history) -use: prim If understood as in “What does (s)he live off?

Often denoted by concatenation of a superlative and a noun (“the highest mountain”). Individual roles correspond to what Church calls an “individual concept”. 3 The Complex Valency Frames Valency frames have been built in several projects (VALLEX for Czech PDT (Žabokrtský 2005) or VerbNet (Kipper et al 2006)). Motivation for the VerbaLex project came from comparing Czech WordNet verb frames with VALLEX. The main goal of VerbaLex is an automatic processing of verb phrases exploiting explicit links to Princeton WordNet. The complex valency frames we are working with can be characterized as data structures (tree graphs) describing predicateargument structure of a verb which contains the verb itself and the arguments determined by the verb meaning (their number usually varies from 1- 5). The argument structure also displays the semantic preferences on the arguments. On </context>
