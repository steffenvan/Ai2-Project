1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936714285714">
In biomedical texts, contradictions about protein-
protein interactions (PPIs) occur when an author
reports observing a given PPI whereas another au-
thor argues that very same interaction does not take
place: e.g., when author X argues that “protein A
interacts with protein B” whereas author Y claims
that “protein A does not interact with B”. Of
course, merely discovering a potential contradic-
tion does not mean the argument is closed as other
factors may have caused the proteins to behave in
different ways. We present preliminary work to-
wards the automatic detection of potential contra-
dictions between PPIs from text and an agreement
experimental evaluation of our method.

2 Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999895421052632">
Our method consists of the following steps: i) ex-
tract positive and negative cases of PPIs and map
them to a semantic structure; ii) compare the pairs
of PPIs structures that contain similar canonical
protein names iii) apply an inference method to the
selected pair of PPIs.
We extract positive and negative cases of PPIs
by applying our system (Sanchez &amp; Poesio, sub-
mitted). Our system considers proteins only as well
as events where only one protein participates (e.g.
“PI-3K activity”). The system produces the seman-
tic interpretation shown in Table 1. We manually
corrected some of the information extracted in or-
der to compare exclusively our inference method
with human annotators.
The decision to determine if a C-PPI holds is
given by the context. This context is formed by the
combination of semantic components such as PPI
polarity, verb direction, and manner polarity.

As a way of evaluation, we compared agreement
between our method and human annotators by us-
ing the kappa measure (Siegel and Castellan,
1998). We elaborated a test containing only of 31
pairs of sentences (JBC articles) since this task can
be tiring for human annotators.
The test consisted on classifying the pairs of
sentences into three categories: contradiction (C),
no contradiction (NC) and unsure (U). The values
of kappa obtained are presented in the following
table.

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999943">
We have presented a simple method to detect po-
tential contradictions of PPIs by using context ex-
pressed by semantics and linguistics constituents
(e.g. modals, verbs, adverbs, etc). Our method
showed to perform similarly to biologists and bet-
ter than non-biologists. Interestingly, biologists
concluded that C-PPIs are rarely found; neverthe-
less, the cases found may be highly significant.
Continuing with our work, we will try our sys-
tem in a larger set of data.
