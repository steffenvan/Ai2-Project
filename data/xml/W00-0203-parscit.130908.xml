IF (Interchange Format), the interlingua used by
the C-STAR consortium, is a speech-act based in-
terlingua for task-oriented dialogue. IF was de-
signed as a practical interlingua that could strike
a balance between expressivity and simplicity. If
it is too simple, components of meaning will be
lost and coverage of unseen data will be low. On
the other hand, if it is too complex, it cannot be
used with a high degree of consistency by collab-
orators on different continents. In this paper, we
suggest methods for evaluating the coverage of IF
and the consistency with which it was used in the
C-STAR consortium.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999200095238095">
IF (Interchange Format) is an interlingua used by
the C-STAR consortiuml for task-oriented dia-
logues. Because it is used in five different coun-
tries for six different languages, it had to achieve
a careful balance between being expressive enough
and being simple enough to be used consistently.
If it was not expressive enough, components of
meaning would be lost and coverage of unseen data
would be low. On the other hand, if was not sim-
ple enough, different system developers would use
it inconsistently and the wrong meanings would be
translated. IF is described in our previous papers
([PT98, LGIN98, LLW1).
For this paper, we have proposed methods for
evaluating the coverage of IF and the degree to
which it can be used consistently across C-STAR
sites. Coverage was measured by having human IF
specialists annotate unseen data. Consistency was
measured by two means. The first was inter-coder
agreement among IF specialists at Carnegie Mel-
Lon University and ITC-irst (Centro per la ricerca

scientifica e tecnologica). The second, less direct
method, was a cross-site end-to-end evaluation of
English-to-Italian translation where the English-
to-IF analysis grammars were written at CMU and
IF-to-Italian generation was developed at IRST. If
the English and Italian grammar writers did not
agree on the meaning of the IF, wrong transla-
tions will be produced. In this way, the cross-site
evaluation can be an indirect indicator of whether
the CMU and IRST IF specialists agreed on the
meaning of IF representations. For comparison,
we also present within-site end-to-end evaluations
of English-to-German, English-to-Japanese, and
English-to-1F-to-English, where all of the analysis
and generation grammars were written at CMU.
The Interchange Format
Because we are working with task-oriented dia-
logues, adequate rendering of the speech act in the
target language often overshadows the need for lit-
eral translation of the words. IF is therefore based
on domain actions (DAs), which consist of on
speech acts plus domain-specific concepts. An ex-
ample of a DA is give-information+price+room
(giving information about the price of a room).
DAs are composed from 45 general speech acts
(e.g., acknowledge, give-information, accept)
and about 96 domain-specific concepts (e.g,
price, temporal, room, flight, availability).
In addition to the IDA, IF representations can con-
tain arguments such as room-type, destination,
and price. There are about 119 argument types.
In the following example, the DA consists
of a speaker tag (a: for agent), the speech-
act give-information, and two main concepts,
+price and +room. The DA is followed by a list
of arguments: room-type= and price=. The ar-
guments have values that represent information
for the type of room double and the cost repre-

Coverage and Distribution of

<bodyText confidence="0.983748490566038">
In this section, we address the coverage of IF for
task-oriented dialogues about travel planning. We
want to know whether a very simple interlingua
like IF can have good coverage. We are using a
rather subjective measure of coverage: IF experts
hand-tagged unseen data with IF representations
and counted the percentage of utterances to which
no IF could be assigned. (When they tagged the
unseen data, they were not told that the IF was
being tested for coverage. The tagging was done
for system development purposes.) Our end-to-
end evaluation described in the following sections
can be taken as a less subjective measure of cov-

erage. However, the score of an end-to-end evalu-
ation encompasses grammar coverage problems as
well as IF coverage problems.
The development portion of the coverage ex-
periment proceeded as follows. Over a period of
two years, a database of travel planning dialogues
was collected by C-STAR partners in the U.S.,
Italy, and Korea. The dialogues were role-playing
dialogues between a person pretending to be a
traveller and a person pretending to be a travel
agent. For the English and Italian dialogues, the
traveller and agent were talking face-to-face in the
same language - both speaking English or both
speaking Italian. The Korean dialogues were also
role playing dialogues, but one participant was
speaking Korean and the other was speaking En-
glish. From these dialogues, only the Korean ut-
terances are included in the database. Each utter-
ance in the database is annotated with an English
translation and an IF representation. Table 1 sum-
marizes the amount of data in each language. The
English, Italian, and Korean data was used for IF
development.
The development database contains over 4000
dialogue act units, which are covered by a total of
about 542 distinct DAs (346 agent DAs and 278
client DAs). Figures 1 and .2 show the cumulative
coverage of the top twenty DA&apos;s and speech acts
in the development data. Figure 1 also shows the
percentage of no-tag utterances (the ones we de-
cided not to cover) in the development data. The
first column shows the percent of the development
data that is covered cumulatively by the DA&apos;s or

rent line. For example, acknowledge and affirm

third column shows the number of times each DA

The evaluation portion of the coverage ex-
periment was carried out on 124 dialogues (6069
dialogue act units) that were collected at ATR,
Japan. One participant in each dialogue was
speaking Japanese and the other was speaking En-
glish. Both Japanese and English utterances are
included in the data. The 124 Japanese-English
dialogues were not examined closely by system de-
velopers during IF development. After the IF de-
sign was finalized and frozen in Summer 1999, the
Japanese-English data was tagged with IFs. No
further IF development took place at this point
except that values for arguments were added. For
example, Mayako could be added as a hotel name,
but no new speech acts, concepts, or argument
types could be added. Sentences were tagged as
no-tag if the IF did not cover them.
Figures 3 and 4 show the cumulative cover-

age of the top twenty DAs and speech acts in the
Japanese-English data, including the percent of
no-tag sentences.
Notice that the percentage of no-tag was
lower in our test data than in our development
data. This is because the role playing instructions
for the test data were more restrictive than the
role playing instructions for the development data.
Figures 1 and 3 show that slightly more of the test
data is covered by slightly fewer DAs.

C-STAR partners. We used 84 DA units from
the Japanese-English data described above. The
84 DA units consisted of some coherent dialogue
fragments and and some isolated sentences. The
data was coded at CMU and at IRST. We counted
agreement on the components of the IF separately.
Table 2 shows agreement on speech acts, dialogue
acts (speech act plus concepts), concepts, and ar-
guments. The results are reported in Table 2 in
terms of percent agreement. Further work might
include some other calculation of agreement such
as Kappa or precision and recall of the coders
against each other. Figure 5 shows a fragment of
a dialogue coded by CMU and IRST. The coders
disagreed on the IF middle sentence, Pd like a twin
room please. One coded it as an acceptance of a
twin room, the other coded it as a preference for
a twin room.
Cross-Site Evaluation: As an approximate and
indirect measure of consistency, we have compared
intra-site end-to-end evaluation with cross-site
end-to-end evaluation. An end-to-end evaluation
includes an analyzer, which maps the source lan-
guage input into IF and a generator, which maps
IF into target language sentences. The intra-site
evaluation was carried out on English-German,
English-Japanese, and English-IF-English trans-
lation. The English analyzer and the German,
Japanese, and English generators were all writ-
ten at CMU by IF experts who worked closely
with each other. The cross-site evaluation was car-
ried out on English-Italian translation, involving
an English analyzer written at CMU and an Ital-
ian generator written at IRST. The IF experts at
CMU and IRST were in occasional contact with
each other by email, and met in person two or
three times between 1997 and 1999.
A number of factors contribute to the success
of an inter-site evaluation, just one of which is that
the sites used IF consistently with each other. An-
other factor is that the two sites used similar de-
velopment data and have approximately the same
coverage. lithe inter-site evaluation results are
about as good as the intra-site results, we can con-
dude that all factors are handled acceptably, in-
cluding consistency of IF usage. If the inter-site
results are worse than the intra-site results, con-
sistency of IF use or some other factor may be
to blame. Before conducting this evaluation, we
already knew that there was some degree of cross-
site consistency in IF usage because we conducted
successful inter-continental demos with speech
translation and video conferencing in Summer
1999. (The demos and some of the press coverage
are reported on the C-STAR web site.) The de-
mos included dialogues in English-Italian, English-
German,English-Japanese, English-Korean and
English-French. At a later date, an Italian-Korean
demo was produced with no additional work, thus
illustrating the well-cited advantage of an inter-
lingual approach in a multi-lingual situation. The
end-to-end evaluation reported here goes beyond
the demo situation to include data that was un-
seen by system developers.
Evaluation Data: The Summer 1999 intra-site
evaluation was conducted on about 130 utterances
from a CMU user study. The traveller was played
by a second time user — someone who had partici-
pated in one previous user study, but had no other
experience with our MT system. The travel agent
was played by a system developer. Both people
were speaking English, but they were in different
rooms, and their utterances were paraphrased us-
ing IF. The end-to-end procedure was that (1) an
English utterance was spoken and decoded by the
JANUS speech recognizer, (2) the output of the rec-
ognizer was parsed into an IF representation, and
(3) a different English utterance (supposedly with
the same meaning) was generated from the IF rep-
resentation. The speakers had no other means of
communication with each other.
In order to evaluate English-German and
English-Japanese translation, the IFs of the 130
test sentences were fed into German and Japanese
generation components at CMU. The data used in
the evaluation was unseen by system developers
at the time of the evaluation. For English-Italian
translation, the IF representations produced by
the English analysis component were sent to MST
to be generated in Italian.
Evaluation Scoring: In order to score the eval-
uation, input and output sentences were compared
by bilingual people, or monolingual people in the
case of English-IF-English evaluation. A score of
ok is assigned if the target language utterance is
comprehensible and no components of meaning are
deleted, added, or changed by the translation. A

the results were graded by researchers at IRST.
Comparing Rows 6 and 7 with Rows 8 and 9, we
can check that CMU and IRST graders were us-
ing roughly the same grading criteria: a difference
of up to ten percent among graders is normal in
our experience. Rows 111 and 11 show the results
of the inter-site English-Italian evaluation. The

<abstract confidence="0.978973642857143">IF (Interchange Format), the interlingua used by the C-STAR consortium, is a speech-act based infor task-oriented dialogue. IF designed as a practical interlingua that could strike a balance between expressivity and simplicity. If it is too simple, components of meaning will be lost and coverage of unseen data will be low. On the other hand, if it is too complex, it cannot be used with a high degree of consistency by collaborators on different continents. In this paper, we for evaluating the coverage of IF and the consistency with which it was used in the C-STAR consortium.</abstract>
