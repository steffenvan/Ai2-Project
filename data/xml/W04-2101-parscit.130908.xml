Kanji dictionaries, which need to present a
large number of complex characters in an
order that makes them accessible by users,
traditionally use several indexing techniques
that are particularly suited to the printed
medium. Electronic dictionary technology
provides the opportunity of both introducing
new indexing techniques that are not
feasible with printed dictionaries, and also
allowing a wide range of index methods
with each dictionary. It also allows
dictionaries to be interfaced at the character
level with documents and applications, thus
removing much of the requirement for
complex index methods. This paper surveys
the traditional indexing methods, introduces
some of the new indexing techniques that
have become available with electronic kanji
dictionaries, and reports on an analysis of
the index usage patterns in a major WWW-
based electronic kanji dictionary. This is
believed to be the first such analysis
conducted and reported.

<bodyText confidence="0.999713166666667">
Unlike languages written in alphabetic,
syllabic or similar scripts, languages such as
Japanese and Chinese, which are written
using a large number of characters: hanzi in
Chinese, kanji in Japanese, require two
distinct sets of dictionaries. These are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6077527">
a. the traditional &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; dictionaries,
as used in most recorded languages. Such
dictionaries are usually ordered in some
recognized phonetic sequence, and typically
include the pronunciation or reading of the
word as well as the usual dictionary
components: part-of-speech, explanation.
etc.
b. character dictionaries, which
typically have an entry for each character,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995985173913044">
and contain such information as the
classification of the character according to
shape, usage, components, etc., the
pronunciation or reading of the character,
variants of the character, the meaning or
semantic application of the character, and
often a selection of words demonstrating the
use of the character in the language&apos;s
orthography. These dictionaries are usually
ordered on some visual characteristic of the
characters.
A typical learner of Japanese needs to have
both forms of dictionary, and the process of
&amp;quot;looking up&amp;quot; an unknown word often
involves initially using the character
dictionary to determine the pronunciation of
one or more of the characters, then using
that pronunciation as an index to a word
dictionary, in a process that can be time-
consuming and error-prone.
The advent of electronic dictionaries has had
a considerable impact on Japanese
dictionary usage:

dictionaries such that a user can index

the author in the early 1990s (Breen, 1995),
and is now a common feature of almost all
hand-held electronic Japanese dictionaries
and PC-based dictionary packages;

words between text documents and
dictionary software, thus removing the

2 Indexing a Kanji Dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965679450549451">
The general problem confronting the
publication of kanji dictionaries is the large
number of kanji in use and the absence of an
intrinsic and recognized lexical order for
kanji. In the post-war educational reforms in
Japan, the number of kanji taught in schools
was restricted to a basic 1,850, which has
now been increased to 1,945. This set of
kanji, along with a small set designated for
use in personal names, accounts for all but a
small proportion of kanji usage in modern
Japanese. Many dictionaries and similar
reference books compiled for students are
based on this set (Sakade, 1961; Henshall,
1988; Halpern, 1999; etc.). The main
computer character-set standard used in
Japan, JIS X 0208 (JIS, 1997), which
extends to less-common kanji including
those used in places-names, has 6,355 kanji.
This set is the basis for several kanji
dictionaries (Nelson, 1997; Spahn &amp;
Hadamitzky, 1996), while larger sets of
kanji are covered in many dictionaries, e.g.
the Kodansha Daijiten (Ueda, 1963) has
14,900 kanji and the 13-volume Morohashi
Daikanwajiten (Morohashi, 1989) has over
45,000 kanji.
In this paper, the term &amp;quot;primary index&amp;quot; has
been used for the method of ordering the
kanji entries, and &amp;quot;secondary index&amp;quot; has
been used for cross-reference lists of kanji
based on alternative ordering systems.
The major traditional indexing technique for
kanji and hanzi dictionaries has been the
radical system (bushu in Japanese), based on
214 elements plus about 150 variants. These
elements are graphic components of the
character that occur frequently enough to be
used for indexing purposes. For example,
the kanji # (mura: village) is identified by
the * radical, and in a dictionary would be
grouped with other kanji identified by that
radical (�L, X77, �, *, etc.), with the
grouped kanji ordered by the number of
strokes in the remainder of the kanji. Radical
systems have been used in Chinese character
dictionaries for nearly 2,000 years, and the
dominant 214-radical system was first used
in the 1 HKMA (kangxi zidian) published in
1716.
Virtually all major kanji dictionaries
published in Japan use the radical indexing
method as the primary index, as do a
number of dictionaries published elsewhere.
Some dictionaries use modified or reduced
sets of radicals. The technique is not simple
to use, and some skill and practice is
required in correctly identifying the radical
and counting the residual strokes. The
difficulty has been compounded by recent
simplifications of the glyphs of the kanji,
which in some cases have modified or
eliminated the radical.
There are a number of other techniques used
for indexing kanji in a dictionary:
a. reading. The reading or
pronunciation of a kanji is a common and
useful method of identification, and virtually
all kanji dictionaries have a separate
reading/kanji index. The reading cannot be
used effectively as the primary index, as in
Japanese each kanji usually has two sets of
readings, and some kanji have as many as
fifteen distinct readings.
b. shape/stroke. A number of
techniques have been used to decompose the
shape of a kanji according to coded patterns.
One, which was popular in China, is the
Four-Corner code, which allocates a number
(0-9) to the pattern of strokes at each corner
of the character, leading to a four-digit
index. Another method, which is quite
popular, is the SKIP (System of Kanji
Indexing by Patterns) used by Jack Halpern
in his kanji dictionaries (Halpern, 1990,
1999). In this, a kanji is typically divided
into two portions, and a code constructed
from the division type and the stroke-counts
in the portions. Thus # has a SKIP code of
1-4-3, indicating a vertical division into four
and three-stroke portions.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.875710235294118">
c. school grade. In Japan the kanji to
be taught in each grade of elementary school
are prescribed, and some references either
organize kanji in those groupings or provide
a secondary index of grades.
d. stroke count. The number of pen or
brush strokes making up a kanji, ranging
from one to over forty, can be an effective
indexing technique, particularly for the
simpler kanji. Some dictionaries employ a
secondary index using the total number of
strokes in a kanji.
e. frequency. The ranking of kanji
according to frequency-of-use can be a
useful secondary index, especially for the
commonly used kanji.
f. code-point. The standardization of
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9625879">
character set code-points for kanji has led to
the emergence of dictionaries with these as
the primary index. The Sanseido Unicode
Kanji Information Dictionary (Tanaka,
2000) uses the Unicode code-point as the
primary index, and the first edition of the
JIS Kanji Dictionary (Shibano, 1997) used
the JIS X 0208 code-point. It is interesting
to note that the second edition (Shibano,
2002) changed to the traditional radical
system, with the codepoints being relegated
to a secondary index.
A summary of the indices available in a
selection of dictionaries and references is in
Table 1. The &amp;quot;P&amp;quot; indicates the primary index
and an &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; indicates a secondary index. (The
original Nelson uses a slightly modified
version of the traditional radical index, and
the Spahn &amp; Hadamitzky Kanji Dictionary
uses a simplified 79-radical system.

As mentioned above, electronic kanji
dictionaries have an increased number of
indexing methods available, and in
particular have navigational advantages over
traditional paper dictionaries:
a. the concept of a &amp;quot;secondary&amp;quot; index
no longer applies, as every index is capable
of linking directly to the kanji entries;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.861362">
b. dictionary users can choose flexibly

preference, and can select a method

index directly to a kanji entry from a kanji
selected from a text or application;

<bodyText confidence="0.913852387096774">
Among the new indexing methods
introduced with electronic kanji dictionaries
are:
a. indexing using the meaning of a
kanji. The compilation of the KANJIDIC
database (Breen 2004), which contains the
English meanings for over 12,000 kanji, has
enabled this technique to be employed.
Searching for kanji meaning &amp;quot;castle&amp;quot;
immediately gives JA, &amp;quot;fox&amp;quot; gives a, etc.
b. multi-radical searching. Most kanji
are made up of several basic shapes drawn
from a set of about 300 patterns. For
example, the kanji off (atarashii: new)
consists of the A, � and Fr patterns.
Clearly, a traditional dictionary can only use
one of these as an index (the index radical of
off is Fr) but an electronic dictionary can use
all the patterns to identify a kanji. A file of
the visual components of the 6,355 kanji in
the JIS X 0208 standard was prepared by a
team of volunteers and is currently
maintained by the author. The patterns used
are similar to the traditional 214 radicals, but
include common shapes such as --i- and �
that are not among the 214, and
distinguishes between shapes such as A and
A that are regarded as variants of the same
radical. The following is an extract from the
file of kanji with the radical components
identified.

New indexing techniques, such as those
described above, have to date been largely
confined to non-commercial packages based
on the author&apos;s KANJIDIC project files
(Breen, 2004). The commercial electronic
kanji dictionaries in Japan, which are
typically based on published kanji
dictionaries, usually only provide radical,
reading and occasionally stroke-count
indices.

4 Usage Patterns in an Electronic Kanji
Dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999803787234043">
The availability of a large range of indexing
techniques in an electronic kanji dictionary
raises the question of how useful they
actually are to users of such dictionaries, and
which methods are preferred by users. With
dictionaries provided as software packages,
measurement of the usage of the differing
indexing techniques would be limited to
such things as surveys of users. To date no
analysis appears to have been carried out on
user preferences in indexing methods.
One form of electronic kanji dictionary
which is amenable to the direct
measurement of usage patterns is the kanji
dictionary component of WWW-based
Japanese dictionary, such as the WWWJDIC
server (Breen, 2003) developed by the
author. The WWWJDIC server provides
over twenty indices to its database of over
13,000 kanji, including all the techniques
mentioned earlier in this paper. The users
are primarily students of Japanese and non-
native speakers of Japanese.
The server code at the Monash University
site was extended to provide detailed
statistics of the accesses to the kanji
dictionary module. Information was
collected over a two-week period, during
which time over 70,000 accesses to the kanji
dictionary were made. Table 2 contains a
breakdown of the accesses by index type. In
the case of accesses using the multi-radical
method, it is clear that users frequently have
to make several selections of radicals to
reach the correct kanji. From inspection of
the raw statistics, it appeared that on average
three accesses were made by each user of
this method for each target kanji.
Accordingly, the reported accesses for this
method have been reduced to make a more
meaningful comparison with the other
methods. The &amp;quot;Direct&amp;quot; method involves
access to the kanji in a word encountered in
another dictionary function, whereas the
&amp;quot;Cut-Paste&amp;quot; method refers to kanji
transferred from another WWW page or
application.

(In 20.3% of the accesses recorded in Table
2, the user opted to make a follow-on search
of one of the &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; dictionaries on the
server using a kanji as a search key.)
These results are interesting for a number of
reasons:
a. the index methods which dominate
are either those which have only become
available with electronic dictionaries: multi-
radical, direct access, English meaning, etc.,
or those which can only be used via a
secondary index in traditional dictionaries.
b. the high levels of access based on
the code-points of the kanji, which includes
the Direct, Cut-Paste and Code-Point
methods is an indication of the usefulness of
operating an electronic dictionary in
association with other software. The
relatively high result for the Code-Point
method, which involves supplying the server
with the hexadecimal representation of the
kanji&apos;s code, was investigated further. Over
60% of these accesses used the Unicode
code-point, and on inspection of the server
logs it transpired that most arrived as
linkages from other WWW servers and
database collections dealing with kanji and
hanzi.
c. the relatively low usage of the
traditional radical index and the SKIP
method is an indication that while they may
be suitable and accepted in paper
dictionaries as the primary indices, they play
only a minor role in electronic dictionaries,
where users clearly find other methods more
useful.
It is recognized that this survey of usage
patterns reflects both the preferences of the
particular set of users who have chosen to
use it, and the biases introduced by the
interface, which in the case of HTML forms
is often not as easily used as, for example, a
tailored GUI. It is, however, a strong
indication of the sorts of indexing methods
which are found to be useful by such a
group. It is also worth noting that despite the
clumsiness of the Multi-radical selection
form, which has over 200 check-boxes, it is
clearly among the most popular kanji index
methods.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948785714286">
Kanji dictionaries have traditionally been
published using indexing techniques
developed for use in the printed medium.
Electronic dictionary techniques provide the
opportunity both to interface such
dictionaries directly with text, and also to
introduce new techniques more suited to the
computer-human interface. Implementation
of such techniques and the subsequent
measurement of their usage in an
environment where users can choose from a
variety of indexing methods indicates a high
level of acceptance of and preference for the
new indexing techniques.

The commercial electronic kanji dictionaries in Japan, which are typically based on published kanji dictionaries, usually only provide radical, reading and occasionally stroke-count indices. 4 Usage Patterns in an Electronic Kanji Dictionary The availability of a large range of indexing techniques in an electronic kanji dictionary raises the question of how useful they actually are to users of such dictionaries, and which methods are preferred by users. With dictionaries provided as software packages, measurement of the usage of the differing indexing techniques would be limited to such thin</context>

Figures 1 and 2 show the GUIs for the bushu and SKIP methods in the kanji dictionary module of the JWPce word-processor (Rosenthal, 2002). Fig. 1: Bushu Lookup GUI Fig. 2: SKIP Lookup GUI Among the new indexing methods introduced with electronic kanji dictionaries are: a. indexing using the meaning of a kanji. The compilation of the KANJIDIC database (Breen 2004), which contains the English meanings for over 12,000 kanji, has enabled this technique to be employed. Searching for kanji meaning &amp;quot;castle&amp;quot; immediately gives JA, &amp;quot;fox&amp;quot; gives a, etc. b. multi-radical searching. Most kanji are made up of several basic shapes drawn from a set of about 300 patterns. For example, the kanji off (atarashii: new) consists of the A, � and Fr pa</context>

A number of techniques have been used to decompose the shape of a kanji according to coded patterns. One, which was popular in China, is the Four-Corner code, which allocates a number (0-9) to the pattern of strokes at each corner of the character, leading to a four-digit index. Another method, which is quite popular, is the SKIP (System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns) used by Jack Halpern in his kanji dictionaries (Halpern, 1990, 1999). In this, a kanji is typically divided into two portions, and a code constructed from the division type and the stroke-counts in the portions. Thus # has a SKIP code of 1-4-3, indicating a vertical division into four and three-stroke portions. c. school grade. In Japan the kanji to be taught in each grade of elementary school are prescribed, and some references either organize kanji in those groupings or provide a secondary index of grades. d. stroke count. The number of pen or brush strokes making up a kanji, ranging from one to over forty, can be an effective indexing technique, part</context>

The main computer character-set standard used in Japan, JIS X 0208 (JIS, 1997), which extends to less-common kanji including those used in places-names, has 6,355 kanji. This set is the basis for several kanji dictionaries (Nelson, 1997; Spahn &amp; Hadamitzky, 1996), while larger sets of kanji are covered in many dictionaries, e.g. the Kodansha Daijiten (Ueda, 1963) has 14,900 kanji and the 13-volume Morohashi Daikanwajiten (Morohashi, 1989) has over 45,000 kanji. In this paper, the term &amp;quot;primary index&amp;quot; has been used for the method of ordering the kanji entries, and &amp;quot;secondary index&amp;quot; has been used for cross-reference lists of kanji based on alternative ordering systems. The major traditional indexing technique for kanji and hanzi dictionaries has been the radical system (bushu in Japanese), based on 214 elements plus about 150 variants. These elements are graphic components of the character that occur frequently enough to be used for indexing purposes. F</context>

A summary of the indices available in a selection of dictionaries and references is in Table 1. The &amp;quot;P&amp;quot; indicates the primary index and an &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; indicates a secondary index.
