INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989369619047619">
We have been developing an English-Japanese
bi-directional machine translation system imple-
mented on a workstation (Amano 1986, Arnano et
a/. 1987). The system, which is interactive and
designed for use by a translator, normally runs in
an interactive mode, and includes a number of spe-
cial bilingual editing functions. We recently real-
ized a real-time on-line communication system
with an automatic translation function by combin-
ing a non-interactive version of our Machine Trans-
lation system with the keyboard conversation func-
tion just like talk in UNIX&amp;quot;. Using this system,
bilingual conversations were held between mem-
bers of our laboratory in Japan and visitors to the
5th World Telecommunications Exhibition Tele-
com 87, organized by the International Telecom-
munication Union, held in Geneva from 20th to
27th October 1987.
In the first part of this paper, we discuss in
detail the configuration of this system, and give
some indications of its performance. In the second
part, we report informally on what for us was an
interesting aspect of the experiment, namely the
nature of the dialogues held using the system. In

particular we were struck by the amount of meta-
dialogue, i.e. dialogue discussing the previous
interchanges: since contributions to the conversa-
tion were being translated, this metadialogue
posed certain problems which we think are of gen-
eral interest. In future systems of a similar
nature, we feel there is a need for users to be
briefly trained in certain conventions regarding
metadialogue, and typical system translation
errors. Furthermore, an environment which mini-
mizes such errors is desirable and the system must
be &apos;tuned&apos; to make translations appropriate to con-
versation.

SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995024961538462">
A general idea of the system is illustrated in
Figure 1. Workstations were situated in Japan and
Switzerland, and linked by a conventional satel-
lite telephone connection. The workstations at
either end were AS3260C machines. Running
UNIX, they support the Toshiba Machine Transla-
tion system AS-TRANSAC. On this occasion, the
Machine Translation capability was installed only
at the Japanese end, though in practice both termi-
nals could run AS-TRANSAC.
The workstation screens are divided into three
windows, as shown in Figure 2, not unlike in the
normal version of UNIX&apos;s talk. The top window
shows the user&apos;s dialogue, the middle window the
correspondent&apos;s replies. The important difference
is that both sides of the dialogue are displayed in
the language appropriate to the location of the ter-
minal. However, in a third small window, a
workspace at the bottom of the screen, the raw
input is also displayed. (This access to the English
input at the Japanese end is significant in the case
of Japanese users having some knowledge of
English, and of course vice versa if appropriate.)
The bottom window also served the purpose of
indicating to the users that their conversation part-
ners were transmitting.

Figure 3 shows the set-up in more detail. At
the Japanese end, the user inputs Japanese at the
keyboard, which is displayed in the upper window
of the workstation screen. The input is passed to
the translation system and the English output,
along with the original input is then transmitted
via telecommunications links (KDD&apos;s Venus-P and
the Swiss PTTs Telepac in this case) to Switzer-
land. There it is processed by the keyboard conver-
sation function, which displays the original input
in the workspace at the bottom of the screen, and
the translated message in the middle window on
the screen. The set-up at the Swiss end is similar
to that at the Japanese end, with the important
exception that only the original input message is
transmitted, since the translation will take place
at the receiving end.

TRANSLATION METHOD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999893913043478">
An input sentence is translated by morphologi-
cal analyzer, dictionary look-up module, parser,
semantic analyzer, and target sentence generator.
Introducing a full-fledged semantic analyzer con-
flicts with avoiding increases in processing time
and memory use. To resolve this conflict, a Lexi-
cal Transition Network Grammar (LTNG) has
been developed for this system.
LTNG provides a semantic framework for an
MT system, at the same time satisfying processing
time and memory requirements. Its main role is to
separate parsing from semantic analysis, i.e., to
make these processes independent of each other. In
LTNG, parsing includes no semantic analysis. Any
ambiguities in an input sentence remain in the syn-
tactic structure of the sentence until processed by
the semantic analyzer. Semantic analysis proceeds
according to a lexical grammar consisting of rules
for converting syntactic structures into semantic
structures. These rules are specific to words in a
pre-compiled lexicon. The lexicon consists of one
hundred thousand entries for both English and
Japanese.

Once the connection has been established, con-
versation proceeds as in UNIX&apos;s talk. An impor-
tant feature of the function is that conversers do
not have to take turns or wait for each other to
fmish typing before replying, unlike with write.
This has a significant effect on conversational
strategy, and occasionally leads to disjointed con-
versations, both in monolingual and bilingual dia-
logues. For example, a user might start to reply
to a message the content of which can be predicted
after the first few words are typed in; or one user
might start to change the topic of conversation
while the other is still typing a reply.
Transmission of input via the satellite was gen-
erally fast enough not to be a problem: the real
bottle-neck was the physical act of input. Novice
users do not attain high speed or accuracy, a prob-
lem exacerbated at the Swiss end by a slow screen
echo. But the problem is even greater for Japanese
input: users typed either in romaji (i.e. using a
standard transcription into the Roman alphabet)
or in hiragana (i.e. using Japanese-syllable values
for the keys). In either case, conversion into kanji
(Chinese characters) is necessary (see Kawada et
al. 1979 and Mori et al. 1983 on kana-to-kanji
conversion); and this conversion is needed for
between a third and a half of the input, on average
(cf. Hayashi 1982:211). Because of the large num-

ber of homophones in Japanese, this can slow
down the speed of input considerably. For exam-
ple, even for professional typists, an input speed
of 100 characters (including conversions) per
minute is considered reasonable (compare expected
speeds of up to 100 words/minute for English typ-
ing). It is of interest to note that this kana-to-
kanji conversion, which is accepted as a normal
part of Japanese word-processor usage, is in fact a
natural form of pre-editing, given that it serves as
a partial disambiguation of the input.
On the other hand, slow typing speeds are also
encountered for English input, one side-effect of
which is the use of abbreviations and shorthand.
In fact, we did not encounter this phenomenon in
Geneva, though in practice sessions (with native
English speakers) in Japan, this had been quite
common. Examples included contractions (e.g.
pis for plea se,.0 for you, cn for can), omis-
sions of apostrophes (e.g. cant, wont, dont)
and non-capitalization (e.g. i, t okyo, j a 1).
The translation time itself did not cause signif-
icant delays compared to the input time, thanks to
a very fast parsing algorithm, which is described
elsewhere (Nogami et al. 1988). Input sentences
were typically rather short (English five to ten
words, Japanese around 20 characters), and transla-
tion was generally about 0.7 seconds per word
(5000 words/hour). Given users&apos; typing speed and
the knowledge that the dialogue was being trans-
mitted half way around the world, what would,
under other circumstances, be an unacceptably long
delay of about 15 seconds (for translation and
transmission) was generally quite tolerable,
because users could observe in the third window
that the correspondent was inputting something,
even if it could not read.

TRANSLATION QUALITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.910902125">
This environment was a good practical test of
our Machine Translation system, given that many
of the users had little or no knowledge of the tar-
get language: the effectiveness of the translation
could be judged by the extent to which communi-
cation was possible. Having said this, it should
also be remarked that the Japanese-English half of
the bilingual translation system is still in the
experimental stage and so translations in this
direction were not always of a quality comparable
to those in the other direction. To offset this, the
users at the Japanese end, who were mainly
researchers at our laboratory and therefore famil-
iar with some of the problems of Machine Transla-
tion, generally tried to avoid using difficult con-
structions, and tried to &apos;assist&apos; the system in some
other ways, notably by including subject and
object pronouns which might otherwise have been
omitted in more natural language.
We recognized that the translation of certain
phrases in the context of a dialogue might be dif-
ferent from their translation under normal circum-
stances. For example, English I see should be
translated as naruhodo rather than watashi ga
miru, Japanese wakarimashita should be I under-
stand rather than I have understood, and so on.
Nevertheless, the variety of such conversational
fillers is so wide that we inevitably could not
foresee them all.
The English-Japanese translation was of a high
quality, except of course where the users - being
inexperienced and often non-native speakers of
English - made typing mistakes, e.g. (1). (In
these and subsequent examples, E: indicates
English input, J: Japanese input, and T: transla-
tion. Translations into Japanese are not shown.
Typing errors and mistranslations are of course
reproduced from the original transmission.)
(1a) E: this morning i came frost. galle to
vizite the exosition.
E: it is vwery inyteresti ng to see so

(lb) E: I arderd &amp;quot;today&apos;s menu&amp;quot;.
(1c) E: i would go tolike a girl.
J: iptA 0 i-d-ko
T: I don&apos;t understand.
J: t o 1 ike Wig
T: What is tolike?
These were sometimes compounded by the
delay in screen echo of input characters, as in
example (2).
(2) E: Sometimes, I chanteh the topic,
suddenly.
E: I change teh topic.
J: 0 tto
T: I understand.

Failure to identify proper names or acronyms
often led to errors (by the system) or misunder-
standings (by the correspondent), as in (3a), espe-
cially when the form not to be translated happens
to be identical to a known word, as in (3b). In
(3b), &apos;go men na sae means in Japanese that I&apos;m
sorry.

One problem was that the system must always
give some output, even when it cannot analyse the
input correctly: in this environment failure to
give some result is simply unacceptable. Howev-
er, this is difficult when the input contains an
unknown word, especially when the source lan-
guage is Japanese and the unknown word is trans-
mitted as a kanji. Our example (6) nevertheless
shows how a cooperative user will make the most
of the output. Here, the non-translation of tsuki
mae (Alit) is compounded by its mis-translation
as a prepositional object. The first Japanese sen-
tence said that I married two months ago. But the
English correspondent imagines the untranslated
kanji might mean &apos;wives&apos;!

In the reverse direction, the problem is less
acute, since most Japanese users can at least read
Roman characters, even if they do not understand
them (7): this led in this case to an interesting
metadialogue. Again, the English user was cooper-
ative, and rephrased what he wanted to say in a
way that the system could translate correctly.

THE NATURE OF THE DIALOGUES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975863636363">
There has been some interesting research recent-
ly (at ATR in Osaka) into the nature of keyboard
dialogues (Arita et a/. 1987; Iida 1987) mainly
aimed at comparing telephone and keyboard conver-
sions. They have concluded that keyboard has the
same fundamental conversational features as tele-
phone conversation, notwithstanding the differ-
ences between written and spoken language. No
mention is made of what we are calling here meta-
dialogue, though it should be remembered that our
dialogues are quite different from those reported
by the ATR researchers in that we had a transla-
tion system as an intermediary. No comparable
experiment is known to us, so it is difficult to
find a yardstick against which to assess our find-
ings.
Regarding the subject matter of our dialogues,
this was of a very general nature, often about the
local situation (time, weather), the dialogue part-
ner (name, marital status, interests) or about
recent news. A lot of the dialogue actually con-
cerned the system itself, or the conversation. An

obvious example of this would be a request to
rephrase in the case of mistranslation, as we have
seen in (6) above, though not all users seemed to
understand the necessity of this tactic (8).

<bodyText confidence="0.999062833333333">
The most interesting metadialogues however
occurred when users failed to distinguish cited
words - a problem linguists are familiar with -
for example by quotation marks: these would then
be re-translated, sometimes leading to further
confusion (10).

E2: i thought it means number one.
J4: frilb;-0-t•thlo
T:What is the first?
E3: the translation to you was
incorrect.
This example may need explanation. First the
translation of the Japanese question (J1) has been
misunderstood: the translation should have been
&apos;Please give me your impressions of Japan&apos;, but the
English user (E-user) has understood Japanese to
mean &apos;Japanese language&apos;. That is, E-user has under-
stood J1 to be saying &apos;Please speak an impressive
Japanese word.&apos; Then E-user confused ichiban
(&apos;number l&apos; or &apos;the first&apos;) and ikebana (tower
arranging&apos;). The word ichibana (El) does not
exist in Japanese. His explanation &apos;number one&apos;
was correctly translated (not shown here) as
ichiban. But not realizing of course that the mean-
ing of his first sentence (J1) was incorrectly
understood, the Japanese user (J-user) could not
understand El (J2) and asked for its sense (J3).
So E-user tried to explain the meaning of
ichibana, which in fact was ichiban. By the
answer, J-user has identified what E-user ment,
but since J-user still did not realized that his first
sentence was incorrectly understood and hence J-
user has understood E2 to be saying that some-
thing was &apos;number l&apos;, he tried to ask what was
&apos;number l&apos; (J4).
But in the translation of this question, ichiban
(— ) was translated as &apos;the first&apos;. At this point,
it is not clear which comment E-user is referring
to in E3, but anyway, not realizing what answer
J-user have expected and not knowing enough
Japanese to realize what has happened - i.e. the
connection between &apos;number one&apos; and &apos;the first&apos; - E-
user gives up and changes the subject. If E-user
had intended to speak ikebana and explained its
meaning, J-user could have realized J1 had been
misunderstood. Because it is meaningless in a sen-
tence saying someone&apos;s impression that something
is ikebana.
On the other hand, where the user knew a lit-
tle of the foreign language (typically the Japanese
user knowing English rather than vice versa), such
a misunderstanding could be quickly dealt with
(11).
(11) E: How is the weathere in Tokyo?

CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999588">
There are a number of things to be learnt from
this experiment, even if it was not in fact set up
to elicit information of this kind. Clearly, typing
errors are a huge source of problems, so an envi-
ronment which minimizes these is highly desir-
able. Two obvious features of such an environment
are fast screen echo, and delete and back-space keys
which work in a predictable manner in relation to
what is seen on the screen. For the correction of
typing errors, the system should have a spelling-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.988063">
160
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993084">
check function which works word-by-word as
users are typing in. The main reasons for syntax
errors are ellipsis and unknown words. Therefore,
the system should have a rapid syntax-check func-
tion which can work before transmission or trans-
lation and can indicate to users that there is a syn-
tax error so that users can edit the input sentence
or reenter the correct sentence. These are in them-
selves not new ideas, of course (e.g. Kay 1980 and
others).
Conventions for citing forms not to be trans-
lated, especially in metadialogue, must be devel-
oped, and the Machine Translation system must be
sensitive to these. The system must be &apos;tuned&apos; in
other ways to make translations appropriate to
conversation, in particular in the translation of
conversational fillers like I see and wakarimashita.
Finally, it seems to be desirable that users be
trained briefly, not only to learn these conven-
tions, but also so that they understand the limits
of the system, and the kind of errors that get pro-
duced, especially since these are rather different
from the errors occasionally produced by human
translators or people conversing in a foreign lan-
guage that they know only partially.
