WordSmith Tools (Scott, 1998) offers a
program for comparing corpora, known as
KeyWords. KeyWords compares a word list
extracted from what has been called &apos;the
study corpus&apos; (the corpus which the
researcher is interested in describing) with a
word list made from a reference corpus. The
only requirement for a word list to be
accepted as reference corpus by the software
is that must be larger than the study corpus.
one of the most pressing questions with
respect to using KeyWords seems to be what
would be the ideal size of a reference
corpus. The aim of this paper is thus to
propose answers to this question. Five
English corpora were compared to reference
corpora of various sizes (varying from two
to 100 times larger than the study corpus).
The results indicate that a reference corpus
that is five times as large as the study corpus
yielded a larger number of keywords than a
smaller reference corpus. Corpora larger
than five times the size of the study corpus
yielded similar amounts of keywords. The
implication is that a larger reference corpus
is not always better than a smaller one, for
WordSmith Tools Keywords analysis, while
a reference corpus that is less than five times
the size of the study corpus may not be
reliable. There seems to be no need for using
extremely large reference corpora, given that
the number of keywords yielded do not
seem to change by using corpora larger than
five times the size of the study corpus.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945428268292683">
WordSmith Tools (Scott, 1998) offers a
program for comparing corpora, known as
KeyWords. This tool has been used in several
studies as a means for describing various lexico-
grammatical characteristics of different genres
(Barbara and Scott, 1999; Batista, 1998; Berber
Sardinha, 1995, 1999a, b; Berber Sardinha and
Shimazumi, 1998; Bonamin, 1999; Collins and
Scott, 1996; Conde, 1999; Dutra, 1999; Freitas,
1997; Fuzetti, 1999; Granger and Tribble, 1998;
Lima-Lopes, 1999; Lopes, 2000; Ramos, 1997;
Santos, 1999; Scott, 1997; Silva, 1999; Tribble,
1998). The keywords identified by the program
are not necessarily the &apos;most important words&apos; in
the corpus (Scott, 1997), or those that
correspond to readers&apos; intuitions as to what the
topics of the texts are. It is generally thought that
a set of WordSmith Tools keywords indicate
`aboutness&apos; (Phillips, 1989).
KeyWords compares a word list extracted
from what has been called &apos;the study corpus&apos;
(the corpus which the researcher is interested in
describing) with a word list made from a
reference corpus. The result is a list of
keywords, or words whose frequencies are
statistically higher in the study corpus than in
the reference corpus. The software also
identifies words whose frequencies are
statistically lower in the study corpus, which are
called &apos;negative keywords&apos;, in contrast to
positive keywords, which have higher
frequencies in the study corpus. Negative
keywords, though, will not be discussed in the
present paper. Hence, whenever keyword is
mentioned in this paper, it will mean &apos;positive
keyword&apos;.
The only requirement for a word list to be
accepted as reference corpus by the software is
that must be larger than the study corpus. Thus,
the composition and length of KeyWord lists can
vary according to at least six parameters:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.816636">
• The composition of the study corpus.
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.933122">
7
</page>
<listItem confidence="0.9635695">
• The composition of the reference
corpus.
• The size of the study corpus.
• The size of the reference corpus.
• The statistical test used in the
comparison of frequencies (log-
likelihood and chi-square are available).
• The level of significance (p) used as the
leyness&apos; benchmark (the cut-off point).
Since WordSmith Tools is Windows software,
it has appealed to a large audience of applied
linguists willing to do corpus-based research, to
whom this platform is generally the only one
that they know how to use. To them, one of the
most pressing questions with respect to using
KeyWords seems to be what would be the ideal
size of a reference corpus. The aim of this paper
is thus to propose answers to this question.

1 Using KeyWords
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9312379">
A KeyWord list is a portion of the study
corpus word list. KeyWords compares the
frequencies for each type in the study and
reference corpora. The program calculates the
log-likelihood (G2)&apos; or Chi-Square (X2) of each
word form based on its distribution in both
corpora, an example of which is given in the
table below.
Word Remaining Total
form x word forms
Study 10 90(90%) 100
corpus (10%) (100%)
Reference 10 (1%) 1000 (99%) 1010
corpus (100%)
For a distribution such as the above, both the
log-likelihood and chi-square statistics would
probably flag the word form in question as a
keyword, since its frequencies in the two
corpora are so different (10% versus 1%). The
way KeyWords processes word lists is not
unique, and has been applied by researchers
using other software (De Cock, Granger, Leech,
and McEnery, 1998; Granger and Rayson, 1998;
Milton, 1998).
After processing the word lists, the keyword
lists appear in WordSmith Tools as illustrated
below.

The reference corpora were compiled out of
texts published in &apos;The Guardian&apos;. The reason
for choosing it is that newspaper text is the most
typical kind of reference corpus used by applied
linguists, mainly because it is easy to get.
Therefore, the results obtained here would be
relevant to the typical user of KeyWords. The
reason for specifically choosing the Guardian is
that Mike Scott, the author of WordSmith Tools,
makes it available on his website a word list of
95 million tokens of The Guardian text on his
website. This has become a popular choice for
several WordSmith Tools users investigating
English keywords. Once again, it was hoped that
by using The Guardian, the investigation would
mirror a typical choice of WordSmith users. For
the present study, a portion of the Guardian
word list was used, namely from texts published
in 1994, taken randomly.
The size of the reference corpora varied
according to the size of the study corpora. For
each study corpus, 18 reference corpora were
created. Each one was n times larger than the
study corpus, with n being 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100. For
instance, the letters corpus had 11,761 tokens,
and so for n=2 the size of the reference corpus
was 23,552 tokens (11,761 * 2); for n=3, the
reference corpus size was 35,283 (11,761 x 3),
for n=4 47,044, and so on, up to n=100, whose
size was 1,176,100 words.
The KeyWords settings used for the
comparisons were as follows:

The results indicate that the number of keywords
increases as the size of the reference corpus
increases, but this increase is not linear. For
instance, the keywords for n=2 in the letters
corpus was 279, for n=3 it was 347, and for n=
100 the total keywords was 475. Had the growth
been linear, for n=3 there would be 418
keywords, and for n=100 13,950. Obviously, a
total of 13,950 keywords could never have been
obtained since the maximum possible number of

<bodyText confidence="0.99977225">
keywords in the letters corpus is 2,415, which is
the total number of types. The same is true of all
the other corpora.
This suggests that there must be a point at
which the growth in number of keywords
diminishes. This can be shown by plotting the
number of keywords for each size of n across all
the study corpora, as in the graph below.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.833454">
Plot 1: Distribution of keywords
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983">
The plot shows that for all study corpora the
keyword totals rose from n=2 to n=3, then fell or
stabilized at n=4, rose again at n=5 and from
then on basically reached a plateau. For instance,
for the letters corpus, the keyword totals for n=2,
n=3, n=4, n=5, and n=6 were respectively 11.6,
14.4, 14.7, 19.9, and 19.9. Hence, there was
indeed a considerable rise from n=2 to n=3 (11.6
to 14.4), followed by a slight rise at n=4 (14.7),
then a major increase at n=5 (19.9), and there
was no change from n=5 to n=6 (19.9 to 19.9).
In order to check where the major changes
occurred, an ANOVA was run on the keyword
totals across the various n sizes. The results are
shown in the table below.

The REGWF test presents the results in terms
of groupings, identified by letters. Keyword
totals in the same grouping are not statistically
different. Hence, sizes of n equal to 40, 60, 20,
100, 80, 90, 30, 70, 50, 5, and 6 formed
grouping A, which has on average 14.066% to
14.884% keyword totals. Likewise, n sizes equal
to 70, 50, 5, 6, and 8 were in grouping B, with
averages ranging from 13.686% to 14.694%.
Note that this is overlap among groupings, and
so groupings A, B, C and D are in fact joined.
This grouping comprises n sizes ranging from 5

3 and 4, and grouping F by n=2.

The results suggest, then, that the critical value
for a reference corpus seems to be .five. In other
words, the answer to the question &apos;what is the
ideal size of a reference corpus&apos; is five. A
reference corpus that is five times as large as the
study corpus yields a larger number of keywords
than a smaller reference corpus. This means that
the results of a keyword analysis based on a
reference corpus that is less than five times the
size of the study corpus could be very different
from a study done on a corpus, say, just three
times larger than the study corpus, in so far as
the number of keywords go. Several potentially
revealing keywords could be left out of the
analysis if the reference corpus is not as large as
five times or more.

<bodyText confidence="0.999311839285714">
The aim of this study was to estimate the ideal
size of a reference corpus to be used in
WordSmith Tools Key Words procedure.
KeyWords provides facilities for comparing a
study corpus to a reference corpus, which, by
default, must be larger than study corpus.
The results indicated that a reference corpus
that is five times larger than the study corpus
yields a similar amount of keywords than
reference corpora that are up to 100 times larger
than the study corpus. This was taken to mean
that a reference corpus does not need to be more
than five times larger than the study corpus.
In sum, a larger reference corpus is not always
better than a smaller one, for WordSmith Tools
Keywords analysis. There seems to be no need
for using extremely large reference corpora,
given that the number of keywords yielded do
not seem to change by using corpora larger than
five times the size of the study corpus. This may
be important for WordSmith Tools users, who
may be short of disk space and memory on their
PCs to process large reference corpora. A
suggestion that might come out of this finding is
that researchers should not spend time and
resources building, collecting or searching for
larger and larger reference corpora. Resources
would be better spent in the compilation of
reference corpora that are more suitable in terms
of their contents viz a viz the study corpus.
This study did not tackle several important
questions. One of them is whether the keywords
that were identified represent the main concepts
or topics found the texts. A qualitative study
would be needed to answer this, as an
independent test of validity of the status of the
keywords. Another question is the effect of the
size of the study corpus. It is not known how
study corpora of the same size behave in terms
of the total keywords that they yield when
compared to reference corpora of the same size.
Another question is the composition of the
keyword lists obtained. This study restricted
itself to quantitative aspects of keyword list
variation, but it would be important that changes
be assessed qualitatively as well. In particular, it
would be pertinent to know which keywords
were added or dropped as the levels of n
change&amp; . Finally, the fact that Brown corpus
texts are short fragments and not whole texts
may have upset the results, since the number of
keywords seems to vary considerably as a
function of the size of the texts (Mike Scott,
personal communication). Shorter texts provide
less room for repetition, which in turn influences
word frequencies.

<abstract confidence="0.999707971428572">WordSmith Tools (Scott, 1998) offers a program for comparing corpora, known as KeyWords. KeyWords compares a word list extracted from what has been called &apos;the study corpus&apos; (the corpus which the researcher is interested in describing) with a word list made from a reference corpus. The only requirement for a word list to be accepted as reference corpus by the software is that must be larger than the study corpus. one of the most pressing questions with respect to using KeyWords seems to be what would be the ideal size of a reference corpus. The aim of this paper is thus to propose answers to this question. Five English corpora were compared to reference corpora of various sizes (varying from two to 100 times larger than the study corpus). The results indicate that a reference corpus that is five times as large as the study corpus yielded a larger number of keywords than a smaller reference corpus. Corpora larger than five times the size of the study corpus yielded similar amounts of keywords. The implication is that a larger reference corpus is not always better than a smaller one, for WordSmith Tools Keywords analysis, while a reference corpus that is less than five times the size of the study corpus may not be reliable. There seems to be no need for using extremely large reference corpora, given that the number of keywords yielded do not seem to change by using corpora larger than five times the size of the study corpus.</abstract>

Introduction WordSmith Tools (Scott, 1998) offers a program for comparing corpora, known as KeyWords. This tool has been used in several studies as a means for describing various lexicogrammatical characteristics of different genres (Barbara and Scott, 1999; Batista, 1998; Berber Sardinha, 1995, 1999a, b; Berber Sardinha and Shimazumi, 1998; Bonamin, 1999; Collins and Scott, 1996; Conde, 1999; Dutra, 1999; Freitas, 1997; Fuzetti, 1999; Granger and Tribble, 1998; Lima-Lopes, 1999; Lopes, 2000; Ramos, 1997; Santos, 1999; Scott, 1997; Silva, 1999; Tribble, 1998). The keywords identified by the program are not necessarily the &apos;most important words&apos; in the corpus (Scott, 1997), or those that correspond to readers&apos; intuitions as to what the topics of the texts are. It is generally thought that a set of WordSmith Tools keywords indicate `aboutness&apos; (Phillips, 1989). KeyWords compares a word list extracted from what has been called &apos;the study corpus&apos; (the corpus which the researcher is interested in describing) with a word list made from a reference corpus.</context>
