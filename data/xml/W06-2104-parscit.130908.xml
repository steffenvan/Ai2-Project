This paper discusses the partitive-genitive
case alternation of Finnish adpositions. This
case alternation is explained in terms of
bidirectional alignment of markedness in
form and meaning. Marked PP meanings are
assigned partitive case, unmarked ones
genitive case.

This paper explores the relation of spatial
adpositions and case in Finnish. Two major
classes of adpositions in Finnish can be
distinguished, one combining with genitive case,
the other with partitive case. A third, very small
set can combine with both. The meaning of these
latter adpositions depends on whether they are
combined with partitive case or genitive case, as
illustrated in the following examples:

In Section 2 and 3, I will show what determines
the markedness of adpositional phrases (PPs). In
Section 4, I will give a short introduction of
bidirectional OT, with which I will analyze the
Finnish data in Section 5. Before ending with
conclusions, I will shortly discuss the role of
word order (i.e., pre- vs. postpositional use of the
adposition).

Markedness of Meaning

<bodyText confidence="0.999801821428572">
There are different ways to diagnose
markedness. De Hoop et al. (2003) mention
amongst others order of acquisition (the
unmarked form is acquired before the marked
one), context (the unmarked interpretation of a
form is the interpretation it gets in neutral
context), syntactic/morphological complexity (a
simple form or construction is less marked than a
complex form or construction), and frequency
(the unmarked option occurs more often than the
marked one). In what follows I will use these
criteria on properties of adpositions.
Spatial meaning is usually divided into
locational and directional meaning. The former
could be said to be less complex than the second,
since directional meaning by definition implies a
change in place (cf. Helmantel 1998; Jackendoff
1983). This difference in complexity is also
reflected in the order of acquisition of spatial
prepositions, as locatives are acquired before
directionals (Bowerman and Choi 2001). I
propose that some directional meaning can be
even more complex. Compare the following
schematizations of locative meaning (3a), simple
directional meaning (3b/c), and complex
directional meaning (3d). The squares represent
the Ground, each round the Figure at a different
moment in time:2

Following Zwarts (1997, 2003a, 2003b), we can
describe the relation between a Figure and a
Ground by means of vectors. The simple
directional meaning puts restrictions on either the
direction (in case of a straight line (3b)) or the
length (in case of a circle (3c)) of the vectors.
Complex directional meaning imposes no
restrictions whatsoever (3d). That the distinction
between (3c) and (3d) is linguistically relevant
can be seen in the following Ancient Greek
example. In (4a), dia combined with the genitive
case indicates a simple, straight line, whereas the
combination with accusative case in (4b) refers
to a complex directional meaning, in which the
Ground is almost completely covered by the
path:

I argue that this difference in spatial complexity
corresponds to a difference in semantic
markedness, (4a) being less marked than (4b).
An adposition can be non-concrete, or
non-spatial. Solstad (2002) discusses the
opposition spatial - non-spatial. Comparing
spatial and causal meaning of the German
preposition durch, he shows that in an unmarked
syntactic position, that is, attached at the VP or
IP level, the spatial meaning of a durch PP wins.
In a marked position, that is, attached as CP
adjunct, the causal meaning wins. Following the
syntactic complexity criterion, the spatial
meaning is unmarked, and the causal reading is
marked.
It is by definition impossible to locate an
abstract notion in space. As adpositions prefer a
spatial meaning, an abstract PP object is more
marked than a concrete one. This markedness is
reflected in the complexity of the form:
Prepositions that typically take abstract objects
are often morphologically more complex.
m
Examples are the following Dutch prepositions,
and their English equivalents: vanwege ‘because
of’, betreffende ‘concerning’, met betrekking tot
‘with regard to’, and aangaande ‘concerning’.
Concluding this section, we can say that
a PP preferably has a simple, concrete, spatial
meaning.

of Form
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999831">
As we want to pair meaning with form, let us
look at the markedness of the form of Finnish
adpositional phrases. In Finnish in general, there
are more postpositions than prepositions.
Postpositions combine more often with genitive
case than with partitive (54 vs. 10, respectively).
The prepositions have a small preference for
partitive case (9 vs. 6). Also for spatial
adpositions, genitive case is assigned most, as
can be seen in (5) and (6):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99175">
(5) Spatial adpositions assigning genitive case: al
‘under’, ede-/ete- ‘front’ jälke-/jälje-
‘after’ luo- ‘to’, ‘by’, pää- ‘on’, sisä ‘in’, ta(ka)-
‘back’, viere- ‘beside’.
(6) Spatial adpositions assigning partitive case:
koh- ‘towards’, pitkin ‘along’, ‘all over’, päin
‘against’, vast- ‘against’, ‘in the opposite
direction’.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.871570636363636">
Assuming that the most frequent form is
unmarked (cf. the frequency criterion), we can
conclude that genitive case is the unmarked form
for the complement of the PP in Finnish.3
Before analyzing the Finnish data in
Section 5, I will first introduce Bidirectional OT,
the framework I am using.
3 Another motivation for genitive being the standard case,
though not pursued here, is the origin of adpositions.
Postpositions deriving from nouns, like pää &lt; ‘head’,
usually take genitive case.

<bodyText confidence="0.988811625">
Optimality Theory is a model of the system of
the linguistic knowledge a speaker of a language
has (cf. Prince and Smolensky 1993). The rules
in this grammar are violable constraints, which
can be in conflict with each other. Weak
constraints can be violated in order to satisfy
stronger ones. Each language has its own specific
hierarchy of constraints. In the Generator
possible output candidates (forms in case of
production, and meanings in case of perception)
are formed, that are evaluated in the Evaluator.
The candidate that has the least serious violations
of the constraints is the winner.
Bidirectional OT gives a general
procedure of optimization of the relation of form
and meaning, simultaneously optimizing in both
directions, from meaning to form, and from form
to meaning. Hence, BiOT evaluates form-
meaning pairs (Blutner et al. to appear: 90-91).
In bidirectional OT a form-meaning pair is called
super-optimal if there is no other super-optimal
form-meaning pair with a different (i.e. less
marked) form that expresses the same meaning
better, and there is no other super-optimal form-
meaning pair with a different meaning that is a
better interpretation of that same form. This
yields two super-optimal form-meaning pairs,
namely the unmarked form with the unmarked
meaning, and the marked form with the marked
meaning. The widely attested Markedness
principle of Horn (1984) which states that
marked forms in languages go with marked
meanings (and unmarked forms with unmarked
meanings) is thus accounted for by bidirectional
OT.
In section 2 we saw which properties of a PP are
marked. An unmarked PP preferably expresses a
simple, concrete, spatial meaning. Put into
markedness constraints, we get:
*COMPLEXITY: avoid semantic complexity
BC (BE CONCRETE): have a concrete meaning
In my analysis, simple directional meaning
violates *Complexity once, whereas complex
directional meaning yields a double violation. In
section 3, genitive case was shown to be the most
frequent, hence unmarked form. We can put this
finding in a markedness constraint on the form of
the PP:

5 Analysis of the Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998793">
Now let us have a look at the Finnish data. The
general distribution of spatial adpositions was
given in (5) and (6) above. This general
distribution seems to follow the opposition
locative-directional: as ‘towards’, ‘along’,
‘against’ are directional and the others (roughly)
locational.4
As illustrated in Tableau 1, directional meanings
violate *Complexity, and partitive forms violate
UG.5
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.950258">

&lt;part, dir &gt; * *
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999766">
Since the form-meaning pair &lt;gen, loc&gt; is the
only candidate that satisfies all constraints it is
the first super-optimal pair. In a second round of
optimization the pairs &lt;gen, dir&gt; and &lt;part, loc&gt;
fall out, because there is another form-meaning
pair, namely &lt;gen, loc&gt;, with either a less
marked meaning that is expressed by the same
form, or with a less marked form that expresses
the same meaning. This yields the second super-
optimal form-meaning pair, namely &lt;part, dir&gt;
which combines the marked form with the
marked meaning.
The unmarked locational meaning
corresponds to the unmarked genitive form, and
the marked directional one to the marked
partitive. Thus, the general distribution of
Finnish adpositions is accounted for.
But, as mentioned before, besides these
two groups, Finnish has a third set of adpositions
combining with both cases:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.839353166666667">
4 The following test can be used to discriminate locatives
from directional adpositions: the former can be combined
with the verb to be, the latter with verbs of motion, such as
to go.

case: ympdri- ‘around’, keske-‘middle’, ldhe-

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999307625">
The meaning of such adpositions in combination
with genitive case is different from that of a
combination with partitive case. In what follows,
I will give an account of the form-meaning pairs
involving these adpositions. First, let us look at
the alternation of ympdri ‘around’ shown in
examples (1) and (2), repeated below for
convenience.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.985296166666667">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996871571428572">
In (1) around indicates a complex, random path
comparable to the Greek example (4b),
schematized in (3d). In (2) however, around
describes a circle with the city as its centre (cf.
(3c)). The constraint on complexity is playing a
role in this alternation, as is illustrated in Tableau
2:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.928296888888889">

<bodyText confidence="0.999982583333333">
As expected, the genitive case has the unmarked
simple meaning, whereas the partitive case
combines with the complex one. Simple
directional meaning violates *Complexity once,
as it is one step more complex than locational
meaning; complex directional meaning yields a
double violation.
The alternation of keskelld ‘in the
middle’ can be explained along the same lines.
Again, genitive case combines with the
unmarked meaning in (9), whereas the partitive
is assigned the marked notion ‘all over’ in (8):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.873679777777778">
(8) lelu-t o-vat

floor-GEN in.the.middle.of
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.975721125">
‘The toys are in the middle of the floor’
(lit. at the centre)
The third adposition to deal with is ldhelld
‘near’. For the previous adpositions we saw that
the case alternation was only used for an
extended meaning. Rather unexpectedly, for
ldhelld partitive case is also possible within the
simple spatial domain, as shown in (10).6
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6470294">
(10) auto on talo-n

ldhelld ( / talo-a)

‘The car is near the house’
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992110666666667">
As soon as the concreteness constraint BC
becomes of importance, however, partitive case
is used, as is clear from (11):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.758025">
(11) ole-mme ldhelld ratkaisu-a

‘We are close to a solution’
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999798833333333">
In this example, the constraint BC comes into
play. The abstract meaning combines with
partitive case, whereas the concrete one can have
both cases. This is shown in the following
tableau, in which the unpredicted pair is
indicated with a question mark:

<footnote confidence="0.904122666666667">
6 Indeed, it is not always the case that there is a clear one-to-

discussion on optionality I refer to De Hoop et al. (2003).

<bodyText confidence="0.99986">
Finally, let us turn to yli ‘over’. The
preposition over has extensively been studied for
English (cf. Lakoff 1987; Brugman 1988; Dewell
1994). The more central meanings are the
locative ‘be in the space above something’ and
‘be on the other side of something’, and the
directional ‘starting from one side of something,
go to the other side via the covering space’ and
‘starting from one side of something, go to the
other side via its (top) surface’. The reading ‘to
exceed something’ that ‘over’ also has, is further
removed from the central meaning. In Finnish we
see that the more central notions are covered by
the genitive case, as is shown in (12) and (13):
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.5717174">

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.979528">
Only within the extended ‘Excess’ meaning, the
partitive case can occur, as can be seen in (14):

‘The price of this car is higher than
2500 Euro’
It is still possible to use genitive case here, but
the 2500 Euro is pragmatically different for both
constructions. With partitive case, it is an
arbitrary amount, whereas it is precisely the
amount I intended to spend on the car with the
genitive. Here, the prominence of the amount
makes it more concrete.

<bodyText confidence="0.99981675">
As noted above, there is a correlation between
the syntactic position and case in the Finnish
adpositional system. How do we know that it is
not the syntactic position that determines the
markedness, instead of case (cf. (1) and (2))?
First, the correlation should not be taken as a
strict rule, as both postpositional and
prepositional lähellä can govern partitive case:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.639270222222222">
(15) auto on talo-a
car.NOM be.SG.PRES house-PART
lähellä (/ talo-a)
near house-PART
‘The car is near the house’
Other examples of the indifference of the
partitive with respect to its position are kohti and
ennen:
(16) auto tul-i
car.NOM come-3SG.PAST
minu-a kohti (/ minu-a)
1SG-PART towards 1SG-PART
‘The car was coming towards me’
(17) hän saapu-i
s/he.NOM arrive-3SG.PAST
minu-a ennen (/ minu-a)
1SG-PART before 1SG-PART
‘S/he arrived before me’
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.997874">
A more complex example is given in (18) and
(19). Sometimes, the non-standard combination
of partitive with a postposition yields a
metaphorical reading, whereas the standard
combination with a preposition yields a concrete
reading:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.723252571428571">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.6951805">
lähellä minu-a

‘This is close to me’
Hence, markedness is not just a matter of the
overall less frequent use of a preposition –
otherwise (19) should have the metaphorical

reading. Apparently, there is an additional
constraint on the form which does not say “use
postpositions rather than prepositions”, but “use
postpositions for genitive case and prepositions
for partitive”.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999514454545454">
In this paper I used a bidirectional OT approach
to account for the case distribution in the Finnish
spatial adpositional system. I argued that
adpositions in general can have a more or less
marked meaning. In Finnish this markedness is
reflected in the assignment of case. Partitive
case, as the marked form, is assigned to marked
adpositions, and the unmarked genitive case is
used for the unmarked ones. Within case
alternating adpositions, this same tendency is
found, albeit along different lines of markedness.

This case alternation is explained in terms of bidirectional alignment of markedness in form and meaning. Marked PP meanings are assigned partitive case, unmarked ones genitive case. This paper explores the relation of spatial adpositions and case in Finnish. Two major classes of adpositions in Finnish can be distinguished, one combining with genitive case, the other with partitive case. A third, very small set can combine with both. The meaning of these latter adpositions depends on whether they are combined with partitive case or genitive case, as illustrated in the following examples: (1) juoks-i-mme ympäri ‘We were running around in the city’ (2) juoks-i-mme kaupungi-n ‘We ran around the city’ In Section 2 and 3, I will show what determines the markedness of adpositional phrases (PPs).

The former could be said to be less complex than the second, since directional meaning by definition implies a change in place (cf. Helmantel 1998; Jackendoff 1983). This difference in complexity is also reflected in the order of acquisition of spatial prepositions, as locatives are acquired before directionals (Bowerman and Choi 2001).

Postpositions deriving from nouns, like pää &lt; ‘head’, usually take genitive case. 24 4 Bidirectional OT GEN: use genitive case on the object of an adposition. Optimality Theory is a model of the system of the linguistic knowledge a speaker of a language has (cf. Prince and Smolensky 1993). The rules in this grammar are violable constraints, which can be in conflict with each other. Weak constraints can be violated in order to satisfy stronger ones. Each language has its own specific hierarchy of constraints. In the Generator possible output candidates (forms in case of production, and meanings in case of perception) are formed, that are evaluated in the Evaluator. The candidate that has the least serious violations of the constraints is the winner. Bidirectional OT gives a general procedure of optimization of the relation of form and meaning, simultaneously optimizing in both </context>

An adposition can be non-concrete, or non-spatial. Solstad (2002) discusses the opposition spatial - non-spatial. Comparing spatial and causal meaning of the German preposition durch, he shows that in an unmarked syntactic position, that is, attached at the VP or IP level, the spatial meaning of a durch PP wins. In a marked position, that is, attached as CP adjunct, the causal meaning wins. Following the syntactic complexity criterion, the spatial meaning is unmarked, and the causal reading is marked. It is by definition impossible to locate an abstract notion in space. As adpositions prefer a spatial meaning, an abstract PP object is more marked than a con</context>
