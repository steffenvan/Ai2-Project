This paper presents a feasibility study for im-
plementing lexical morphology principles in a
machine translation system in order to solve
unknown words. Multilingual symbolic treat-
ment of word-formation is seducing but re-
quires an in-depth analysis of every step that
has to be performed. The construction of a
prototype is firstly presented, highlighting the
methodological issues of such approach. Sec-
ondly, an evaluation is performed on a large
set of data, showing the benefits and the limits

<bodyText confidence="0.999962896551724">
Formalising morphological information to deal
with morphologically constructed unknown
words in machine translation seems attractive,
but raises many questions about the resources
and the prerequisites (both theoretical and practi-
cal) that would make such symbolic treatment
efficient and feasible. In this paper, we describe
the prototype we built to evaluate the feasibility
of such approach. We focus on the knowledge
required to build such system and on its evalua-
tion. First, we delimit the issue of neologisms
amongst the other unknown words (section 2),
and we present the few related work done in
NLP research (section 3). We then explain why
implementing morphology in the context of ma-
chine translation (MT) is a real challenge and
what kind of aspects need to be taken into ac-
count (section 4), and we show that translating
constructed neologisms is not only a mechanical
decomposition but requires more fine-grained
analysis. We then describe the methodology de-
veloped to build up a prototyped translator of
constructed neologisms (section 5) with all the
extensions that have to be made, especially in
terms of resources. Finally, we concentrate on
the evaluation of each step of the process and on
the global evaluation of the entire approach (sec-
tion 6). This last evaluation highlights a set of
methodological criteria that are needed to exploit
lexical morphology in machine translation.
Unknown words are a problematic issue in any
NLP tool. Depending on the studies (Ren and
Perrault 1992; Maurel 2004), it is estimated that
between 5 and 10 % of the words of a text writ-
ten in “standard” language are unknown to lexi-
cal resources. In a MT context (analysis-transfer-
generation), unknown words remain not only
unanalysed but they cannot be translated, and
sometimes they also stop the translation of the
whole sentence.
Usually, three main groups of unknown words
are distinguished: proper names, errors, and ne-
ologisms, and the possible solution highly de-
pends on the type of unknown word to be solved.
In this paper, we concentrate on neologisms
which are constructed following a morphological
process.
The processing of unknown “constructed ne-
ologisms” in NLP can be done by simple guess-
ing (based on the sequence of final letters). This
option can be efficient enough when the task is
only tagging, but in a multilingual context (like
in MT), dealing with constructed neologisms
implies a transfer and a generation process that
require a more complex formalisation and im-
plementation. In the project presented in this pa-
per, we propose to implement lexical morphol-
ogy phenomena in MT.

Implementing lexical morphology in a MT con-
text has seldom been investigated in the past,
probably because many researchers share the
following view: “Though the idea of providing
rules for translating derived words may seem
attractive, it raises many problems and so it is
currently more of a research goal for MT than a
practical possibility” (Arnold, Balkan et al.
1994). As far as we know, the only related pro-
ject is described in (Gdaniec, Manandise et al.
2001), where they describe a project of imple-
mentation of rules for dealing with constructed
words in the IBM MT system.

Even in monolingual contexts, lexical mor-
phology is not very often implemented in NLP.
Morphological analyzers like the ones described
in (Porter 1980; Byrd 1983; Byrd, Klavans et al.
1989; Namer 2005) propose more or less deeper
lexical analyses, to exploit that dimension of the
lexicon.

4 Proposed solution
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896282051282">
Since morphological processes are regular and
exist in many languages, we propose an approach
where constructed neologisms in source lan-
guage (SL) can be analysed and their translation
generated in a target language (TL) through the
transfer of the constructional information.
For example, a constructed neologism in one
language (e.g. ricostruire in Italian) should
firstly be analysed, i.e. find (i) the rule that pro-
duced it (in this case &lt;reiteration rule&gt;) and (ii)
the lexeme-base which it is constructed on
(costruire, with all morphosyntactic and transla-
tional information). Secondly, through a transfer
mechanism (of both the rule and the base), a
translation can be generated by rebuilding a con-
structed word, (in French reconstruire, Eng: to
rebuild). On a theoretical side, the whole process
is formalised into bilingual Lexeme Formation
Rules (LFR), as explained below in section 4.3.
Although this approach seems to be simple
and attractive, feasibility studies and evaluation
should be carefully performed. To do so, we built
a system to translate neologisms from one lan-
guage into another. In order to delimit the project
and to concentrate on methodological issues, we
focused on the prefixation process and on two
related languages (Italian and French). Prefixa-
tion is, after suffixation, the most productive
process of neologism, and prefixes can be more
easily processed in terms of character strings.
Regarding the language, we choose to deal with
the translation of Italian constructed neologisms
into French. These two languages are historically
and morphologically related and are conse-
quently more “neighbours” in terms of neolo-
gism coinage.
In the following, we firstly describe precisely
the phenomena that have to be formalized and
then the prototype built up for the experiment.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996923">
4.1 Phenomena to be formalized
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987254237288">
Like in any MT project, the formalisation work
has to face different issues of contrastivity, i.e.
highlighting the divergences and the similarities
between the two languages.
In the two languages chosen for the experi-
ment, few divergences were found in the way
they construct prefixed neologisms. However, in
some cases, although the morphosemantic proc-
ess is similar, the item used to build it up (i.e. the
affixes) is not always the same. For example, to
coin nouns of the spatial location “before”,
where Italian uses the prefix retro, French uses
rétro and arrière. A deeper analysis shows that
Italian retro is used with all types of nouns,
whereas in French, rétro only forms processual
nouns (derived from verbs, like rétrovision,
rétroprojection). For the other type of nouns
(generally locative nouns), arrière is used (ar-
rière-cabine, arrière-cour).
Other problematic issues appear when there is
more than one prefix for the same LFR. For ex-
ample, the rule for “indeterminate plurality” pro-
vides in both languages a set of two prefixes
(multi/pluri in Italian and multi/pluri in French)
with no known restrictions for selecting one or
the other (e.g. both pluridimensionnel and multi-
dimensionnel are acceptable in French). For
these cases, further empirical research have to be
performed to identify restrictions on the rule.
Another important divergence is found in the
prefixation of relational adjectives. Relational
adjectives are derived from nouns and designate
a relation between the entity denoted by the noun
they are derived from and the entity denoted by
the noun they modify. Consequently, in a pre-
fixation such as anticostituzionale, the formal
base is a relational adjective (costituzionale), but
the semantic base is the noun the adjective is de-
rived from (costituzione). The constructed word
anticostituzionale can be paraphrased as “against
the constitution”. Moreover, when the relational
adjective does not exist, prefixation is possible
on a nominal base to create an adjective (squadra
antidroga). In cases where the adjective does
exist, both forms are possible and seem to be
equally used, like in the Italian collaborazione
interuniversità / collaborazione interuniversi-
taria. From a contrastive point of view, the pre-
fixation of relational adjectives exists in both
languages (Italian and French) and in both these
languages prefixing a noun to create an adjective
is also possible (anticostituzione (Adj)). But we
notice an important discrepancy in the possibility
of constructing relational adjectives (a rough es-
timation performed on a large bilingual diction-
ary (Garzanti IT-FR (2006)) shows that more
than 1 000 Italian relational adjectives have no
equivalent in French (and are generally translated
with a prepositional phrase).

All these divergences require an in-dept analy-
sis but can be overcome only if the formalism
and the implementation process are done follow-

4.2 The prototype
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998888384615385">
In order to evaluate the approach described
above and to concretely investigate the ins and
outs of such implementation, we built up a proto-
type of a machine translation system specialized
for constructed neologisms. This prototype is
composed of two modules. The first one checks
every unknown word to see if it is potentially
constructed, and if so, performs a morphological
analysis to individualise the lexeme-base and the
rule that coined it. The second module is the ac-
tual translation module, which analyses the con-
structed neologism and generates a possible
translation.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.997825">
Figure 1: Prototype
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996266666667">
The whole prototype relies on one hand on
lexical resources (two monolingual and one bi-
lingual) and on a set of bilingual Lexeme Forma-
tion Rules (LFR). These two sets of information
helps the analysis and the generation steps. When
a neologism is looked-up, the system checks if it
is constructed with one of the LFRs and if the
lexeme-base is in the lexicon. If it is the case, the
transfer brings the relevant morphological and
lexical information in the target language. The
generation step constructs the translation equiva-
lent, using the information provided by the LFR
and the lexical resources. Consequently, the
whole system relies on the quality of both the
lexical resources and the LFR.

4.3 Bilingual Lexeme Formation Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999621866666667">
The whole morphological process in the system
is formalised through bilingual Lexeme Forma-
tion Rules. Their representation is inspired by
(Fradin 2003) as shown in figure 2 in the rule of
reiterativity.
Such rules match together two monolingual
rules (to be read in columns). Each monolingual
rule describes a process that applies a series of
instructions on the different sections of the lex-
eme : the surface section (G and F), the syntactic
category (SX) and the semantic (S) sections. In
this theoretical framework, affixation is only one
of the instructions of the rule (the graphemic and
phonological modification), and consequently,
affixes are called “exponent” of the rule.

This formalisation is particularly useful in a
bilingual context for rules that have more than
one prefix in both languages: more than one affix
can be declared in one single rule, the selection
being made according to different constraints or
restrictions. For example, the rule for “indeter-
minate plurality” explained in section 4.1 can be
formalised as follows:

In this kind of rules with “multiple expo-

theoretical level.
Such rules have been formalised and imple-
mented for the 56 productive prefixes of Italian
(Iacobini 2004)1, with their French translation
equivalent. However, finding the translation
equivalent for each rule requires specific studies

of the morphological system of both languages in

The following section briefly summarises the

acquire this type of contrastive knowledge.

4.4 Knowledge acquisition of bilingual LFR
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996617948718">
As in any MT system, the acquisition of bilin-
gual knowledge is an important issue. In mor-
phology, the method should be particularly accu-
rate to prevent any methodological bias. To for-
malise translation rules for prefixed neologisms,
we adopt a meaning-to-form approach, i.e. dis-
covering how a constructed meaning is morpho-
logically realised in two languages.
We build up a tertium comparationis (a neu-
tral platform, see (James 1980) for details) that
constitute a semantic typology of prefixation
processes. This typology aims to be universal
and therefore applicable to all the languages con-
cerned. On a practical point of view, the typol-
ogy has been built up by summing up various
descriptions of prefixation in various languages
(Montermini 2002; Iacobini 2004; Amiot 2005).
We end up with six main classes: location,
evaluation, quantitative, modality, negation and
ingressive. The classes are then subdivided ac-
cording to sub-meanings: for example, location
is subdivided in temporal and spatial, and within
spatial location, a distinction is made between
different positions (before, above, below, in
front, ...).
Prefixes of both languages are then literally
“projected” (or classified) onto the tertium. For
each terminal sub-class, we have a clear picture
of the prefixes involved in both languages. For
example, the LFR presented in figure 1 is the
result of the projection of the Italian prefix (ri)
and the French one (re) on the sub-class reitera-
tivity, which is a sub-class of modality.
At the end of the comparison, we end up with
more than 100 LFRs (one rule can be reiterated
according the different input and output catego-
ries). From a computing point of view, con-
straints have to be specified and the lexicon has
to be adapted consequently.

5 Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897142857143">
Implementation of the LFR is set up as a data-
base, from where the program takes the informa-
tion to perform the analysis, the transfer and the
generation of the neologisms. In our approach,
LFRs are simply declared in a tab format data-
base, easily accessible and modifiable by the
user, as shown below:
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999018">
Figure 4: Implemented LFRs
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968363636364">
Implemented LFRs describe (i) the surface
form of the Italian prefix to be analysed, (ii) the
category of the base, (iii) the category of the de-
rived lexeme (the output), (iv) a reference to the
rule implied and (v) the French prefix(es) for the
generation.
The surface form in (i) should sometimes take
into account the different allomorphs of one pre-
fix. Consequently, the rule has to be reiterated in
order to be able to recognize any forms (e.g. the
prefix in has different forms according to the ini-
tial letter of the base, and four rules have to be
implemented for the four allomorphs (in, il, im,
ir)). In some other cases, the initial consonant is
doubled, and the algorithm has to take this phe-
nomenon into account.
In (ii), the information of the category of the
base has been “overspecified”, to differentiate
qualitative and relational adjectives, and deverbal
nouns and the other ones (a_rel/a or
n_dev/n). These overspecifications have two
objectives: optimizing the analysis performance
(reducing the noise of homographic character
strings that look like constructed neologisms but
that are only misspellings - see below in the
evaluation section), and refining the analysis, i.e.
selecting the appropriate LFR and, consequently,
the appropriate translation.
To identify relational adjectives and deverbal
nouns, the monolingual lexicon that supports the
analysis step has to be extended. Thereafter, we
present the symbolic method we used to perform
such extension.

5.1 Extension of the monolingual lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999066142857143">
Our MT prototype relies on lexical resources: it
aims at dealing with unknown words that are not
in a Reference lexicon and these unknown words
are analyzed with lexical material that is in this
lexicon.
From a practical point of view, our prototype
is based on two very large monolingual data-

bases (Mmorph (Bouillon, Lehmann et al. 1998))
for Italian and French, that contain only morpho-
syntactic information, and on one bilingual lexi-
con that has been built semi-automatically for the
use of the experiment. But the monolingual
lexica have to be adapted to provide specific in-
formation necessary for dealing with morpho-
logical process.
As stated above, identifying the prefix and the
base is not enough to provide a proper analysis
of constructed neologisms which is detailed
enough to be translated. The main information
that is essential for the achievement of the proc-
ess is the category of the base, which has to be
sometimes “overspecified”. Obviously, the Ital-
ian reference lexicon does not contain such in-
formation. Consequently, we looked for a simple
way to automatically extend the Italian lexicon.
For example, we looked for a way to automati-
cally link relational adjectives with their noun
bases.
Our approach tries to take advantage of only
the lexicon, without the use of any larger re-
sources. To extend the Italian lexicon, we simply
built a routine based on the typical suffixes of
relational adjectives (in Italian: -ale, -are, -ario,
-ano, -ico, -ile, -ino, -ivo, -orio, -esco, -asco,
-iero, -izio, -aceo (Wandruszka 2004)). For every
adjective ending with one of these suffixes, the
routine looks up if the potential base corresponds
to a noun in the rest of the lexicon (modulo some
morphographemic variations). For example, the
routine is able to find links between adjectives
and base nouns such as ambientale and ambiente,
aziendale and azienda, cortisonica and cortisone
or contestuale and contesto. Unfortunately, this
kind of automatic implementation does not find
links between adjectives made from the learned
root of the noun, (prandiale 4 pranzo, bellico
guerra).
This automatic extension has been evaluated.
Out of a total of more than 68 000 adjective
forms in the lexicon, we identified 8 466 rela-
tional adjectives. From a “recall” perspective, it
is not easy to evaluate the coverage of this exten-
sion because of the small number of resources
containing relational adjectives that could be
used as a gold standard.
A similar extension is performed for the
deverbal aspect, for the lexicon should also dis-
tinguish deverbal noun. From a morphological
point of view, deverbalisation can be done trough
two main productive processes: conversion (a
command 4 to command) and suffixation. If the
first one is relatively difficult to implement, the
second one can be easily captured using the typi-
cal suffixes of such processes. Consequently, we
considere that any noun ending with suffixes like
ione, aggio,or mento are deverbal.
Thanks to this extended lexicon, overspecified
input categories (like a_rel for relational ad-
jective or n_dev for deverbal noun) can be
stated and exploited in the implemented LFR as
shown in figure 4.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999285">
5.2 Applying LFRs to translate neologisms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996824947368421">
Once the prototyped MT system was built and
the lexicon adapted, it was applied to a set of
neologisms (see section 6 for details). For exam-
ple, unknown Italian neologisms such as arci-
contento, ridescrizione, deitalianizzare, were
automatically translated in French: archi-content,
redescription, désitalianiser.
The divergences existing in the LFR of &lt;loca-
tive position before&gt; are correctly dealt with,
thanks to the correct analysis of the base. For
example, in the neologism retrobottega, the lex-
eme-base is correctly identified as a locative
noun, and the French equivalent is constructed
with the appropriate prefix (arrière-boutique),
while in retrodiffusione, the base is analysed as
deverbal, and the French equivalent is correctly
generated (rétrodiffusion).
For the analysis of relational adjectives, the
overspecification of the LFRs and the extension
of the lexicon are particularly useful when there
is no French equivalent for Italian relational ad-
jectives because the corresponding construction
is not possible in the French morphological sys-
tem. For example, the Italian relational adjective
aziendale (from the noun azienda, Eng: com-
pany) has no adjectival equivalent in French. The
Italian prefixed adjective interaziendale can only
be translated in French by using a noun as the
base (interentreprise). This translation equivalent
can be found only if the base noun of the Italian
adjective is found (interaziendale, in-
ter+aziendale 4 azienda, azienda = entreprise,
4 interentreprise). The same process has been
applied for the translation of precongressuale,
post-transfuzionale by précongrès, post-
transfusion.
Obviously, all the mechanisms formalised in
this prototype should be carefully evaluated.

As previously stated, the system is intended to
solve neologisms that are unknown from a lexi-
con with LFRs that exploit information contained
in the lexicon. To evaluate the performance of
our system, we built up a corpus of unknown
words by confronting a large Italian corpus from
journalistic domain (La Repubblica Online
(Baroni, Bernardini et al. 2004)) with our refer-
ence lexicon for this language (see section 4.1
above). We obtained a set of unknown words
that contains neologisms, but also proper names
and erroneous items. This set is submitted to the
various steps of the system, where constructed
neologisms are recognised, analysed and trans-
lated.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98727">
6.2 Evaluation of the performance of the
analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970017857143">
As we previously stated, the analysis step can
actually be divided into two tasks. First of all, the
program has to identify, among the unknown
words, which of them are morphologically con-
structed (and so analysable by the LFRs); sec-
ondly, the program has to analyse the constructed
neologisms, i.e matching them with the correct
LFRs and isolating the correct base-words.
For the first task, we obtain a list of 42 673
potential constructed neologisms. Amongst
those, there are a number of erroneous words that
are homographic to a constructed neologism. For
example, the item progesso, a misspelling of
progresso (Eng: progress), is erroneously ana-
lysed as the prefixation of gesso (eng: plaster)
with the LFR in pro.
In the second part of the processing, LFRs are
concretely applied to the potential neologisms
(i.e. constraints on categories and on over-
specified category, phonological constraints).
This stage retains 30 376 neologisms. A manual
evaluation is then performed on these outputs.
Globally, 71.18 % of the analysed words are ac-
tually neologisms. But the performance is not the
same for every rule. Most of them are very effi-
cient: among all the rules for the 56 Italian pre-
fixes, only 7 cause too many erroneous analyses,
and should be excluded - mainly rules with very
short prefixes (like a, di, s), that cause mistakes
due to homograph.
As explained above, some of the rules are
strongly specified, (i.e. very constrained), so we
also evaluate the consequence of some con-
straints, not only in terms of improved perform-
ance but also in terms of loss of information. In-
deed, some of the constraints specified in the rule
exclude some neologisms (false negatives). For
example, the modality LFRs with co and ri have
been overspecified, requiring deverbal base-noun
(and not just a noun). Adding this constraint im-
proves the performance of the analysis (i.e. the
number of correct lexemes analysed), respec-
tively from 69.48 % to 96 % and from 91.21 %
to 99.65 %. Obviously, the number of false nega-
tives (i.e. correct neologisms excluded by the
constraint) is very large (between 50 % and 75 %
of the excluded items).
In this situation, the question is to decide
whether the gain obtained by the constraints (the
improved performance) is more important than
the un-analysed items. In this context, we prefer
to keep the more constrained rule. Un-analysed
items remain unknown words, and the output of
the analysis is almost perfect, which is an impor-
tant condition for the rest of the process (i.e.
transfer and generation).

<bodyText confidence="0.999985379310345">
Generation can also be evaluated according to
two points of view: the correctness of the gener-
ated items, and the improvement brought by the
solved words to the quality of the translated sen-
tence.
To evaluate the first aspect, many procedures
can be put in place. The correctness of con-
structed words could be evaluated by human
judges, but this kind of approach would raise
many questions and biases: people that are not
expert of morphology would judge the correct-
ness according to their degree of acceptability
which varies between judges and is particularly
sensitive when neologism is concerned. Ques-
tions of homogeneity in terms of knowledge of
the domain and of the language are also raised.
Because of these difficulties, we prefer to cen-
tre the evaluation on the existence of the gener-
ated neologisms in a corpus. For neologisms, the
most adequate corpus is the Internet, even if the
use of such an uncontrolled resource requires
some precautions (see (Fradin, Dal et al. 2007)
for a complete debate on the use of web re-
sources in morphology).
Concretely, we use the robot Golf (Thomas
2008) that sends each generated neologism auto-
matically as a request on a search engine (here
Google©) and reports the number of occurrences
as captured by Google. This robot can be param-

eterized, for instance by selecting the appropriate
language.
Because of the uncontrolled aspect of the re-
source, we distinguish three groups of reported
frequencies: 0 occurrence, less than 5 occur-
rences and more than 5. The threshold of 5 helps
to distinguish confirmed existence of neologism
(&gt; 5) from unstable appearances (&lt; 5), that are
closed to hapax phenomena.
The table below summarizes some results for
some prefixed neologisms.

Globally, most of the generated prefixed ne-
ologisms have been found in corpus, and most of
the time with more than 5 occurrences. Unfound
items are very useful, because they help to point
out difficulties or miss-formalised processes.
Most of the unfound neologisms were ill-
analysed items in Italian. Others were due to
misuses of hyphens in the generation. Indeed, in
the program, we originally implemented the use
of the hyphen in French following the estab-
lished norm (i.e. a hyphen is required when the
prefix ends with a vowel and the base starts with
a vowel). But following this “norm”, some forms
were not found in corpus (for example antibra-
connier (Eng: antipoacher) reports 0 occur-
rence). When re-generated with a hyphen, it re-
ports 63 occurrences. This last point shows that
in neology, usage does not stick always to the
norm.
The other problem raised by unknown words
is that they decrease the quality of the translation
of the entire sentence. To evaluate the impact of
the translated unknown words on the translated
sentence, we built up a test-suite of sentences,
each of them containing one prefixed neologism
(in bold in table 2). We then submitted the sen-
tences to a commercial MT system (Systran©)
and recorded the translation and counted the
number of mistakes (FR1 in table 2 below). On a
second step, we “feed” the lexicon of the transla-
tion system with the neologisms and their trans-
lation (generated by our prototype) and resubmit
the same sentences to the system (FR2 in table
2).
For the 60 sentences of the test-suit (21 with
an unknown verb, 19 with an unknown adjective
and 20 with a unknown noun), we then counted
the number of errors before and after the intro-
duction of the neologisms in the lexicon, as
shown below (errors are underlined).

Most of the improvements concern only a re-
duction of 1, i.e. only the unknown word has
been solved. But it should be noticed that im-
provement is more impressive when the un-
known words are nouns or verbs, probably be-
cause these categories influence much more
items in the sentence in terms of agreement.
In two cases (involving verbs), errors are cor-
rected because of the translation of the unknown
words, but at the same time, two other errors are
caused by it. This problem comes from the fact
that adding new words in the lexicon of the sys-
tem requires sometimes more information (such
as valency) to provide a proper syntaxctic gen-
eration of the sentence.

6.4 Evaluation of feasibility and portability
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999936">
The relatively good results obtained by the proto-
type are very encouraging. They mainly show
that if the analysis step is performed correctly,
the rest of the process can be done with not much
further work. But at the end of such a feasibility
study, it is useful to look objectively for the con-
ditions that make such results possible.
The good quality of the result can be ex-
plained by the important preliminary work done
(i) in the extension/specialisation of the lexicon,
and (ii) in the setting up of the LFRs. The acqui-
sition of the contrastive knowledge in a MT con-
text is indeed the most essential issue in this kind
of approach. The methodology we proposed here
for setting these LFR proves to be useful for the

linguist to acquire this specific type of knowl-
edge.
Lexical morphology is often considered as not
regular enough to be exploited in NLP. The
evaluation performed in this study shows that it
is not the case, especially in neologism. But in
some cases, it is no use to ask for the impossible,
and simply give up implementing the most inef-
ficient rules.
We also show that the efficient analysis step is
probably the main condition to make the whole
system work. This step should be implemented
with as much constraints as possible, to provide
an output without errors. Such implementation
requires proper evaluation of the impact of every
constraint.
It should also be stated that such implementa-
tion (and especially knowledge acquisition) is
time-consuming, and one can legitimately ask if
machine-learning methods would do the job. The
number of LFRs being relatively restrained in
producing neologisms, we can say that the effort
of manual formalisation is worthwhile for the
benefits that should be valuable on the long term.
Another aspect of the feasibility is closely related
to questions of “interoperability”, because such
implementation should be done within existing
MT programs, and not independently as it was
for this feasibility study.
Other questions of portability should also be
considered. As we stated, we chose two morpho-
logically related languages on purpose: they pre-
sent less divergences to deal with and allow con-
centrating on the method. However, the proposed
method (especially that contrastive knowledge
acquisition) can clearly be ported to another pair
of languages (at least inflexional languages). It
should also be noticed that the same approach
can be applied to other types of construction. We
mainly think here of suffixation, but one can
imagine to use LFRs with other elements of for-
mation (like combining forms, that tend to be
very “international”, and consequently the mate-
rial for many neologisms). Moreover, the way
the rules are formalised and the algorithm de-
signed allow easy reversibility and modification.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997">
This feasibility study presents the benefit of im-
plementing lexical morphology principles in a
MT system. It presents all the issues raised by
formalization and implementation, and shows in
a quantitative manner how those principles are
useful to partly solve unknown words in machine
translation.
From a broader perspective, we show the
benefits of such implementation in a MT system,
but also the method that should be used to for-
malise this special kind of information. We also
emphasize the need for in-dept work of knowl-
edge acquisition before actually building up the
system, especially because contrastive morpho-
logical data are not as obvious as other linguistic
dimensions.
Moreover, the evaluation step clearly states
that the analysis module is the most important
issue in dealing with lexical morphology in mul-
tilingual context.
The multilingual approach of morphology also
paves the way for other researches, either in rep-
resentation of word-formation or in exploitation
of multilingual dimension in NLP systems.

In cases where the adjective does exist, both forms are possible and seem to be equally used, like in the Italian collaborazione interuniversità / collaborazione interuniversitaria. From a contrastive point of view, the prefixation of relational adjectives exists in both languages (Italian and French) and in both these languages prefixing a noun to create an adjective is also possible (anticostituzione (Adj)). But we notice an important discrepancy in the possibility of constructing relational adjectives (a rough estimation performed on a large bilingual dictionary (Garzanti IT-FR (2006)) shows that more than 1 000 Italian relational adjectives have no equivalent in French (and are generally translated with a prepositional phrase). 131 All these divergences require an in-dept analysis but can be overcome only if the formalism and the implementation process are done following a rigorous methodology. 4.2 The prototype In order to evaluate the approach described above and to concretely investigate the ins and outs of such implementation, we built up a prototype of a machine translation system specialized for constructed neologisms.

To formalise translation rules for prefixed neologisms, we adopt a meaning-to-form approach, i.e. discovering how a constructed meaning is morphologically realised in two languages. We build up a tertium comparationis (a neutral platform, see (James 1980) for details) that constitute a semantic typology of prefixation processes. This typology aims to be universal and therefore applicable to all the languages concerned. On a practical point of view, the typology has been built up by summing up various descriptions of prefixation in various languages (Montermini 2002; Iacobini 2004; Amiot 2005). We end up with six main classes: location, evaluation, quantitative, modality, negation and ingressive. The classes are then subdivided according to sub-meanings: for example, location is subdivided in temporal and spatial, and within spatial location, a distinction is made between different positions (before, above, below, in front, ...). Prefixes of both languages are then literally “projected” (or classified) onto the tertium. For each terminal sub-class, we have a clear picture of the prefixes involved in both languages.

Questions of homogeneity in terms of knowledge of the domain and of the language are also raised. Because of these difficulties, we prefer to centre the evaluation on the existence of the generated neologisms in a corpus. For neologisms, the most adequate corpus is the Internet, even if the use of such an uncontrolled resource requires some precautions (see (Fradin, Dal et al. 2007) for a complete debate on the use of web resources in morphology). Concretely, we use the robot Golf (Thomas 2008) that sends each generated neologism automatically as a request on a search engine (here Google©) and reports the number of occurrences as captured by Google. This robot can be param135 eterized, for instance by selecting the appropriate language. Because of the uncontrolled aspect of the resource, we distinguish three groups of reported frequencies: 0 occurrence, less than 5 occurrences and more than 5. The threshold of 5 helps to distinguish confirmed existence of neologism (&gt; 5) from unstable appearances (&lt; 5), that are closed to hapax phenomena.

Consequently, we looked for a simple way to automatically extend the Italian lexicon. For example, we looked for a way to automatically link relational adjectives with their noun bases. Our approach tries to take advantage of only the lexicon, without the use of any larger resources. To extend the Italian lexicon, we simply built a routine based on the typical suffixes of relational adjectives (in Italian: -ale, -are, -ario, -ano, -ico, -ile, -ino, -ivo, -orio, -esco, -asco, -iero, -izio, -aceo (Wandruszka 2004)). For every adjective ending with one of these suffixes, the routine looks up if the potential base corresponds to a noun in the rest of the lexicon (modulo some morphographemic variations). For example, the routine is able to find links between adjectives and base nouns such as ambientale and ambiente, aziendale and azienda, cortisonica and cortisone or contestuale and contesto. Unfortunately, this kind of automatic implementation does not find links between adjectives made from the learned root of the noun, (prandiale 4 pranzo, bellico guerra). This automatic extension has been evaluated. O</context>
