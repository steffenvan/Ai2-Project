In this paper we address the problem of
identifying reciprocal relationships in English.
In particular we introduce an algorithm that
semi-automatically discovers patterns encod-
ing reciprocity based on a set of simple but
effective pronoun templates. Using a set of
most frequently occurring patterns, we extract
pairs of reciprocal pattern instances by search-
ing the web. Then we apply two unsuper-
vised clustering procedures to form meaning-
ful clusters of such reciprocal instances. The
pattern discovery procedure yields an accu-
racy of 97%, while the clustering procedures
indicate accuracies of 91% and 82%. More-
over, the resulting set of 10,882 reciprocal in-
stances represent a broad-coverage resource.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999939647058823">
Reciprocity is a pervasive concept which has been
studied a lot in a wide variety of fields from ethics
to game theory where it is analyzed as a highly ef-
fective “tit for tat” strategy. The ethic of reciprocity
(also known as the golden rule), for example, is a
moral code born from social interaction: “Do onto
others as you would wish them do onto you”. The
golden rule appears in most religions and cultures as
a standard used to resolve conflicts.
According to sociologists and philosophers, the
concept of reciprocity lies at the foundation of social
organization. It strengthens and maintains social re-
lations among people, beyond the basic exchange of
useful goods. Thus, the way people conceptualize
reciprocity and the way it is expressed in language
play an important role in governing people’s behav-
ior, judgments, and thus their social interactions.
In this paper we present an analysis of the concept
of reciprocity as expressed in English and present a
way to model it. In particular we introduce an al-
gorithm that semi-automatically discovers patterns
encoding reciprocity based on a set of simple but ef-
fective pronoun templates. We then rank the identi-
fied patterns according to a scoring function and se-
lect the most frequent ones. Using these patterns we
query the web and run two unsupervised clustering
procedures to form meaningful clusters of reciprocal
pattern instances. The pattern discovery procedure
yields an accuracy of 97%, while the clustering pro-
cedures indicate accuracies of 91% and 82%. More-
over, the resulting set of 10,882 reciprocal instances
represent a broad-coverage resource.
Next we define the concept of reciprocity as ex-
pressed in English.

The Oxford English Dictionary Online1 defines
reciprocity as “a state or relationship in which there
is mutual action, influence, giving and taking, cor-
respondence, etc., between two parties”, while in
WordNet the verb to reciprocate means “to act, feel,
or give mutually or in return”.
Reciprocity is defined as a relation between two
eventualities eo (original eventuality) and er (recip-
rocated eventuality), which can occur in various re-
ciprocal constructions. Each eventuality is an event2
or a state between two participants. Thus, the rela-

tion of reciprocity R(eo(X, Y), er(Z, W)) describes
a situation where the eventuality er is performed “in
return” for eo. Thus, reciprocity can be seen as a
special type of causal relation.
The two arguments of each eventuality represent
the subject and the object (direct or indirect), in this
order, and they might not all be explicitely stated
in the sentence, but can be inferred. Moreover, the
participants of the two eventualities might or might
not be the same. A few such examples are presented
below with the corresponding reciprocity relations:

As shown in the examples above, in English
there are two basic types of reciprocal construc-
tions: mono-clausal reciprocals (involving words
such as (to) hug, to agree/argue with, partner of, mu-
tual(ly), together, each other – examples (1) and (2))
or sentence-level reciprocals (involving two consec-
utive clauses – examples (3) and (4)). Most of the
sentence-level reciprocals are paraphrased by coor-
dinations or subordinations of two clauses with the
same or different predicate and most of the time in-
verted arguments. They might also manifest various
markers as shown in bold in the examples.
In this paper we focus only on sentence-level con-
structions when the eventualities occur in different
consecutive clauses, and when the subject – object
arguments of each eventuality are personal pronoun
pairs which occur in reverse order in each eventual-
ity. One such example is “She likes him for help-
ing her”. Here the two eventualities are like(she,
he) and help(he, she). In this example, although the
subject of the second verb is not explicitely stated,
it is easily inferred. These simplifying assumptions

will prove very useful in the semi-supervised pat-
tern discovery procedure to ensure the accuracy of
the discovered patterns and their matched instances.
Such a resource of reciprocal event pairs can
be very useful in a number of applications, rang-
ing from question answering and textual entailment
(since reciprocal event pairs encode a type of causal
relation), to behavior analysis of social groups (to
monitor cooperation, trustworthiness and personal-
ity), and behavior prediction in negotiations.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next sec-
tion we present relevant previous work. In Section
3 we detail a semi-supervised approach of extract-
ing patterns which encode reciprocity in English. In
section 4 we extract pairs of reciprocal instances and
cluster them in meaningful clusters. In section 5 we
present the experimental data and results. Discus-
sions and conclusion are presented in Section 6.

Although the concept of reciprocity has been studied
a lot in different disciplines such as social sciences
(Gergen et al., 1980), anthropology (Sahlins, 1972),
economics (Fehr and Gachter, 2000), and philoso-
phy (Becker, 1990), linguists have started to look
deeper into this problem only more recently. More-
over, to the best of our knowledge, in computational
linguistics the problem is novel.
In linguistics, most of the work on reciprocity fo-
cuses on mono-clausal reciprocal constructions, in
particular on the quantifiers each other and one an-
other (Dalrymple et al., 1998; Heim, 1991; K¨onig,
2005). Most of this work has been done by lan-
guage typologists (Maslova and Nedjalkov, 2005;
Haspelmath, 2007) who are interested in how recip-
rocal constructions of these types vary from one lan-
guage to another and they do this through compara-
tive studies of large sets of world’s languages.
In computational linguistics, our pattern discov-
ery procedure extends over previous approaches
that use surface patterns as indicators of semantic
relations between nouns or verbs ((Hearst, 1998;
Chklovski and Pantel, 2004; Etzioni et al., 2004;
Turney, 2006; Davidov and Rappoport, 2008) inter
alia). We extend over these approaches in two ways:
(i) our patterns indicate a new type of relation be-
tween verbs, (ii) instead of seed or hook words we

use a set of simple but effective pronoun templates
which ensure the validity of the patterns extracted.
To the best of our knowledge, the rest of our
reciprocity model is novel. In particular, we use a
novel procedure which extracts pairs of reciprocal
instances and present two novel unsupervised clus-
tering methods which group the instance pairs in
meaningful ways. We also present some interesting
observations on the data thus obtained and suggest
future research directions.

Our algorithm first discovers clusters of patterns in-
dicating reciprocity in English, and then merges the
resulting clusters to identify the final set of recipro-
cal constructions. In this section we detail the algo-
rithm and evaluate it in subsection 5.2.

3.1 Pronoun templates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981613153846154">
In this paper we focus on reciprocal eventualities
which occur in two consecutive clauses and have
two arguments: a subject and an object. One way
to do this is to fully parse each sentence of a corpus
and identify coordinations or subordinations of two
clauses. Then identify the subject and object argu-
ments of each verb in each clause with the help of
a PropBank-style grammatical or semantic role la-
beler (Kingsbury et al., 2002) and make sure they
represent people named entities (as indicated by
proper names, personal pronouns, etc.). Since our
focus is on reciprocal constructions, we also have to
keep in mind that the verbs have to have the same
set of arguments (subject-object) in reverse order.
Thus, noun and pronoun coreference should also be
resolved at this point.
Instead of starting with such a complex and error-
prone preprocessing procedure, our algorithm con-
siders a set of pronoun templates, where personal
pronouns are anchor words (they have to be matched
as such). Each template consists of four personal
pronouns corresponding to a subject - object pair in
one clause, and a subject - object pair in the other
clause. Two such examples are
“[Part1] I [Part2] him [Part3] he [Part4] me [Part5]” and
“[Part1] they [Part2] us [Part3] we [Part4] them [Part5]”,
any sequence of words. This is an elegant proce-
dure since in English, pronouns have different cases
such as nominative and accusative4 which identify
the subject, and respectively the object of an event.
This saves us the trouble of parsing a sentence to
find the grammatical roles of each verb. In English,
there are 30 possible arrangements of nominative -
accusative case personal pronoun pairs. Thus we
built 30 pronoun templates.
This approach is similar to that of seed words
(e.g., (Hearst, 1998)) or hook words (e.g., (Davidov
and Rappoport, 2008)) in previous work. However,
in our case they are fixed and rich in grammatical in-
formation in the sense that they have to correspond
to subject - object pairs in consecutive clauses.
Since the first two pronouns in each pronoun tem-
plate belong to the first clause (C1), and the last two
to the second clause (C2), the templates can be re-
stated as [Part1] C1 [Part3] C2 [Part5], with the re-
striction that partition 3 should not contain any of
the four pronouns in the template. C1 denotes “Pro-
noun1 [Part2] Pronoun2” and C2 denotes “Pronoun3
[Part4] Pronoun4”. Partitions 2 and 4 contain the
verb phrases (and thus the eventualities) we would
like to extract. For speed and memory reasons, we
limit their size to no more than 5 words.
Moreover, since the two clauses are consecutive,
we hypothesize that they should be very close to
each other. Thus, we restrict the size of each par-
tition 1, 3, and 5 to no more than 5 words. We then
consider all possible variations of the pattern where
the size of each partition varies from 0 to 5. This re-
sults in 216 possible combinations (63). Moreover,
to ensure the accuracy of the procedure, partitions 1
and 5 should be bounded to the left and respectively
to the right by punctuation marks, parentheses, or
paragraph boundaries. An example of an instance
matched by one such pattern is “, I cooked dinner
for her and she loves me for that .”

3.2 Scoring function
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99980125">
One way to compute the prominence of the discov-
ered patterns would be to consider the frequency of
each of the five partitions. However, as our pre-

patterns within each partition do often repeat, rank-
ing patterns spanning all three partitions (PART1,
PART3, and PART5) is problematic. Patterns with
relatively long partitions (more than 2 words each)
seldomly occur more than once in the entire corpus.
Thus frequency would produce very little differenti-
ation in ranking the patterns.
Thus we developed an alternative scoring system
in lieu of frequencies. A sequence of size n (seq(n))
is an instance of a pronoun template and a subse-
quence of size k (seq(k)) is simply a substring of the
sequence with k &lt; n. For example, for the instance
“I love her and she loves me , too” of length 9, there
will be two subsequences of length 8: “love her and
she loves me , too” and “I love her and she loves me
,”. Taking into account the frequencies of the subse-
quences occurring within instances of each partition,
we use the following recursive scoring function (n is
the length of each subsequence of size n):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998423">
Score(seq(n)) =
I Disc(freq(seq(n)))+
E
seq(n−1) Disc(Score(seq(n − 1))), if n&gt; 1
freq(seq(n)), if n= 1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999424909090909">
In addition, in order to ensure a valid ranking
over the extracted templates with different lengths
for each partition, we need to normalize the scores
obtained for PART1, PART3, and PART5. In other
words, we need to scale the scores obtained for each
partition to discount the scores of longer partitions,
so that the maximum possible score would remain
the same regardless of how long the partition is.
So we use the following formula to compute the
discount for each of PART1, PART3, and PART5,
where n is the length of the subsequence:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9975026">
Disc(Score(seq(n))) =
� action &amp;quot; −&amp;quot;
(1.0 − fraction) * fraction m−n+1 Iif n&gt; 1
fraction&amp;quot;−&amp;quot;if n= 1 (2)
m−n+1 I
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.988360918918919">
Fraction is an empirically predetermined parame-
ter - here set to 0.5. The variable m is the length of
the entire PART1, PART3, or PART5 in question.
This allows not only the frequency of the exact
pattern to contribute to the score, but also occur-
rences of similar patterns, although to a lesser ex-
tent. And since partitions 1, 3, and 5 constitute the
salient parts of the pattern as the environment for the
two reciprocal clauses C1 and C2, we take the score
to be ranked as Score(PART 1)*Score(PART3)*
Score(PART5).
We searched the 30 pronoun templates with var-
ious partition sizes on a 20 million word English
corpus obtained from Project Gutenberg, the largest
single collection of free electronic books (over
27,000) (http://www.gutenberg.org) and British Na-
tional Corpus (BNC), an 100 million word collec-
tion of English from spoken and written sources.
There were 2,750 instances matched which were
ranked by the scoring function. There were 1,613
distinct types of patterns which generated 1,866 dis-
tinct pattern instances. Thus, we selected the top
15 patterns, after manual validation. These patterns
represent 56% of the data (Table 1). All the other
patterns were discarded as having very low frequen-
cies and being very specific.
The manual validation was necessary in order to
collapse some of the identified instances into more
general classes. For example, the patterns “C1 and
C2 to” (e.g., “He could not hurt me and I would not
wish him to.”), “C1 and C2 in” (e.g., “I give you and
you take me in.”), and “C1 and C2 fast said Aunt
Jane” (e.g., “He will come to her and she can hold
him fast said Aunt Jane.”) were collapsed into “C1
and C2”. This procedure can be partially solved by
identifying complex verbs such as “take in”. How-
ever, we leave this improvement for future work.

4 Clustering of Reciprocal Eventualities
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998946">
It seems reasonable to expect that certain reciproc-
ities could be grouped together. For example, the
language used in convincing a person of some-
thing could be characterized by verbs such as
eo = {convince, promise, assure, beg} and er =
{believe, trust, choose, forgive}.
There are many potential uses for this sort of
grouping. Having a single group label for multiple
reciprocal eventuality pairs would allow us to iden-
tify certain language patterns as a particular speech
act. Also, such clusters could be useful if one wants
to perform a macro-level analysis of reciprocity in a
specific domain. For example, examining reciprocal
language could be useful in analyzing the nature of
a social community or the theme of a literary work.
Generalizing over many similar instances, will give
us better insight into how people communicate – as
reactions (effects) to other people’s actions (causes).
Thus, in this section we present a model for clus-
tering the eventualities we extract through the pro-
cess described in the previous sections. Experimen-
tal results are presented in Section 5.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998743">
4.1 Representing the data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999020590909091">
After obtaining these patterns, we must extract pairs
of eventualities of the form (eo, er). This involves
both reducing the clauses into a form that is seman-
tically representative of some eventuality, as well as
determining the order of the two eventualities (i.e.,
if they are asymmetric).
As shown in the previous sections, each pat-
tern contains two clauses of the form “Pronouni
[Part2/4] Pronounj”, where the first pronouns is
the subject and the second is the object. From
each clause we extract only the non-auxiliary verb,
as it carries the most meaning. We first stem the
verb and then negate it if it is preceded by not or
n’t. For example, “They do not like him because
he snubbed them” is represented as the eventualities
(eo, er) = (snub, ¬like).
Certainly, we are missing important information
by excluding phrases and ignoring modality. How-
ever, these features can be difficult to capture accu-
rately, and since inaccurate input could degrade the
clustering accuracy, in this research we stick with
the important and easily-obtainable features.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995757">
4.2 Ordering the eventualities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984666666666">
Most patterns entail a particular ordering of the two
eventualities, corresponding to symmetric (e.g., “He
loves her and she loves him”) or asymmetric eventu-
alities (e.g., “He ignores her when she scolds him”).
In ambiguous situations (e.g., He loves her and she
loves him” and “He cheated on her and she still
loves him!”), we determine the order through clues
such as the relative temporal ordering of the verbs as
determined by their tense (e.g., past or present tense
happens before future tense) and whether the verbs
denote an action (e.g., “to chase”) or a state (e.g.,
“to love”). For this we rely on our previous work
(Girju, 2009) where we identified the order of even-
tualities based on a set of such features employed in
a semi-supervised model whose accuracy is 90.2%.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999285">
4.3 Modeling the relationships
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998937961538462">
The extracted eventuality pairs can be represented
as a bipartite graph with a node for all eo values
in one partition, a node for all er values in another
partition, and an edge between these nodes for each
(eo, er) pair. An intuitive way to cluster these even-
tualities is to find groups of nodes such that each
node in one partition has an edge to every node in
the other partition and vice versa. This is a form of
hard-clustering, as membership in a cluster is strictly
yes or no. The goal is that one could randomly pull
an eo and an er from a given cluster and the reci-
procity would be valid. For example, “help” and
“give” could both be reciprocated by either “thank”
or “like”. Thus, given a cluster, not only is there a
reciprocal relationship between verbs in the eo group
with the verbs in the er group, but there is often
a kind of similarity relationship between the verbs
within each eo or er group.
This approach gives precise and concrete relations
between verbs, but while it could be well-suited
to some applications (such as knowledge base con-
struction or automatic verb classification (Joanis et
al., 2008)5) it has disadvantages in the context of
grouping these verbs together. The clusters are small
and sparse, and the results are difficult to interpret,
as there are many overlapping clusters.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.990959333333333">
5These verb classes correspond to some extent to the Verb-
Net (Kipper et al., 2000) or FrameNet-style (Baker et al., 1998)
verb classes such as admire, judgment.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999562">
We instead adopt a probabilistic framework,
which allows us to relax the restrictiveness of
the clusters while retaining information about the
strength of the pairwise relations. Thus, we design
a bimodal mixture model in which we assume that
each pair of eventualities (eo, er) belongs to a latent
class z, and each class is associated with two distinct
multinomial distributions from which the two even-
tualities are independently drawn. Thus, the proba-
bility of generating a particular pair is:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.991875333333333">
|Z|
P(eo, er) = E P(eo|z = k)P(er|z = k) (3)
k
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949">
Each class can be thought of as a general type of
reciprocity, such as an action followed by apprecia-
tion, or an attack followed by retaliation. We should
be clear that each class is characterized not by a dis-
tribution of specific pairs, but by a distribution of
eo verbs and a distribution of er verbs. This allows
for the classification of (eo, er) pairs that do not ap-
pear in the corpus. For example, if we have not seen
the pair (slap, punch), but we know that (slap, hit)
and (kick, punch) belong to the same class, then it
is likely that (slap, punch) is in the same group.
This model can be used in a fully supervised as
well as a semi-/unsupervised setting. If some or
all of the class labels are unknown, we can learn
the model parameters using an estimator such as
Expectation-Maximization (EM) (Dempster et al.,
1977). For each eventuality pair ci in a collection
C, we update P(z = k|ci) with the following equa-
tion, which represents the E-step:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.945267666666667">
P(z|ci) ∝ P(z)P(e(ci)
o |z)P(e(ci)
r |z) (4)
In the M-step, we use the following update equa-
tions:
P(z = k) ∝ α + � |C |P(z = k|ci) (5)
i
P(eo = j|z) = 0 + �|C|
i I(e(ci)
o = j)P(z|ci)
|Eo|0 + Ej, Ei I (e(ci) = j0)P(z |ci)
(6)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999690625">
where I is a binary indicator function. The equa-
tion for P(er = j|z) is identical to that for eo, but
with er instead6.
α and 0 are the hyperparameters of the uniform
Dirichlet priors of P(z) and P(e∗|z). They can
be tuned to control the level of smoothing; a value
of 1.0 is equivalent to the commonly-used Laplace

4.4 Identifying polarity words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956625">
Since we are interested in analyzing how people in-
teract, we would also like to identify the polarity
(affective value) associated with each eventuality.
Thus, we automatically identify polarity words in
both clauses. For this we consider the standard po-
larity values: Good, Bad, and Neutral.
In the next section we present in detail the results
of the evaluation.

While the Gutenberg and BNC collections are use-
ful in obtaining the frequent patterns, they do not
contain a very large number of eventuality pairs
to do meaningful clustering. We thus query the
web through Google to easily obtain thousands of
examples. We queried each of the top 15 pat-
terns and all pronoun combinations thereof (e.g.
“they * us because we * them”) and took the top
500 results for each pattern/pronoun combination
(15*30*500)7. We then extracted the clauses from
the result snippets using the procedure outlined in
the previous section and ended up with 10,882 pairs

5.2 Pattern discovery procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988153846154">
Since we wanted to see to what extent the 15 most
frequently occurring patterns encode reciprocity, we
selected a sample of 10 pattern instances matched
by each pattern in the text collection obtained from
the web. We presented the resulting 130 sentences
(a few patterns were not frequent on the web, so we
obtained a few less than 10 instances) to 2 judges
who evaluated them as encoding reciprocity (’yes’)
or not (’no’). The judges agreed 97% of the time.
Moreover, only 2.3% of the 130 pattern instances
did not encode reciprocity as agreed by both judges.
These statistics show that these patterns are highly
accurate indicators of reciprocity in English.

5.3 Unsupervised clustering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993524307692308">
We can capture pattern instance clusters with no
prior labeling by initializing the EM parameters ran-
domly. In our experiments we used α = 1.0 and
Q = 0.01, with varying numbers of clusters (which
we denote as k). EM is sensitive to the initial pa-
rameters and can perform poorly due to many local
maxima. We thus ran the algorithm several times,
and saved the output with the best log-likelihood.
Results from clustering with k = 6 are shown
in Table 2. The examples shown correspond to a
random sample of 10 pairs within the top 10% of
P(eo, er|cluster) within each cluster. We find that
with larger values of k such as 30 or 50, some of the
clusters become noisier, but we can capture finer-
grained clusters such as eo = {libel, defame} and
er = {sue, ¬sue}.
Upon a close look at the clusters in Table 2, one
can see that each one seems to have a central theme.
Cluster 1 seems to contain mostly positive actions
reciprocated by verbs describing gratitude and ap-
preciation. Cluster 2 has to do with cognition; Clus-
ter 3 has to do with the way people communicate and
interact. Cluster 4 captures relationships of need and
desire. Cluster 5 is about love and adoration, while
Cluster 6 is about hate and other negative events, and
how they are reciprocated.

Cluster membership is defined as argmaxc
P(eo|c) P(er|c). We took three samples of pairs:
(1) the top 20 pairs with the highest P (eo, er|c) val-
ues, (2) a random 20 of the top 10%, and (3) a ran-
dom 20 of all pairs assigned to each cluster. We pre-
sented the pairs to two judges who were asked to
identify each pair as belonging to the cluster or not
based on coherence; that is, all pairs labeled ”yes”
appear to be related in some way.
Because we fix the number of clusters, we are
making the assumption that each reciprocal pair
could be put into one of k groups, which is obviously
an assumption that will not hold true. However, if a
pair does not fit well into any of the clusters, this
should be reflected by a low probability. Thus we
can achieve decently high accuracy if we consider
only the highest-ranked pairs. The accuracy when
considering all pairs is only 34% which means that
34% of reciprocal pairs can be meaningfully placed
into only 6 groups, which is actually fairly high.
A big source of inter-annotator disagreement
comes from the ambiguity of certain verbs, which
is a weakness of our limited representation. For ex-
ample, without additional information it is not clear
how a pair like (know, ask) might relate to others.

For this procedure we used the Subjectivity Clues
(Wilson et al., 2005) which provides 8,220 entries.
From all the 10,882 eventuality pairs, 40.1% of the
total number of words were in the subjectivity lexi-
con, while 36.9% of the pairs had both words in the
subjectivity lexicon.
Table 4 shows all possible combinations of pairs
of affective values and their associated probabilities
in the corpus. These values are computed for those
pairs where both words have known polarity.
As one might expect, each polarity class is most
likely to be reciprocated by itself: Good for Good
(altruism) and Bad for Bad (retaliation). Further-
more, it is more likely that Good follows Bad (’turn

We experimented with incorporating polarity into
our clustering process. We defined 9 clusters for
each combination of polarity pairs, and initialized
the model by labeling the eventuality pairs where
the polarity of both words was known. We then
ran the EM process on all of the pairs, and since
the model parameters were initialized with these 9
groups, their pairs were more likely to fit into clus-
ters that matched their polarity. We found, how-
ever, that it had trouble clustering the less-common
classes – essentially, everything but (Good, Good)
and (Bad, Bad). For example, the cluster that was
initialized as (Bad, Good) ended up being dominated
by er = thanks and mostly positive-polarity words
as eo. This seems to be due to the fact that many of
these pairs included er = thanks (often in sarcasm,
as in “he thanked them for embarrassing him”). But
there are many more words associated with thanks
that are Good, thus those pairs were put into the
same group, and the Good verbs eventually overtook
the cluster. Problems such as this could perhaps be
avoided with more varied labeled data.
We selected a sample of the top 20 pair instances
for each of the 9 clusters of polarity pairs and gave
them to 2 judges who agreed 82% of the time.

6 Discussion and Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999796705882353">
In this paper we presented an analysis of the concept
of reciprocity as expressed in English and a way to
model it. The experimental results provided nice in-
sights into the problem, but can be further improved.
We noticed that the identification of polarity
words is not always enough to capture the affect of
each eventuality. Thus, the text needs to be further
processed to identify speech acts corresponding to
each clause in the reciprocal patterns. For exam-
ple, words such as “sorry” can be classified as neg-
ative, while the entire clause “I am sorry” captures
the speech act of APOLOGY which is associated with
good intentions. As future work, we will recluster
the reciprocity pairs.
Another observation concerns the reciprocity
property of magnitude (cf. (Jackendoff, 2005))
or equivalence of value between two eventualities.
Most of the time reciprocal eventualities have the
same or similar magnitude, as the patterns identified
indicate a more or less equivalence of value – i.e.,
hugs for kisses, thanks for help. And most of these
constructions do not focus so much on the magni-
tude, but on the order in which one eventuality (the
effect) is a reaction to the other (the cause). How-
ever, a closer look at our data shows that there are
also constructions which indicate this property more
precisely. One such example is “C1 as much as C2”
where even a negation in C1 or C2 might destroy the
magnitude balance (e.g., “She does not love him as
much as he loves her.”).
We would like to study this property in more de-
tail as well. This kind of study is very important
in the analysis of people’s behavior, judgments, and
thus their social interactions.

This is an elegant procedure since in English, pronouns have different cases such as nominative and accusative4 which identify the subject, and respectively the object of an event. This saves us the trouble of parsing a sentence to find the grammatical roles of each verb. In English, there are 30 possible arrangements of nominative - accusative case personal pronoun pairs. Thus we built 30 pronoun templates. This approach is similar to that of seed words (e.g., (Hearst, 1998)) or hook words (e.g., (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008)) in previous work. However, in our case they are fixed and rich in grammatical information in the sense that they have to correspond to subject - object pairs in consecutive clauses. Since the first two pronouns in each pronoun template belong to the first clause (C1), and the last two to the second clause (C2), the templates can be restated as [Part1] C1 [Part3] C2 [Part5], with the restriction that partition 3 should not contain any of the four pronouns in the template.

This allows for the classification of (eo, er) pairs that do not appear in the corpus. For example, if we have not seen the pair (slap, punch), but we know that (slap, hit) and (kick, punch) belong to the same class, then it is likely that (slap, punch) is in the same group. This model can be used in a fully supervised as well as a semi-/unsupervised setting. If some or all of the class labels are unknown, we can learn the model parameters using an estimator such as Expectation-Maximization (EM) (Dempster et al., 1977). For each eventuality pair ci in a collection C, we update P(z = k|ci) with the following equation, which represents the E-step: P(z|ci) ∝ P(z)P(e(ci) o |z)P(e(ci) r |z) (4) In the M-step, we use the following update equations: P(z = k) ∝ α + � |C |P(z = k|ci) (5) i P(eo = j|z) = 0 + �|C| i I(e(ci) o = j)P(z|ci) |Eo|0 + Ej, Ei I (e(ci) = j0)P(z |ci) (6) where I is a binary indicator function. The equation for P(er = j|z) is identical to that for eo, but with er instead6. α and 0 are the hyperparameters of the uniform Dirichlet priors of P(z) and P(e∗|z).

In ambiguous situations (e.g., He loves her and she loves him” and “He cheated on her and she still loves him!”), we determine the order through clues such as the relative temporal ordering of the verbs as determined by their tense (e.g., past or present tense happens before future tense) and whether the verbs denote an action (e.g., “to chase”) or a state (e.g., “to love”). For this we rely on our previous work (Girju, 2009) where we identified the order of eventualities based on a set of such features employed in a semi-supervised model whose accuracy is 90.2%. 4.3 Modeling the relationships The extracted eventuality pairs can be represented as a bipartite graph with a node for all eo values in one partition, a node for all er values in another partition, and an edge between these nodes for each (eo, er) pair. An intuitive way to cluster these eventualities is to find groups of nodes such that each node in one partition has an edge to every node in the other partition and vice versa.

This is an elegant procedure since in English, pronouns have different cases such as nominative and accusative4 which identify the subject, and respectively the object of an event. This saves us the trouble of parsing a sentence to find the grammatical roles of each verb. In English, there are 30 possible arrangements of nominative - accusative case personal pronoun pairs. Thus we built 30 pronoun templates. This approach is similar to that of seed words (e.g., (Hearst, 1998)) or hook words (e.g., (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008)) in previous work. However, in our case they are fixed and rich in grammatical information in the sense that they have to correspond to subject - object pairs in consecutive clauses. Since the first two pronouns in each pronoun template belong to the first clause (C1), and the last two to the second clause (C2), the templates can be restated as [Part1] C1 [Part3] C2 [Part5], with the restriction that partition 3 should not contain any of the four pronouns in the template.

We noticed that the identification of polarity words is not always enough to capture the affect of each eventuality. Thus, the text needs to be further processed to identify speech acts corresponding to each clause in the reciprocal patterns. For example, words such as “sorry” can be classified as negative, while the entire clause “I am sorry” captures the speech act of APOLOGY which is associated with good intentions. As future work, we will recluster the reciprocity pairs. Another observation concerns the reciprocity property of magnitude (cf. (Jackendoff, 2005)) or equivalence of value between two eventualities. Most of the time reciprocal eventualities have the same or similar magnitude, as the patterns identified indicate a more or less equivalence of value – i.e., hugs for kisses, thanks for help. And most of these constructions do not focus so much on the magnitude, but on the order in which one eventuality (the effect) is a reaction to the other (the cause). However, a closer look at our data shows that there are also constructions which indicate this property more precisely. One such example is “C1 as much as C2” where even a negation in C1 or</context>

One way to do this is to fully parse each sentence of a corpus and identify coordinations or subordinations of two clauses. Then identify the subject and object arguments of each verb in each clause with the help of a PropBank-style grammatical or semantic role labeler (Kingsbury et al., 2002) and make sure they represent people named entities (as indicated by proper names, personal pronouns, etc.). Since our focus is on reciprocal constructions, we also have to keep in mind that the verbs have to have the same set of arguments (subject-object) in reverse order. Thus, noun and pronoun coreference should also be resolved at this point. Instead of starting with such a complex and errorprone preprocessing procedure, our algorithm considers a set of pronoun templates, where personal pronouns are anchor words (they have to be matched as such).

Most of this work has been done by language typologists (Maslova and Nedjalkov, 2005; Haspelmath, 2007) who are interested in how reciprocal constructions of these types vary from one language to another and they do this through comparative studies of large sets of world’s languages. In computational linguistics, our pattern discovery procedure extends over previous approaches that use surface patterns as indicators of semantic relations between nouns or verbs ((Hearst, 1998; Chklovski and Pantel, 2004; Etzioni et al., 2004; Turney, 2006; Davidov and Rappoport, 2008) inter alia). We extend over these approaches in two ways: (i) our patterns indicate a new type of relation between verbs, (ii) instead of seed or hook words we 76 use a set of simple but effective pronoun templates which ensure the validity of the patterns extracted. To the best of our knowledge, the rest of our reciprocity model is novel. In particular, we use a novel procedure which extracts pairs of reciprocal instances and present two novel unsupervised clustering methods which group the instance pairs in meaningful ways. We also present some interesting obse</context>

The accuracy when considering all pairs is only 34% which means that 34% of reciprocal pairs can be meaningfully placed into only 6 groups, which is actually fairly high. A big source of inter-annotator disagreement comes from the ambiguity of certain verbs, which is a weakness of our limited representation. For example, without additional information it is not clear how a pair like (know, ask) might relate to others. 5.4 Polarity word identification For this procedure we used the Subjectivity Clues (Wilson et al., 2005) which provides 8,220 entries. From all the 10,882 eventuality pairs, 40.1% of the total number of words were in the subjectivity lexicon, while 36.9% of the pairs had both words in the subjectivity lexicon. Table 4 shows all possible combinations of pairs of affective values and their associated probabilities in the corpus. These values are computed for those pairs where both words have known polarity. As one might expect, each polarity class is most likely to be reciprocated by itself: Good for Good (altruism) and Bad for Bad (retaliation). Furthermore, it is more likely that Good follows Ba</context>
