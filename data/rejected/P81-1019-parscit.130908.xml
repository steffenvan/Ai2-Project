The question of how people resolve pronouns has the various factors combine. Certainly it is important
been of interest to language theorists for a long time
because so much of what goes an when people find
referents for pronouns seems to lie at the heart of
comprehension. However, despite the relevance of pro-
nouns for comprehension and language theory, the
processes that contribute to pronoun resolution have
proved notoriously difficult to pin down.
Part of the difficulty arises from the wide range
of factors that can affect which antecedent noun phrase
in a text is understood to be co-referential with a
particular pronoun. These factors can range from simple
number/gender agreement through selectional restrictions
to quite complex knowledge that has been acquired from
the text (see Webber,(1978) for a neatly illustrated
description of many of these factors). Research in
psychology, artificial intelligence and linguistics has
gone a long way toward identifying some of these factors
and their role in pronoun resolution. For instance, in
psychology, research carried out by Caramazza and his
colleagues (Caramazza et al, 1977) as well as research
that I have done (Ehrlich, 1980), has demonstrated that
number/gender agreement really can function to constrain
the choice of referent in a way that significantly
facilitates processing. Within an AI framework, there
has been some very interesting work carried out by
Sidner (1977) and Grosz (1977) that seeks to identify
the current topic of a text and to show that knowledge
of the topic can considerably simplify pronoun reso-
lution.
It is important that people are able to select
appropriate referents for pronouns and to have some
basis for that decision. The research discussed so far
has mentioned some of the factors that contribute co
those decisions. However, part of the problem of really
understanding how people resolve pronouns is knowing how
and useful to point to a particular factor as contri-
buting to a reference decision, but in many texts more
than one of these factors will be available to a reader
or listener. One problem for the theorist is then to
explain which factor predominates in the decision as
well as to describe the scheduling of evaluation pro-
cedures. If it could be shown that there was a strict
ordering in which tests were applied, say, number/gender
agreement followed by selectional restrictions followed
by inference procedures, pronoun resolution may be simp-
ler to explain. At our present level of knowledge it is
difficult to discern ordering principles that have may
degree of generality. For instance, for every example
where the topic seems to determine choice, a similar
example can often be found where the more recent ante-
cedent is preferred over the one that forms part of the
topic. Moreover, even this claim begs the question of
hod the topic can be identified unambiguously.
A different approach is possible. The process of
assigning a referent to a pronoun can be viewed as
utilizing two kinds of strategies. One strategy is con-
cerned with selecting the best referent from amongst the
candidates available. The other strategy is concerned
with searching through memory for the candidates.
These two types of strategy, which will be referred to
mnemonically as inference and search strategies, have
different kinds of characteristics. A search strategy
dictates the order in which candidates are evaluated,
but has no machinery for carrying out the evaluation.
The inference strategy helps to set up the represen-
tation of the information in the text against which can-
didates can be evaluated, but has no way of finding the
candidates. In the rest of this paper, the way these
strategies might interact will be explored and the
results of two studies will be reported that bear on

the issues.
One possible search strategy is to examine can-
didates serially beginning with the one mentioned most
recently and working back through the text. This
strategy makes some sense because, as Hobbs (1978) has
pointed out, most pronouns co-refer with antecedents
that were mentioned within the last few sentences.
Thus, a serial search strategy provides a principled
way of restricting how a text is searched. Moreover,
there is some evidence from psychological research that
it takes longer to resolve pronouns when the antecedent
with which the pronoun co-refers is far rather than near
the pronoun (e.g. Clark &amp; Sengul, 1979; Springston,
1975). Although such distance effects have been used
to argue for differences in memory retrieval, with the
nearer antecedents being easier to retrieve than the
further ones, none of the reported data rule out a
serial search strategy.
As argued earlier, a search strategy alone cannot
account for pronoun resolution because it lacks any
machinery for evaluation. There are, however, many
kinds of information that people can bring to bear when
evaluating candidates and some of these were discussed
earlier. A common method is to decide between alter-
native candidates on the basis of information gained
through inferences. Inference is a rather ubiquitous
and often ill-defined notion, and, although it is beyond
the scope of this paper to clarify the concept, it is
worth noting that there are (at least) two kinds of
inference that play a role in anaphora generally. One
kind which I will call &apos;lexical&apos; inferences are drawn
to establish that WO different linguistic expressions
refer to the same entity. For instance, in the follow-
ing pair of sentences from Garrod and Sanford (1977):
(I) A bus came roaring round the corner
The vehicle nearly flattened a pedestrian
a &apos;lexical&apos; inference establishes that the particular
vehicle mentioned in the second sentence is in fact a
bus. Inferences can also be drawn to support the
selection of one referent over another. In a sentence
such as:
(2) John sold a car to Fred because he needed it
a series of inferences based in part on out knowledge of
selling and needing, supports the selection of Fred
rather than John as referent for the pronoun &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;. In
the experiments to be reported, it was &apos;lexical&apos;
inferences rather than the other kind that were mani-
pulated.
Subjects in the experiment were asked to read texts
such as the one given below:
(3) Fred was outside all day
John was inside all day
a) He had a sleep inside after lunch
b) He had a sleep in his room after lunch
and then immediately after, answer a question such as
&amp;quot;Who had a sleep after lunch?&amp;quot; that was designed to
elicit the referent of the pronoun in the last sentence.
Two factors were independently varied. The antecedent
could be near or far from the pronoun, the latter
effected by switching the order of the first two sen-
tences. The second factor was whether a &apos;bridging&apos;
inference had to be drawn to establish co-reference
between part of the predicate of the last sentence and
the target sentence. The two versions, (a) no inference
and (b) inference, are shown as alternative third sen-
tences in example (3) above. The principal measures
were the time to answer the question and the accuracy of
the response.
The experiment addresses two critical issues. One
is whether the &apos;lexical&apos; inference is drawn as part of
the evaluation procedure, or, whether it is drawn in-
dependently of that process. The other issue concerns
the search strategy itself: do subjects examine can-
didates serially, and, if so, do they still use other
criteria to reject the first candidate and choose the
second? Two distinct models of processing can be con-
structed from a consideration of these issues. In the
case where inferences are triggered by the need to
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999478025641026">
evaluate a candidate, any effect due to extra processing
should be unaffected by whether the antecedent is near
or far from the pronoun. In either case the inference
will be drawn in response to the need to decide an the
acceptability of the candidate. In the second model,
the inference is triggered by the anaphoric expression,
e.g. &amp;quot;in his DOOM&amp;quot; in the third sentence, and the need
to relate that expression to the location &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot; men-
tioned in a previous sentence. The inference is ex-
pected to take a certain amount of time to be drawn
(cf. Kintsch, 1974). According to the second model,
one would expect that in cases where the antecedent is
near the pronoun, there will be some effect due to
inference because the process may not be completed in
time to answer the question. When the antecedent is far
from the pronoun, however, the inference process will
be completed and hence no effect of inference should
still be detected. The two models assume rationality on
the part of the subjects; that is, they assume that
subjects will accurately select the further antecedent
where appropriate even though recency would predict
selection of the first candidate that is evaluated. If
this assumption is valid, subjects should select the
far antecedent where appropriate more often than the
(erroneous) near candidate.
The results of the experiment, shown in Table 1,
support the second model; &apos;lexical&apos; inferences are
drawn only once and in response to an anaphoric expres-
sion. The data also provide evidence of a serial search
strategy by showing that there are more errors and
longer latencies associated with far rather than near
antecedents. The data further show that even when the
correct choice is far from the pronoun, subjects will
choose it in preference to the nearer candidate, thus
demonstrating that a serial search strategy alone can-
not predict the choice of referent.
The inferences that subjects had to draw in this
experiment concerned simple lexical relations. The
increase in latency due to having drawn such an infer-
sate supports the results of earlier studies, par-
ticularly those of Garrod and Sanford (1977). What the
present study fails to do, however, is to determine
whether that inference is drawn spontaneously, while
reading. Previous research (e.g., Kintsch, 1974, Garrod
and Sanford, 1977) has shown that inferences are more
likely to be drawn while reading than at a response
stage. It was thus of some interest to know when the
lexical inferences in the present study were drawn.
This issue was examined by modifying the previous ex-
periment to include both an additional measure of read-
ing time and a 1.5s delay between presentation and test.
The latter modification is important since if subjects
are drawing inferences while reading, the process may
not be completed by the time the question is asked
immediately after presentation. The introduction of a
delay also allows for a further test of the two pro-
cessing modeled outlined earlier. If indeed &apos;lexical&apos;
inferences are drawn to establish co-reference between
anaphoric expressions rather than to determine pro-
nominal reference, as the previous experiment indicated,
then there should be an effect of inference on reading
time but not at response when there is a delay, because
by response the inference should have been drawn. The
data were consistent with this hypothesis. However,
what also emerged from the second study was that only
some of the passages seemed to elicit inferences at
reading; the nunber of passages was increased in the
second experiment to counter possible repetition
effects. In fact, for half the passages subjects res-
ponded by saying there was no answer. An example of
such a passage is given below:
(4) Jill had a newspaper in the living-room
Ann had a book in the living-room
She read some chemistry in the evening
It was also the case for these passages that the in-
ferences did not seem to be drawn while reading but
rather in response to the question. There is some
doubt here about cause and effect, nevertheless, the

observation raises some interesting questions con-
cerning what triggers an inference to be drawn. One
answer, supplied by Garrod 6 Sanford in their experi-
ments, is that a relation between expressions must
somehow be perceived before an inference is drawn to
determine the nature of the relation. In other words,
people do not draw inferences randomly to relate lin-
guistic expressions. Thus, whereas Garrod E. Sanford
found that subjects would infer co-reference between
&amp;quot;bus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;vehicle&amp;quot; in example (1), they failed to make
that connection, quite rightly, in a similar passage
shown below:
(5) A bus came roaring round the corner
It nearly smashed some vehicles
What kinds of strategies do readers adopt when
they search their memory to find plausible referents
for pronouns? Results of the experiments reported here
point to a strategy in which entities are examined
serially from the pronoun. The purpose of a serial
search strategy is to provide a principled way in which
readers can examine those entities they have stored in
memory, for their appropriateness as the referent of a
particular pronoun. The strategy is thus unnecessary
when there is only one entity in memory by virtue of
simple criteria such as number and gender agreement
with the pronoun. What cawstitutes &apos;simple&apos; criteria
is, of course, an open question; the answer, however,
will materially affect the applicability of the search
strategy.
The most important part of reference resolution is,
however, deciding on the referent. A serial search
strategy has no machinery for evaluating candidates, it
can only direct the order in which candidates are
examined. The process of selecting a plausible referent
depends on the inferences a reader has drawn while the
text is read. Thus, when subjects found it hard to
select a referent at all they also failed to draw many
inferences while they read the text. Moreover, because
the inferences for these passages did seem to be drawn
in response to a question eliciting the referent, the
implication is that inferences for the clearer material
are generally drawn spontaneously and before a specific
need for the information arises. One can conjecture
from these data that the selection of plausible refer-
ents is dependent on how well a reader has understood
the preceding text. If inferences are not drawn until
a specific need arises, such as finding a referent, then
it may be too late, to select a referent easily or
accurately. Thus, reference can also be viewed in terms
of what a text makes available for anaphoric reference
(cf. Webber, 1978).
The picture of pronoun &apos;resolution that emerges
from the studies reported here, is one in which effects
of distance between the pronoun and its antecedent may
play some role, not as a predicator of pronominal
reference as has often been thought, but as part of a
search strategy. There certainly are cases where nearer
antecedents seem to be preferred over ones further back
in the text; however, it is more profitable to look to
concepts such as foregrounding (cf. Chafe, 1974) rather
than simple recency for explanations of the preference.
• It is also of same interest to have shown that infer-
ences may contribute to pronoun resolution but drawn
for other reasons.

For instance, in psychology, research carried out by Caramazza and his colleagues (Caramazza et al, 1977) as well as research that I have done (Ehrlich, 1980), has demonstrated that number/gender agreement really can function to constrain the choice of referent in a way that significantly facilitates processing.

A common method is to decide between alternative candidates on the basis of information gained through inferences. Inference is a rather ubiquitous and often ill-defined notion, and, although it is beyond the scope of this paper to clarify the concept, it is worth noting that there are (at least) two kinds of inference that play a role in anaphora generally. One kind which I will call &apos;lexical&apos; inferences are drawn to establish that WO different linguistic expressions refer to the same entity. For instance, in the following pair of sentences from Garrod and Sanford (1977): (I) A bus came roaring round the corner The vehicle nearly flattened a pedestrian a &apos;lexical&apos; inference establishes that the particular vehicle mentioned in the second sentence is in fact a bus. Inferences can also be drawn to support the selection of one referent over another. In a sentence such as: (2) John sold a car to Fred because he needed it a series of inferences based in part on out knowledge of selling and needing, supports the selection of Fred rather than John as referent for the pronoun &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;. In the experiments to be reported, it was &apos;lexical&apos; inferences rather than the other ki</context>

The data further show that even when the correct choice is far from the pronoun, subjects will choose it in preference to the nearer candidate, thus demonstrating that a serial search strategy alone cannot predict the choice of referent. The inferences that subjects had to draw in this experiment concerned simple lexical relations. The increase in latency due to having drawn such an infersate supports the results of earlier studies, particularly those of Garrod and Sanford (1977). What the present study fails to do, however, is to determine whether that inference is drawn spontaneously, while reading. Previous research (e.g., Kintsch, 1974, Garrod and Sanford, 1977) has shown that inferences are more likely to be drawn while reading than at a response stage. It was thus of some interest to know when the lexical inferences in the present study were drawn. This issue was examined by modifying the previous experiment to include both an additional measure of reading time and a 1.5s delay between presentation and test. The latter modification is important since if subjects</context>

The inference strategy helps to set up the representation of the information in the text against which candidates can be evaluated, but has no way of finding the candidates. In the rest of this paper, the way these strategies might interact will be explored and the results of two studies will be reported that bear on 89 the issues. One possible search strategy is to examine candidates serially beginning with the one mentioned most recently and working back through the text. This strategy makes some sense because, as Hobbs (1978) has pointed out, most pronouns co-refer with antecedents that were mentioned within the last few sentences. Thus, a serial search strategy provides a principled way of restricting how a text is searched. Moreover, there is some evidence from psychological research that it takes longer to resolve pronouns when the antecedent with which the pronoun co-refers is far rather than near the pronoun (e.g. Clark &amp; Sengul, 1979; Springston, 1975). Although such distance effects have been used to argue for differences in memory retrieval, with the nearer antecedents being easier to retrieve than the fur</context>

In either case the inference will be drawn in response to the need to decide an the acceptability of the candidate. In the second model, the inference is triggered by the anaphoric expression, e.g. &amp;quot;in his DOOM&amp;quot; in the third sentence, and the need to relate that expression to the location &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot; mentioned in a previous sentence. The inference is expected to take a certain amount of time to be drawn (cf. Kintsch, 1974). According to the second model, one would expect that in cases where the antecedent is near the pronoun, there will be some effect due to inference because the process may not be completed in time to answer the question. When the antecedent is far from the pronoun, however, the inference process will be completed and hence no effect of inference should still be detected. The two models assume rationality on the part of the subjects; that is, they assume that subjects will accurately select the further antecedent where appropriate even though recency would predict selection of the first candid</context>

One can conjecture from these data that the selection of plausible referents is dependent on how well a reader has understood the preceding text. If inferences are not drawn until a specific need arises, such as finding a referent, then it may be too late, to select a referent easily or accurately. Thus, reference can also be viewed in terms of what a text makes available for anaphoric reference (cf. Webber, 1978). The picture of pronoun &apos;resolution that emerges from the studies reported here, is one in which effects of distance between the pronoun and its antecedent may play some role, not as a predicator of pronominal reference as has often been thought, but as part of a search strategy. There certainly are cases where nearer antecedents seem to be preferred over ones further back in the text; however, it is more profitable to look to concepts such as foregrounding (cf. Chafe, 1974) rather than simple recency for explanations of the preference. • It is also of same interest to have shown that inferen</context>
