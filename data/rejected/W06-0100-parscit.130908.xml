The Fifth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing will be held in Sydney, Australia, on July
22 – 23, 2006, co-located with COLING/ACL 2006. The annual SIGHAN workshop is an international
forum for presenting the latest research on Chinese language processing. This year, the workshop
attracted 24 submissions to the main session, out of which we accepted 8 as oral paper presentations
and 6 as poster paper presentations.
The Third International Chinese Language Processing Bakeoff was also organized in conjunction with
this workshop. In addition to the Chinese word segmentation task of the first two bakeoffs, this year’s
bakeoff also included the Chinese named entity recognition task. Altogether 29 teams participated in
the bakeoff, organized by Gina-Anne Levow and Olivia Oi Yee Kwong. The increase in the number
of participating teams compared to the last two bakeoffs is testimony to the healthy growth of research
interest in Chinese language processing.
We would like to thank all authors who submitted papers to this workshop, and all program committee
members who worked hard to review the submissions. Special thanks to Gina-Anne Levow who did
a fantastic job organizing a successful bakeoff. We would also like to acknowledge the help of the
following people who provided the corpora used in the bakeoff: Keh-Jiann Chen and Henning Chiu
(Academia Sinica), Mu Li (Microsoft Research Asia), Martha Palmer and Nianwen Xue (University of
Pennsylvania/University of Colorado), Stephanie Strassel (Linguistic Data Consortium), and Benjamin
K. Tsou and Olivia Oi Yee Kwong (City University of Hong Kong). We also thank Benjamin K.
Tsou, Martha Palmer, and Suzanne Stevenson for their guidance and advice in our organization of this
workshop.
We hope that you will have a great time attending this workshop in Sydney!
