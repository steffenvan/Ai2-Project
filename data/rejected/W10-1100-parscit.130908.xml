Welcome to the Second Louhi Workshop on Text and Data Mining of Health Documents, Louhi
2010, in Los Angeles, California, USA. We aim to bring together researchers and practitioners in a
multidisciplinary conference on new uses of computer systems for data mining in the health care area.
The very first Louhi Conference 2008 in Turku, Finland, showed the diversity and complexity of these
issues. The increasing access to clinical data from health care systems and the progress of new methods
and approaches in text and data mining results in a growing attention from the perspective of patient
care as well as biomedical research and education. Improving performance in medical information
retrieval is a challenge of complex nature requiring several approaches. Automatic indexing of clinical
findings, observations, diseases and treatments is of high relevance for clinical work and research in
general. Implementing decision support and guidelines to reach evidence-based practice is a specific
area of interest (Fiszman et al. 2000). Detecting adverse event is another field that needs a high-quality
system to detect findings and events in clinical documents (Griffin and Resar 2009). In several other
areas indexing and mining in clinical text are of utmost importance – from everyday clinical work to
translational biomedical research (Meystre et al. 2008). Health care consumer web sites as well as
news web sites contain important information worthwhile monitoring to extract both information on
specific diseases directed to the layman as well as epidemiological information. The papers presented
in this workshop aim at exploring computational methods and tools to improve and support the work in
these different fields. The Second Louhi workshop will continue to focus and reflect on computer use
in every-day clinical work in hospitals and clinics such as electronic record systems, computer aided
summaries, clinical coding, computerized clinical guidelines, computer decision systems, as well as
related ethical concerns and security. Much of this work concerns itself by necessity with computer
aided language use, and as such Louhi aims at providing an arena for report on development in a
diversity of languages. In the papers presented at Louhi 2010 we can read about many of the challenges
identified above.
A short description of each paper follows in order of appearance. In the first paper, Friberg Heppin
describes the Swedish MedEval corpus, which has been annotated for the needs of both physicians
and patients. The corpus has then been indexed with two different methods for an information retrieval
experiment that aims to satisfy the requirements of both user groups. Bhatia et al. extracted information
from English electronic health records containing diabetes information from a large number of patients,
with the aim to detect populations at high risk of diabetes. Skeppstedt has ported the negation detection
system NegEx, which is written for English clinical text, to Swedish, and describes the porting process
in detail and finally evaluates the Swedish version of NegEx. Schreitter et al. describe a system for
automatic speech recognition of dictated medical records in English. The aim of their work was to
reduce errors in recognizing medication names, trademarks, dosages and strengths, and the authors use
the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) as a knowledge base for the recognition. von Etter et
al. present an approach on monitoring epidemic information from online news articles, with epidemic
intelligence officers as the intended user group. They have defined guidelines based on correctness and
reliability together with the medical users and further annotated 1 000 articles that were then utilized
in a machine learning based classification experiment. The paper by Martin is closely related to the
work by von Etter et al. described above, but focuses on English web pages containing health care
information directed to health care consumers. The author describes an annotation scheme based on
type of information, applied by two students annotating 200 pages of health information documents.
iii
Roque et al. present an overview of five open source visualization tools for electronic health records
for medical practitioners. They describe the tools in the context of users, goals and tasks focusing
on the temporal aspects of the visual presentation. Melton et al. present a system for identifying the
long form of acronyms and abbreviations in biomedical text, using MetaMap applied on the UMLS
to identify the long forms by expanding the acronyms. In Allvin et al. the authors have carried out
both a qualitative and quantitative comparative study of Finnish and Swedish nursing narratives from
two intensive care units. As the Swedish and Finnish languages belong to different language groups,
while the countries are culturally closely related, this study explores how this might influence what is
expressed in the narratives. Halgrim et al. describe a hybrid system for medical extraction based on both
rule based and statistical classifiers. The system is applied on English narrative clinical records from the
i2b2 challenge and uses several rule based processing steps where field detection is one significant step
detecting if a medication occurs in narrative text or in a list of medications. Kokkinakis and Toporowska
Gronostaj have carried out a pilot study to extract events from Swedish medical and clinical text, based
on Frame Semantics and their methodology Swedish FrameNet++ (SFN++). Hirschman and Aberdeen
have developed new metrics for the de-identification and the re-identification problem of clinical text.
They emphasize that traditional information extraction metrics are not enough to address the real-world
questions on ”how good are current de-identification systems?”. Medori and Fairon present a semi-
automatic system for assigning ICD-9-CM codes to discharge summaries in French, and shows that
stemmed and extracted specific encoding information gives better classification results than without
pre-processing. Finally, Lin et al. present ongoing work using Conditional Random Fields to extract
important information from clinical research articles, focusing on extracting formulaic information,
metadata about the authors, longitudinal data and medical intervention methods.
We received in total 16 submissions from eleven countries and three continents, and after a rigorous
double-blind peer-review process we could accept 14 of these submissions to be published in the Louhi
2010 proceedings.
Dear reader, most welcome to study this proceeding, which we hope will raise interest and open new
perspectives in text and data mining of health documents.
