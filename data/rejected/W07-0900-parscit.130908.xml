Museums, archives, and libraries around the world maintain large collections of cultural heritage objects,
such as archaeological artefacts, sound recordings, historical manuscripts, or preserved animal specimens.
Large scale digitisation projects are currently underway to make these collections more accessible. The
natural next step after digitisation is the development of powerful tools to search, link, enrich, and
mine the digitised data. Language technology has an important role to play in this endeavour, even for
collections which are primarily non-textual, since text is the pervasive medium used for metadata. At the
same time, the cultural heritage domain poses special challenges for the NLP community, including the
use of historical or non-standard language and orthography, the presence of OCR or transcription errors
in the input data, and the necessity to deal with data from various media and languages. The cultural
heritage domain is therefore also a challenging and interesting testbed for the robustness of existing
language technology.
The ACL 2007 workshop on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage Data is to be seen in the context
of a growing interest in the development of IT solutions for the cultural heritage domain, as witnessed by
numerous national and international research initiatives, such as CATCH (Continuous Access to Cultural
Heritage), DigiCULT (Digital Culture), MALACH (Multilingual Access to Large Spoken Archives), and
MultiMatch (Multilingual/Multimedia Access To Cultural Heritage).
We solicited papers describing new and original work on all aspects of language technology for the
cultural heritage domain. Out of the 22 submissions received, 11 were selected for inclusion in the
workshop programme following a peer-review process. The list of papers reflects the current breadth
of this exciting and expanding area, with topics covering improved access to cultural heritage data
(combining digital libraries with treebanks, mono- and cross-lingual information retrieval, dealing with
controlled vocabularies), methods for aligning hand-written documents with their transcripts, named
entity recognition for historical texts, knowledge discovery in databases, and museum visitor path
prediction. An invited talk by Douglas W. Oard on the MALACH project completes the workshop
programme.
We would like to thank all authors who submitted papers for the hard work that went into their
submissions. We are also extremely grateful to the members of the programme committee for their
thorough reviews, and to the ACL 2007 organisers, especially the ACL 2007 Workshop Chair Simone
Teufel, for their help with administrative matters. Special thanks to our invited speaker Doug Oard and
to the MultiMatch project for their generous sponsorship of the workshop.
