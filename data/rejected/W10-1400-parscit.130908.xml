The idea of organizing this workshop was sparked following very interesting discussions that occurred
during EACL09 among various researchers working on statistical parsing of different types of
languages. Indeed, an opportunity to discuss the issues that we were all experiencing was much needed,
and it seemed such a good idea that we decided to take advantage of IWPT’09, which was held that year
in Paris, to organize a panel on this topic. We planned to have presentations on the various issues faced
by this small emerging community, which would allow us to share our sometimes similar solutions for
parsing different languages.
Inspired by the idea of organizing such a meeting, but without knowing quite yet if there was any sense
in comparing, for example, Modern Hebrew and French parsing issues, Deirdre Hogan (Dublin City
University) suggested that - should the panel be successful - we ought to organize a real workshop.
She was right. We had an extremely successful and animated panel discussion. We were surprised to
see the extent to which the IWPT’09 audience chose to contribute to the discussion instead of taking a
break from the long presentation sessions. This encouraged us to pursue these attempts at providing a
forum for discussing such matters even further, and to create a new community of shared interests. This
workshop is the result of our common will to do so.
We believe that the issues faced by researchers involved in statistical parsing of morphologically rich
languages are not always well known outside of this small community, and that the kind of challenges
that we all face require a more thorough introduction than we could possibly provide in this foreword.
Therefore, we decided to include here an elaborated preface which presents the current state-of-affairs
with respect to parsing MRLs and frames the various contributions to our workshop in relation to it.
The overview should act as a primer for those who are not experienced in the subject and yet wish
to participate in the discussion. All in all, we are proud to have 11 very nice papers presented in our
proceedings that will help advance the state of the art in parsing MRLs. In order to obtain sufficient
presentation slots, we asked our authors to choose between different modes of presentation, we are glad
the authors involved in 3 papers accepted to present them as posters.
Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to the many people who encouraged us on this journey:
Harry Bunt, Alon Lavie and Kenji Sagae from SIGPARSE which fully endorses this project; Joakim
Nivre who heartily encouraged us to launch our workshop, Eric de la Clergerie who agreed to give us a
slot at IWPT’09 and Josef van Genabith who very kindly chaired our first panel, all of whom constantly
advised us during this year - this was precious to us. More than 20 very busy researchers agreed to
review for our workshop - without their commitment this would have been plainly impossible. We
further wish to thank Kevin Knight who kindly agreed to give a talk on a pressing topic, morphology
in SMT, in this workshop, and Dan Bikel, Julia Hockenmaier, Slav Petrov and Owen Rambow, who
willingly agreed to engage in our panel discussion. Last but not least, we want to thank Laurence
Danlos - whose team, the Alpage project, is funding our workshop - for believing in our project from
the start.
Best regards,
The SPRML2010 extended Program Committee
