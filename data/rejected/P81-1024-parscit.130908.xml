Model-theoretic pragmatics is an attempt to provide a
formal description of the pragmatics of natural language
as effects arising from using model-theoretic semantics
in a dynamic environment. The pragmatic phenomena
considered here have been variously labeled
presuprosition [1] and conventional implicaturc [6].
The models used in traditional model-theoretic semantics
provide a complete and static representation of knowledge
about the world. However, this is not the environment
in which language is used. Language is used in a
dynamic environment - the participants have incomplete
knowledge of the world and the understanding of a
sentence can add to the knowledge of the listener. A
formalism which allows models to contain incomplete
knowledge and to which knowledge can be added has been
developed [2, 3, 12].
In model-theoretic semantics, the relationships between
words is not inherent in the structure of the model.
These relationships between words are given by logical
formulas, called meaning postulates. In traditional
model-theoretic semantics (with static models), these
meaning postulates can be evaluated when the model is
chosen to insure that it is a reasonable model for the
language. In dynamic model-theoretic semantics, these
relationships must be verified as information is added
to the model to insure that the new information does not
violate any of these relationships. This verification
process may cause the addition of more information to
the model.
The processing of the formula representing a sentence
adds to the dynamic model the information given as the
assertion of the sentence - the primary information of
the sentence - if it is not already in the model. The
addition of this primary information can cause - through
the verification of a meaning postulate - the addition
of secondary information. This secondary information
is not part of the assertion of the sentence, but is
needed in the processing of the assertion. This
characterization of secondary information is very similar
to the classical definition of presupposition [1].
This approach displays different behavior for the three
different cases of information contained in the model.
In the first case, neither the assertion nor the pre-
suppositions and implicatures are known. The attempt
to add the assertion activates the verification of the
meaning postulates giving the presuppositions and
implicatures, thus causing that secondary information to
be added to the model as a prerequisite to the addition
of the primary information. In the second case, the
presuppositions and implicatures are known (either true
or false) and the assertion is unknown. The attempt to
add the primary information again activates the
verification of the meaning postulates. However, in
this case, the presuppositions and implicatures are
simply being checked - the verification process, is not
interrupted to add this secondary information to the
model. This case corresponds to what Grice and others
have termed to be a well-structured conversation. In
the third case, the assertion of the sentence is known
to be true or false. Since no new information needs to
be added to the model to process the semantic represen-
tation of the sentence, the verification of meaning
postulates is not activated. The presuppositions and
implicatures need not be verified because they had to
have been verified before the assertion of the sentence
or its negation could have been entered into the model.
The presuppositions and implicatures of subordinate
clauses do not necessarily become presuppositions and
implicatures of the whole sentence. The problem of
when and how such presuppositions become those of the
matrix sentence is known as the projection problem [13].
The system described here provides a simple and motivated
solution to the projection problem. The models used in
this system are partial models; a clause which has a
presupposition or implicature which is not true has an
undefinable denotation. An intensional logic [11] is
used to provide the semantic representations of sentences
and the intensionality establishes transparent and opaque
contexts (holes and plugs [7]) which determine whether or
not an undefinable value indicating the failure of a
presupposition for a subordinate clause can propagate
and force the matrix sentence to have an undefinable
value. In the case where the presuppositions and
implicatures are projected up from the subordinate clause
to the matrix sentence, undefinable values are allowed to
propagate, and thus a failure of a projected pre-
supposition or implicature affects not only the sub-
ordinate clause in which it originates, but also the
matrix sentence.
The determination of the projection characteristics is
claimed to be an integral part of the meanings of words
and not a separable feature.
There are two other major attempts to handle pre-
suppositions and implicatures in a model-theoretic
framework. Karttunen and Peters [8, 9, 10] produce a
formula giving the conventional implicatures of a
sentence from its syntactic structure. Gazdar [4, 5]
accumulates sets of propositions, cancelling out those
which are incompatible. Moran [12] compares the
approach taken here to that of Karttunen and Peters and
shows how this approach is simpler and better motivated.
Gazdar&apos;s system is broader, but this approach is shown
to correctly handle sentences which are incorrectly
handled by Gazdar, and ways are suggested to expand the
coverage of this system.
