<bodyText confidence="0.99985696">
In the recent years, we have seen rapid adoption of dialog systems in commercial
applications. They range from telephone-based services, in-car interactive systems, to
online conversational service agents and talking characters in computer games. Open-
standard platforms such as VoiceXML have been adopted by the industry, and become
the driving force for the faster adoption of dialog applications.
The widespread dialog applications in industry setting pose challenge for researchers in
both industrial and academic worlds. Progress from academic world has not benefited the
real world applications to a satisfactory extent. The purpose of this one-day workshop is
to provide a forum to bring industrial and academic researchers together to share their
experiences and visions in the dialog technology development, and to identify topics that
are of interest to both camps.
There are total 13 papers accepted for presentation at this workshop, with 8 papers for
long presentation and 5 for short presentation. These papers are almost evenly divided
between the industry and academic communities. In addition, two panels on the related
dialog topics have been arranged during the workshop, with distinguished panelists of
various backgrounds from academic, industrial, and standardization communities.
We are pleased to the see some real convergence from both industry and academic side.
While academic researchers are proposing and building practical dialog systems,
industrial researchers are starting to implement sophisticated learning and uncertainty
modeling into their system. The scope of this workshop papers ranges from advanced
dialog systems for technical support, multi-modal methods, to POMDP modeling,
reinforcement learning and adaptable dialog architecture.
Finally, we would like to thank our program committee members for their work, and
thank the NAACL-HLT conference organizers for their timely support. Together, we
hope to foster and advance the state of art of dialog technologies.
