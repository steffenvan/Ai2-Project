This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the ACL 2007 Workshop on Cognitive
Aspects of Computational Language Acquisition, held in Prague, Czech Republic on the 29th of June,
2007.
The past decades have seen a massive expansion in the application of statistical and machine learning
methods to natural language processing (NLP). This work has yielded impressive results in numerous
speech and language processing tasks including speech recognition, morphological analysis, parsing,
lexical acquisition, semantic interpretation, and dialogue management.
Advances in these areas are generally viewed as engineering achievements but recently researchers have
begun to investigate the relevance of computational learning techniques to research on human language
acquisition. These investigations could have double significance since an improved understanding of
human language acquisition will not only benefit cognitive sciences in general but may also feed back
to the NLP community, placing researchers in a better position to develop new language models and/or
techniques.
Success in this type of research requires close collaboration between NLP and cognitive scientists. The
aim of this workshop is thus to bring together researchers from the diverse fields of NLP, machine
learning, artificial intelligence, linguistics, psycho-linguistics, etc. who are interested in the relevance
of computational techniques for understanding human language learning. The workshop is intended to
bridge the gap between the computational and cognitive communities, promote knowledge and resource
sharing, and help initiate interdisciplinary research projects.
In the call for papers we solicited papers describing cognitive aspects of computational language
acquisition including:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999445333333333">
• Computational learning theory and analysis of language learning
• Computational models of human (first, second and bilingual) language acquisition
• Computational models of various components of the language faculty and their impact on the
acquisition task
• Computational models of the evolution of language
• Data resources and tools for investigating computational models of human language acquisition
• Empirical and theoretical comparisons of the learning environment and its impact on the
acquisition task
• Computational methods for acquiring various linguistic information (related to e.g. speech,
morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, and discourse) and their relevance to research on human
language acquisition
• Investigations and comparisons of supervised, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.947441357142857">
for learning (e.g. machine learning, statistical, symbolic, biologically-inspired, active learning,
various hybrid models) from the cognitive aspect
Of the 22 papers submitted, the programme committee selected 12 papers for publication that are
representative of the state-of-the-art in this interdisciplinary area. Each full-length submission was
independently reviewed by three members of the program committee, who then collectively faced
the difficult task of selecting a subset of papers for publication from a very strong field. Among the
accepted papers we see proposed techniques for creating, analysing and annotating data resources for
research on language acquisition. We also see presentations of computational models for first and
second language acquisition. These models investigate the acquisition of both syntactic and semantic
phenomena, adopting different linguistic theories and formalisms, using varying levels of supervision.
We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers, as well as the members of the programme
committee for the time and effort they contributed in reviewing the papers. Our thanks go also to
the organisers of the main conference, the publication chairs, and the conference workshop committee
headed by Simone Teufel.
