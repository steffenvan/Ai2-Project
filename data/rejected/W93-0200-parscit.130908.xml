Preface

<bodyText confidence="0.999558">
Generating multi-sentential text requires the ability to compose individual clauses into larger units,
a process called text planning. Clearly, text planning is an important component of our linguistic
competence: we do not always communicate by single, isolated, clause-sized utterances. Two ap-
proaches to this question in the field of text generation have proved seminal: McKeown&apos;s 1982 thesis,
in which she uses rhetorical schemata to represent typical domain-independent text structures, and
the text planners under development at ISI since 1988 under the direction of Ed Hovy, which use
plan operators based on Mann and Thompson&apos;s Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) in a STRI PS-
like planning architecture. What these two approaches have in common is the term &amp;quot;rhetorical-
and the claim that they are domain-independent architectures. While they have spawned a large
number of approaches, architectures, systems, and theories, there has been a general undercurrent
of dissatisfaction with things &amp;quot;rhetorical&amp;quot;; for example, various discourse phenomena have teen
identified in the literature that specific theories (usually, RST) cannot handle, or cannot handle el-
egantly. Furthermore, researchers in discourse analysis (as opposed to text generation) have by and
large ignored rhetorical approaches, or brushed them off as insignificant, often arguing that rhetor-
ical relations are an epiphenomenon of deeper relations between communicative intentions. This
widespread use of, and simultaneous dislike of, rhetorical relations has motivated this workshop. If
a theory of rhetorical relations is useful (or required?) for text planning, then it. must contain some
useful insight. If such theories are disliked, then present theories of rhetorical relations (such as
RST) need to be improved, or perhaps completely reworked. In order to approach these tasks. a
clearer understanding of the underlying theoretical issues is required. The goal of the worksho is
bring together researchers from different fields, including discourse understanding, discourse gener•
ation, and linguistic discourse analysis, and to discuss the relationship between discourse relatioils,
intentions, and the representation of the discourse participants&apos; beliefs, desires, and intentions. The
hope is that a lively discussion will help identify useful insights that should be retained, and aviims
errors that should be avoided, in future theories of discourse structure.
I would like to thank the members of the organizing committee, Judy Delin, Ed Rovy, and Johal111:1

Pennsylvania, for logistical support; Terry Patten, for local organization help; and Don Walker, I.
