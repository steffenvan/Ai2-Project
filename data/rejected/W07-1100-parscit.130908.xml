This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the workshop A Broader Perspective on
Multiword Expressions. The workshop is endorsed by the Association for Computational Linguistics
Special Interest Group on the Lexicon (SIGLEX) and is held in conjunction with the ACL 2007
Conference on June 28th, 2007 in Prague, Czech Republic.
In recent years, the NLP community has increasingly become aware of the problems that multiword
expressions (MWEs) pose. A considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area, some
within large research projects dedicated to MWEs. Although progress has been made especially in the
area of multiword extraction, a number of fundamental questions remain unanswered. The goal of the
workshop is to address some of these questions with oral and poster presentations, as well as general
discussion period at the end of the workshop. In particular, we want to focus on the following topics:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99960325">
• Is it sufficient to use purely statistical methods for the extraction of MWEs from corpora, or is it
necessary to harness human knowledge and linguistic insights?
• To what extent can definitions and extraction procedures be generalised to other languages, other
text types and other types of MWEs?
• What properties should be specified for MWEs or subtypes of MWEs in the lexicon? And can we
detect these properties automatically with sufficient accuracy?
• What role do the semantics of MWEs play in NLP applications and can they be determined
automatically from large corpora?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965846153846">
We received 23 submissions in total. Each submission was reviewed by at least two members of the
program committee, who did not only give an overall verdict but also provided detailed comments to the
authors. Due to the large number of interesting papers we had received and the fact that the workshop is
only half-day, we decided on an unusual format including a poster session slot. This allowed us to accept
ten papers for presentation at the workshop, four oral and six poster presentations. The poster session
offers an opportunity to exhibit a wider range of approaches and points of view than would otherwise
have been possible, and we hope it will thus initiate a lively and fruitful discussion period at the end of
the workshop.
We would like to thank all the authors for submitting their research and the members of the program
committee for their careful reviews and useful suggestions to the authors. We would also like to thank
the ACL 2007 organising committee that made this workshop possible and SIGLEX for its endorsement.
Finally, we hope that this workshop will provide plentiful and tasty food for thought to all participants as
well as readers of its proceedings.
