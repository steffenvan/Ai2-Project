This volume contains the papers accepted for presentation at the Third ACL-SIGSEM Workshop
on Prepositions, hosted in conjunction with the 11th Conference of the European Chapter of the
Association for Computational Linguistics on April 3rd, 2006, in Trento, Italy.
This meeting is supported by the ACL Special Interest Group on Semantics (SIGSEM, http://mcs.
open.ac.uk/pp2464/sigsem/), which aims to promote research in all aspects of computational
semantics. Two successful workshops endorsed by ACL-SIGSEM devoted to the topic of prepositions
were held in Toulouse, France in September 2003, and Colchester, UK in April 2005.
Prepositions have received a considerable amount of attention in recent years, due to their importance
in computational tasks. For instance, in NLP, PP attachment ambiguities have attracted a lot of
attention, and different machine learning techniques have been employed with varying degrees of
success. Researchers from various perspectives have also looked at spatial or temporal aspects of
prepositions, and their cross-linguistic differences, monolingual and cross-linguistic contrasts or the
role of prepositions in syntactic alternations. Moreover, in languages like English and German, phrasal
verbs have also been the subject of considerable effort, ranging from techniques for their automatic
extraction from corpora, to methods for the determination of their semantics. In other languages, like
Romance languages or Hindi, the focus has been either on the incorporation of the preposition or its
inclusion in the prepositional phrase. All these configurations are of much interest semantically as well
as syntactically.
In the call for papers we solicited papers working on aspects of prepositions, such as:
Descriptions: prepositions in lexical resources (WordNet, FrameNet), productive versus collocation
uses, multilingual descriptions (mismatches, incorporation, divergences), prepositions and
thematic roles.
Applications: dealing with prepositions in applications e.g. for machine translation, information
extraction or natural language generation.
Representation of prepositions: prepositions in knowledge bases, cognitive or logic-based
formalisms for the description of the semantics of prepositions (in isolation, and in
composition/confrontation with the verb and the NP), compositional semantics; implications for
AI and KR.
Prepositions in reasoning procedures: how different kinds of preposition provide distinct challenges
to a reasoning system and how they can be handled.
Cognitive dimensions of prepositions: how different kinds of prepositions are
acquired/interpreted/represented, in terms of human and/or computational processing.
Of the 17 papers submitted, the program committee selected 13 papers for presentation at the workshop
and inclusion in these proceedings, representative of the state of the art in this subject today. Each
full-length submission was peer-reviewed by three members of the international program committee,
whose job was made difficult by the high quality level of submissions. The accepted papers include
proposals for the extraction of prepositional phrases from corpora, creation of a preposition ontology,
disambiguation of verb particle sequences, translation of prepositions, interpretation of prepositions for
iii
practical applications, such as question answering systems, quantitative analyses of prepositions and
prepositional phrases, as well as analyses within formal grammatical frameworks such as HPSG, LFG
and OT. The papers deal not only with English, but also with languages such as German, Swedish,
Polish, Finnish and Bengali.
We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers, the members of the program committee
for the time and effort they expended in reviewing the papers, and the panelists for supporting and
stimulating this event. Our thanks go also to the executive committee of the ACL-SIGSEM sub-group
on prepositions, the organizers of the main conference and Maarten de Rijke and Caroline Sporleder,
the EACL 2006 workshop chairs.
