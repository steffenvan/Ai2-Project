Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969258064516">
Whenever we read a book, write a letter or launch a query on a search engine, we always use words, the
shorthand labels and concrete forms of abstract notions (concepts, ideas and more or less well specified
thoughts). Yet, words are not only vehicles to express thoughts, they are also means to conceive them.
They are mediators between language and thought, allowing us to move quickly from one idea to
another, refining, expanding or illustrating our possibly underspecified thoughts. Only words have
these unique capabilities, which is why they are so important.
Obviously, a good dictionary should contain many entries and a lot of information associated with each
one of them. Yet, the quality of a dictionary depends not only on coverage, but also on accessibility
of information. Access strategies vary with the task (text understanding vs. text production) and the
knowledge available at the moment of consultation (words, concepts, speech sounds). Unlike readers
who look for meanings, writers start from them, searching for the corresponding words. While paper
dictionaries are static, permitting only limited strategies for accessing information, their electronic
counterparts promise dynamic, proactive search via multiple criteria (meaning, sound, related words)
and via diverse access routes. Navigation takes place in a huge conceptual lexical space, and the results
are displayable in a multitude of forms (e.g. as trees, as lists, as graphs, or sorted alphabetically, by
topic, by frequency).
Many lexicographers work nowadays with huge digital corpora, using language technology to build
and to maintain the lexicon. But access to the potential wealth of information in dictionaries remains
limited for the common user. Yet, the new possibilities of electronic media in terms of comfort, speed
and flexibility (multiple inputs, polyform outputs) are enormous. Computational resources are not prone
to the same limitations as paperbound dictionaries. The latter were limited in scope, being confined to
a specific task (translation, synonyms, ...) for economical reasons, but this limitation is not justified
anymore.
Today, by exploiting the advantages of the digital form, we can perform all tasks via one single resource,
which may comprise a dictionary, a thesaurus and even more. The goal of this second CogALex
workshop, which follows the first edition at COLING 2008 in Manchester, is to perform the groundwork
for the next generation of electronic dictionaries, that is, to study the possibility of integrating the
different resources, as well as to explore the feasibility of taking the users needs, knowledge and access
strategies into account. To reach this goal, we have invited researchers from fields such as computational
lexicography, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, language learning and ergonomics to address
one or several of the following topics:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998489125">
1. Conceptual input of a dictionary user. What is in the authors’ minds when they are generating a
message and looking for a word? Do they start from partial definitions, i.e. underspecified input
(bag of words), conceptual primitives, semantically related words, something akin to synsets,
or something completely different? What does it take to bridge the gap between this input,
incomplete as it may be, and the desired output (target word)?
2. Organizing the lexicon and indexing words. Concepts, words and multi-word expressions can be
organized and indexed in many ways, depending on the task and language type. For example,
in Indo-European languages words are traditionally organized in alphabetical order, whereas in
</listItem>

Chinese they are organized by semantic radicals and stroke counts. The way words and multi-
word expressions are stored and organized affects indexing and access. Since knowledge states
(i.e. knowledge available when initiating search) vary greatly and in unpredictable ways, indexing
must allow for multiple ways of navigation and access. Hence the question: what organizational
principles allow the greatest flexibility for access?
3. Access, navigation and search strategies based on various entry types (modalities) and knowledge
states. Words are composed of meanings, forms and sounds. Hence, access should be possible
via any of these components: via meanings (bag of words), via forms, simple or compound (’hot,
dog’ vs. ’hot-dog’), and via sounds (syllables). Access should be possible even if input is given
in an incomplete, imprecise or degraded form. Furthermore, to allow for natural and efficient
access, we need to take the users’ knowledge into account (search space reduction) and provide
adequate navigational tools, metaphorically speaking, a map and a compass. How do existing
tools address these needs, and what could be done to go further?
4. NLP applications: Contributors can also demonstrate how such enhanced dictionaries, once
embedded in existing NLP applications, can boost performance and help to solve lexical
and textual-entailment problems, such as those evaluated in SEMEVAL 2007, or, more
generally, generation problems encountered in the context of summarization, question-answering,
interactive paraphrasing or translation.
Quite a few of these issues are dealt with in the papers we received. The accepted papers present
a rich selection of ideas on the crossroads of semantics, cognition, lexicography, and language
learning, thereby emphasizing the interdisciplinary character of the workshop. These are the topics:
generating semantic networks, encoding commonsense knowledge in WordNet, textual entailment,
sentiment analysis, corpus-based extraction of conceptual classes, parsing of thesauri, term extraction,
determining noun classifiers, requirements when using the dictionary of an authoring tool, and the
problem of word access.
In sum, there is an active community of researchers working on cognitive aspects of the lexicon, and
there is a real awareness concerning the importance of the problems presented in our call for papers.
We would like to thank all the people who in one way or another have helped us to make this workshop a
success. Our special thanks go to Eduard Hovy for having accepted to give the invited presentation, and
to the members of the program committee who did an excellent job in reviewing the submitted papers.
Their reviews were important not only to assure a good selection of papers, but also for the authors,
helping them to improve their work. We would also like to express our gratitude to the COLING
organizers, in particular to the general workshop chairs and the publication chairs. Last but not least, we
would like to thank our authors for their papers and presentations and the participants of the workshop
for their interest and their contributions to the discussions.
