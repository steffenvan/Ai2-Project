Introduction to Computational Linguistics
Ralph Grishman, New York University
This tutorial provides a general overview of computational
linguistics. Topics to be considered include the components
of a natural language processing system; syntax analysis
(including context-free grammars, augmented context-free
grammars, grammatical constraints, and sources of syntactic
ambiguity); semantic analysis (including meaning represen-
tation, semantic constraints, quantifier analysis); and dis-
course analysis (identifying implicit information, establishing
text coherence, frames, and scripts). Examples will be drawn
from various application areas, including database interface
and text analysis.

Natural Language Generation
Kathleen McKeown, Columbia University

<bodyText confidence="0.999979">
In this tutorial, we will begin by identifying the types of deci-
sions involved in language generation and how they differ
From problems in the interpretation of natural language.
Several techniques that have been used for &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; genera-
tion (i.e., determining the syntactic structure and vocabulary
of the generated text) will be examined, including grammars,
dictionaries, and templates. From there, we will move on to
other problems in language generation; including how the
system can decide what to say in a given situation and how
it can order the information for inclusion in a text. Here we
will study the constraints that have been used for these deci-
sions in domains such as expert systems, database systems,
scene description, and problem solving. We will also look at
the interaction between conceptual decisions such as these
and decisions in surface generation, considering approaches
that propose an integrated solution.

Structuring the Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99537825">
Robert Ingria, BBN Laboratories Incorporated
This tutorial will discuss the information that has been
stored in the lexicon. It will first deal with the types of in-
formation that have typically been placed in lexical entries,
detailing what sorts of lexical information is necessary for
natural language systems. The format of lexical entries and
the relationships between lexical entries will be considered
next (as in cases of irregularly inflected forms, such &amp;quot;go&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;went&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;gone&amp;quot;, abbreviations and acronyms, such as &amp;quot;helo&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;helicopter&amp;quot;, and derived forms, such as &amp;quot;destroy&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;destruction&amp;quot;). Alternate places for storing information will
also be considered (for example, regular morphological infor-
mation might be contained in individual lexical entries or in
the grammar). The tutorial will conclude with the implica-
tions of recent work in linguistic theory for the structure of
lexicons for computational purposes.

Recent Developments In Syntactic Theory and Their
Computational Import
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977973533333333">
Anthony S. Kroch, University of Pennsylvania
Syntactic frameworks currently under development in linguis-
tics take different perspectives on several issues of computa-
tional interest. Among these are: (1) the importance of stat-
ing linguistic theories in a well-defined and explicit formalism
whose mathematical properties are known or investigable; (2)
the degree to which the syntatic properties of sentences can
be understood independently of their semantic interpretation;
and (3) the extent to which empirical and mathematical
results on parsing and generation can illuminate linguistic
issues. We shall discuss the perspectives on these and related
questions held by various current linguistic theories, including
generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG), government
binding theory (GB), lexical-functional grammar (LFG), and
tree adjoining grammar (TAG).
Current Approaches to Natural Language Semantics
Graeme Hirst, University of Toronto
This tutorial provides a survey of various computational ap-
proaches to semantics--the process of determining the mean-
ing of a sentence or other utterance. Issues addressed will
include definitions of meaning; the differences between lin-
guistic theories of semantics and formalisms suitable for com-
putational understanding of language; knowledge represen-
tations that suitable for representing linguistic meaning; the
relationship between semantic processing and syntactic pars-
ing; and factors in choosing a semantic formalism for a par-
ticular computational application. The approaches to seman-
tics that will be discussed will include procedural semantics,
conceptual dependency, Montague semantics, and composi-
tional and knowledge-based approaches.

Machine Translation

<bodyText confidence="0.952653222222222">
Sergei Nirenburg, Colgate University
This tutorial will address the recent resurgence of interest in
machine translation (MT) in the United States, Europe, and
Japan. Topics to be discussed include the variety of objec-
tives for MT systems; various research and developments
methodologies; MT as an application area for theoretical lin-
guistics, computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence;
environments for MT research; and selected case studies of
research projects.
