It is generally recognized that the common non-
terminal labels for syntactic constituents (NP,
VP, etc.) do not exhaust the syntactic and se-
mantic information one would like about parts
of a syntactic tree. For example, the Penn Tree-
bank gives each constituent zero or more &apos;func-
tion tags&apos; indicating semantic roles and other
related information not easily encapsulated in
the simple constituent labels. We present a sta-
tistical algorithm for assigning these function
tags that, on text already parsed to a simple-
label level, achieves an F-measure of 87%, which
rises to 99% when considering &apos;no tag&apos; as a valid
choice.

<bodyText confidence="0.9996224">
Parsing sentences using statistical information
gathered from a treebank was first examined a
decade ago in (ChitraD and Grishman, 1990)
and is by now a fairly well-studied problem
((Charniak, 1997), (Collins, 1997), (Ratna-
parkhi, 1997)). But to date, the end product of
the parsing process has for the most part been
a bracketing with simple constituent labels like
NP, VP, or SBAR. The Penn treebank contains a
great deal of additional syntactic and seman-
tic information from which to gather statistics;
reproducing more of this information automat-
ically is a goal which has so far been mostly
ignored. This paper details a process by which
some of this information—the function tags—
may be recovered automatically.
In the Penn treebank, there are 20 tags (fig-
ure 1) that can be appended to constituent la-
bels in order to indicate additional information
about the syntactic or semantic role of the con-

stituent. We have divided them into four cate-
gories (given in figure 2) based on those in the
bracketing guidelines (Bies et al., 1995). A con-
stituent can be tagged with multiple tags, but
never with two tags from the same category.1
In actuality, the case where a constituent has
tags from all four categories never happens, but
constituents with three tags do occur (rarely).
At a high level, we can simply say that hav-
ing the function tag information for a given text
is useful just because any further information
would help. But specifically, there are distinct
advantages for each of the various categories.
Grammatical tags are useful for any application
trying to follow the thread of the text—they find
the &apos;who does what&apos; of each clause, which can
be useful to gain information about the situa-
tion or to learn more about the behaviour of
the words in the sentence. The form/function
tags help to find those constituents behaving in
ways not conforming to their labelled type, as
well as further clarifying the behaviour of ad-
verbial phrases. Information retrieval applica-
tions specialising in describing events, as with a
number of the MUC applications, could greatly
benefit from some of these in determining the
where-when-why of things. Noting a topicalised
constituent could also prove useful to these ap-
plications, and it might also help in discourse
analysis, or pronoun resolution. Finally, the
&apos;miscellaneous&apos; tags are convenient at various
times; particularly the CLR &apos;closely related&apos; tag,
which among other things marks phrasal verbs
and prepositional ditransitives.
To our knowledge, there has been no attempt
so far to recover the function tags in pars-
ing treebank text. In fact, we know of only

2 Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991515">
We have found it useful to define our statisti-
cal model in terms of features. A &apos;feature&apos;, in
this context, is a boolean-valued function, gen-
erally over parse tree nodes and either node la-
bels or lexical items. Features can be fairly sim-
ple and easily read off the tree (e.g. &apos;this node&apos;s
label is X&apos;, &apos;this node&apos;s parent&apos;s label is Y&apos;), or
slightly more complex (`this node&apos;s head&apos;s part-
of-speech is Z&apos;). This is concordant with the us-
age in the maximum entropy literature (Berger
et al., 1996).
When using a number of known features to
guess an unknown one, the usual procedure is
to calculate the value of each feature, and then
essentially look up the empirically most proba-
ble value for the feature to be guessed based on
those known values. Due to sparse data, some
of the features later in the list may need to be
ignored; thus the probability of an unknown fea-
ture value would be estimated as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9998895">
P /2, • • • , f.)
P(f f2, • • • , n, (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999678">
where P refers to an empirically observed prob-
ability. Of course, if features 1 through i only
co-occur a few times in the training, this value
may not be reliable, so the empirical probability
is usually smoothed:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996622">
P(f I f 2, • • • , fi)

+ (1 - /2, • • • , fi-i) • (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999265461538461">
The values for Ai can then be determined ac-
cording to the number of occurrences of features
1 through i together in the training.
One way to think about equation 1 (and
specifically, the notion that j will depend on
the values of Ii fn) is as follows: We begin
with the prior probability of f. If we have data
indicating P(fIfi), we multiply in that likeli-
hood, while dividing out the original prior. If
we have data for P( fl f2), we multiply that
in while dividing out the P (f in) term. This is
repeated for each piece of feature data we have;
at each point, we are adjusting the probability

we already have estimated. If knowledge about
feature fi makes f more likely than with just
fi_i, the term where fi is added will be
greater than one and the running probability
will be adjusted upward. This gives us the new
probability shown in equation 3, which is ex-
actly equivalent to equation 1 since everything
except the last numerator cancels out of the
equation. The value of j is chosen such that
features Ii fi are sufficiently represented in
the training data; sometimes all n features are
used, but often that would cause sparse data
problems. Smoothing is performed on this equa-
tion exactly as before: each term is interpolated
between the empirical value and the prior esti-
mated probability, according to a value of Ai
that estimates confidence. But aside from per-
haps providing a new way to think about the
problem, equation 3 is not particularly useful
as it is—it is exactly the same as what we had
before. Its real usefulness comes, as shown in
(Charniak, 1999), when we move from the no-
tion of a feature chain to a feature tree.
These feature chains don&apos;t capture everything
we&apos;d like them to. If there are two independent
features that are each relatively sparse but occa-
sionally carry a lot of information, then putting
one before the other in a chain will effectively
block the second from having any effect, since
its information is (uselessly) conditioned on the
first one, whose sparseness will completely di-
lute any gain. What we&apos;d really like is to be able
to have a feature tree, whereby we can condition
those two sparse features independently on one
common predecessor feature. As we said be-
fore, equation 3 represents, for each feature
the probability of f based on fi and all its pre-
decessors, divided by the probability of f based
only on the predecessors. In the chain case, this
means that the denominator is conditioned on
every feature from 1 to i — 1, but if we use a
feature tree, it is conditioned only on those fea-
tures along the path to the root of the tree.
A notable issue with feature trees as opposed
to feature chains is that the terms do not all
cancel out. Every leaf on the tree will be repre-

sented in the numerator, and every fork in the
tree (from which multiple nodes depend) will
be represented at least once in the denomina-
tor. For example: in figure 3 we have a small
feature tree that has one target feature and four
conditioning features. Features b and d are in-
dependent of each other, but each depends on a;
c depends directly only on b. The unsmoothed
version of the corresponding equation would be

<bodyText confidence="0.7895945">
which, after cancelling of terms and smoothing,
results in

Note that strictly speaking the result is not a
probability distribution. It could be made into
one with an appropriate normalisation—the
so-called partition function in the maximum-
entropy literature. However, if the indepen-
dence assumptions made in the derivation of
equation 4 are good ones, the partition func-
tion will be close to 1.0. We assume this to be
the case for our feature trees.
Now we return the discussion to function tag-
ging. There are a number of features that seem

to condition strongly for one function tag or an-
other; we have assembled them into the feature
tree shown in figure 4.2 This figure should be
relatively self-explanatory, except for the notion
of an &apos;alternate head&apos;; currently, an alternate
head is only defined for prepositional phrases,
and is the head of the object of the preposi-
tional phrase. This data is very important in
distinguishing, for example, &apos;by John&apos; (where
John might be a logical subject) from &apos;by next
year&apos; (a temporal modifier) and &apos;by selling it&apos;
(an adverbial indicating manner).

3 Experiment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97058484">
In the training phase of our experiment, we
gathered statistics on the occurrence of func-
tion tags in sections 2-21 of the Penn treebank.
Specifically, for every constituent in the tree-
bank, we recorded the presence of its function
tags (or lack thereof) along with its condition-
ing information. From this we calculated the
empirical probabilities of each function tag ref-
erenced in section 2 of this paper. Values of A
were determined using EM on the development
corpus (treebank section 24).
To test, then, we simply took the output of
our parser on the test corpus (treebank section
23), and applied a postprocessing step to add
function tags. For each constituent in the tree,
we calculated the likelihood of each function tag
according to the feature tree in figure 4, and
for each category (see figure 2) we assigned the
most likely function tag (which might be the
null tag).
2The reader will note that the &apos;features&apos; listed in the
tree are in fact not boolean-valued; each node in the
given tree can be assumed to stand for a chain of boolean
features, one per potential value at that node, exactly
one of which will be true.

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979457142857">
To evaluate our results, we first need to deter-
mine what is &apos;correct&apos;. The definition we chose
is to call a constituent correct if there exists in
the correct parse a constituent with the same
start and end points, label, and function tag
(or lack thereof). Since we treated each of the
four function tag categories as a separate fea-
ture for the purpose of tagging, evaluation was
also done on a per-category basis.
The denominator of the accuracy measure
should be the maximum possible number we
could get correct. In this case, that means
excluding those constituents that were already
wrong in the parser output; the parser we used
attains 89% labelled precision-recall, so roughly
11% of the constituents are excluded from the
function tag accuracy evaluation. (For refer-
ence, we have also included the performance of
our function tagger directly on treebank parses;
the slight gain that resulted is discussed below.)
Another consideration is whether to count
non-tagged constituents in our evaluation. On
the one hand, we could count as correct any
constituent with the correct tag as well as any
correctly non-tagged constituent, and use as
our denominator the number of all correctly-
labelled constituents. (We will henceforth refer
to this as the &apos;with-null&apos; measure.) On the other
hand, we could just count constituents with the
correct tag, and use as our denominators the
total number of tagged, correctly-labelled con-
stituents. We believe the latter number (`no-
null&apos;) to be a better performance metric, as it
is not overwhelmed by the large number of un-
tagged constituents. Both are reported below.

5 Results

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.968741">
5.1 Baselines
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996280875">
There are, it seems, two reasonable baselines
for this and future work. First of all, most con-
stituents in the corpus have no tags at all, so
obviously one baseline is to simply guess no tag
for any constituent. Even for the most com-
mon type of function tag (grammatical), this
method performs with 87% accuracy. Thus the
with-null accuracy of a function tagger needs to
be very high to be significant here.
The second baseline might be useful in ex-
amining the no-null accuracy values (particu-
larly the recall): always guess the most common
tag in a category. This means that every con-
stituent gets labelled with `--SBJ-TMP-TPC-CLR&apos;
(meaning that it is a topicalised temporal sub-
ject that is &apos;closely related&apos; to its verb). This
combination of tags is in fact entirely illegal
by the treebank guidelines, but performs ad-
equately for a baseline. The precision is, of
course, abysmal, for the same reasons the first
baseline did so well; but the recall is (as one
might expect) substantial. The performances
of the two baseline measures are given in Table
1.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.972453">
5.2 Performance in individual
categories
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994772727273">
In table 2, we give the results for each category.
The first column is the with-null accuracy, and
the precision and recall values given are the no-
null accuracy, as noted in section 4.
Grammatical tagging performs the best of the
four categories. Even using the more difficult
no-null accuracy measure, it has a 96% accu-
racy. This seems to reflect the fact that gram-
matical relations can often be guessed based on
constituent labels, parts of speech, and high-
frequency lexical items, largely avoiding sparse-
data problems. Topicalisation can similarly be
guessed largely on high-frequency information,
and performed almost as well (93%).
On the other hand, we have the
form/function tags and the &apos;miscellaneous&apos;
tags. These are characterised by much more
semantic information, and the relationships
between lexical items are very important,
making sparse data a real problem. All the
same, it should be noted that the performance
is still far better than the baselines.

deed, we tried a number of different trees on the
development corpus; this tree gave among the
best overall results, with no category perform-
ing too badly. However, there is no reason to
use only one feature tree for all four categories;
the best results can be got by using a separate
tree for each one. One can thus achieve slight
(one to three point) gains in each category.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999483">
5.4 Overall performance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999893878787879">
The overall performance, given in table 3, ap-
pears promising. With a tagging accuracy of
about 87%, various information retrieval and
knowledge base applications can reasonably ex-
pect to extract useful information.
The performance given in the first row is (like
all previously given performance values) the
function-tagger&apos;s performance on the correctly-
labelled constituents output by our parser. For
comparison, we also give its performance when
run directly on the original treebank parse; since
the parser&apos;s accuracy is about 89%, working di-
rectly with the treebank means our statistics
are over roughly 12% more constituents. This
second version does slightly better.
The main reason that tagging does worse on
the parsed version is that although the con-
stituent itself may be correctly bracketed and la-
belled, its exterior conditioning information can
still be incorrect. An example of this that ac-
tually occurred in the development corpus (sec-
tion 24 of the treebank) is the &apos;that&apos; clause in
the phrase &apos;can swallow the premise that the re-
wards for such ineptitude are six-figure salaries&apos;,
correctly diagrammed in figure 5. The function
tagger gave this SBAR an ADV tag, indicating an
unspecified adverbial function. This seems ex-
tremely odd, given that its conditioning infor-
mation (nodes circled in the figure) clearly show
that it is part of an NP, and hence probably mod-
ifies the preceding NN. Indeed, the statistics give
the probability of an ADV tag in this condition-
ing environment as vanishingly small.

<bodyText confidence="0.999918866666667">
However, this was not the conditioning infor-
mation that the tagger received. The parser
had instead decided on the (incorrect) parse in
figure 6. As such, the tagger&apos;s decision makes
much more sense, since an SBAR under two VPs
whose heads are VB and MD is rather likely to be
an ADV. (For instance, the &apos;although&apos; clause of
the sentence &apos;he can help, although he doesn&apos;t
want to.&apos; has exactly the conditioning environ-
ment given in figure 6, except that its prede-
cessor is a comma; and this SBAR would be cor-
rectly tagged ADV.) The SBAR itself is correctly
bracketed and labelled, so it still gets counted
in the statistics. Happily, this sort of case seems
to be relatively rare.

Another thing that lowers the overall perfor-
mance somewhat is the existence of error and in-
consistency in the treebank tagging. Some tags
seem to have been relatively easy for the human
treebank taggers, and have few errors. Other
tags have explicit caveats that, however well-
justified, proved difficult to remember for the
taggers—for instance, there are 37 instances of
a PP being tagged with LGS (logical subject) in
spite of the guidelines specifically saying, &apos;[LGS]
attaches to the NP object of by and not to the
PP node itself.&apos; (Bies et al., 1995) Each mistag-
ging in the test corpus can cause up to two spu-
rious errors, one in precision and one in recall.
Still another source of difficulty comes when the
guidelines are vague or silent on a specific issue.
To return to logical subjects, it is clear that `the
loss&apos; is a logical subject in &apos;The company was
hurt by the loss&apos;, but what about in &apos;The com-
pany was unperturbed by the loss&apos;? In addition,
a number of the function tags are authorised for
&apos;metaphorical use&apos;, but what exactly constitutes
such a use is somewhat inconsistently marked.
It is as yet unclear just to what degree these
tagging errors in the corpus are affecting our
results.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.906748257142857">
This work presents a method for assigning func-
tion tags to text that has been parsed to the
simple label level. Because of the lack of prior
research on this task, we are unable to com-
pare our results to those of other researchers;
but the results do seem promising. However, a
great deal of future work immediately suggests
itself:
• Although we tested twenty or so feature
trees besides the one given in figure 4, the
space of possible trees is still rather un-
explored. A more systematic investiga-
tion into the advantages of different feature
trees would be useful.
• We could add to the feature tree the val-
ues of other categories of function tag, or
the function tags of various tree-relatives
(parent, sibling).
• One of the weaknesses of the lexical fea-
tures is sparse data; whereas the part of
speech is too coarse to distinguish &apos;by John&apos;
(LGS) from &apos;by Monday&apos; (TMP), the lexi-
cal information may be too sparse. This
could be assisted by clustering the lexical
items into useful categories (names, dates,
etc.), and adding those categories as an ad-
ditional feature type.
• There is no reason to think that this work
could not be integrated directly into the
parsing process, particularly if one&apos;s parser
is already geared partially or entirely to-
wards feature-based statistics; the func-
tion tag information could prove quite use-
ful within the parse itself, to rank several
parses to find the most plausible.

<abstract confidence="0.97943903514377">generally recognized that the common nonterminal labels for syntactic constituents (NP, VP, etc.) do not exhaust the syntactic and semantic information one would like about parts of a syntactic tree. For example, the Penn Treebank gives each constituent zero or more &apos;function tags&apos; indicating semantic roles and other related information not easily encapsulated in the simple constituent labels. We present a statistical algorithm for assigning these function tags that, on text already parsed to a simplelabel level, achieves an F-measure of 87%, which rises to 99% when considering &apos;no tag&apos; as a valid choice. Parsing sentences using statistical information gathered from a treebank was first examined a decade ago in (ChitraD and Grishman, 1990) and is by now a fairly well-studied problem ((Charniak, 1997), (Collins, 1997), (Ratnaparkhi, 1997)). But to date, the end product of the parsing process has for the most part been a bracketing with simple constituent labels like VP, Penn treebank contains a great deal of additional syntactic and semantic information from which to gather statistics; reproducing more of this information automatically is a goal which has so far been mostly ignored. This paper details a process by which some of this information—the function tags— may be recovered automatically. In the Penn treebank, there are 20 tags (figure 1) that can be appended to constituent labels in order to indicate additional information the syntactic or semantic role of the con- * This research was funded in part by NSF grants LIS- SBR-9720368 and IGERT-9870676. stituent. We have divided them into four categories (given in figure 2) based on those in the bracketing guidelines (Bies et al., 1995). A constituent can be tagged with multiple tags, but with two tags from the same In actuality, the case where a constituent has tags from all four categories never happens, but constituents with three tags do occur (rarely). At a high level, we can simply say that having the function tag information for a given text is useful just because any further information would help. But specifically, there are distinct advantages for each of the various categories. Grammatical tags are useful for any application trying to follow the thread of the text—they find the &apos;who does what&apos; of each clause, which can be useful to gain information about the situation or to learn more about the behaviour of the words in the sentence. The form/function tags help to find those constituents behaving in ways not conforming to their labelled type, as well as further clarifying the behaviour of adverbial phrases. Information retrieval applications specialising in describing events, as with a number of the MUC applications, could greatly benefit from some of these in determining the where-when-why of things. Noting a topicalised constituent could also prove useful to these applications, and it might also help in discourse analysis, or pronoun resolution. Finally, the &apos;miscellaneous&apos; tags are convenient at various particularly the related&apos; tag, which among other things marks phrasal verbs and prepositional ditransitives. To our knowledge, there has been no attempt so far to recover the function tags in parsing treebank text. In fact, we know of only is a single exception in the corpus: one conis tagged with appears to be an error. 234 ADV Non-specific adverbial HLN Headline PUT Locative complement of &apos;put&apos; BNF Benefactive LGS Logical subject SBJ Subject CLF It-cleft LOC Location TMP Temporal CLR &apos;Closely related&apos; MNR Manner TPC Topic DIR Direction NOM Nominal TTL Title DTV Dative PRD Predicate VOC Vocative EXT Extent PRP Purpose treebank function tags Grammatical 53.% Form/Function 37.% Topicalisation 2.2% Miscellaneous 9.5% DTV 0.48% 0.25% 100% 2.2% CLR 94.% 8.8% LGS 3.0% 1.5% ADV 11.% 4.2% CLF 0.34% 0.03% PRD 18.% 9.3% BNF 0.072% 0.026% HLN 2.6% 0.25% PUT 0.26% 0.13% DIR 8.3% 3.0% TTL 3.1% 0.29% SBJ 78.% 41.% EXT 3.2% 1.2% VOC 0.025% 0.013% LOC 25.% 9.2% MNR 6.2% 2.3% PRP 5.2% 1.9% TMP 33.% 12.% Figure 2: Categories of function tags and their relative frequencies one project that used them at all: (Collins, 1997) defines certain constituents as complements based on a combination of label and function tag information. This boolean condition is then used to train an improved parser. 2 Features We have found it useful to define our statistimodel in terms of &apos;feature&apos;, in this context, is a boolean-valued function, generally over parse tree nodes and either node labels or lexical items. Features can be fairly simple and easily read off the tree (e.g. &apos;this node&apos;s label is X&apos;, &apos;this node&apos;s parent&apos;s label is Y&apos;), or slightly more complex (`this node&apos;s head&apos;s partof-speech is Z&apos;). This is concordant with the usage in the maximum entropy literature (Berger et al., 1996). When using a number of known features to guess an unknown one, the usual procedure is to calculate the value of each feature, and then essentially look up the empirically most probable value for the feature to be guessed based on those known values. Due to sparse data, some of the features later in the list may need to be ignored; thus the probability of an unknown feature value would be estimated as • • • , • • • , to an empirically observed probability. Of course, if features 1 through i only co-occur a few times in the training, this value may not be reliable, so the empirical probability is usually smoothed: 2, • • • , fi) 12, • • , fi) - • • • , fi-i) • The values for Ai can then be determined according to the number of occurrences of features 1 through i together in the training. One way to think about equation 1 (and the notion that depend on values of Ii as follows: We begin the prior probability of f.If we have data multiply in that likelihood, while dividing out the original prior. If have data for we multiply that while dividing out the (f in) This is repeated for each piece of feature data we have; each point, we are probability 235 P(1111,12) P(1111,12, • • • , fi) • • • , f &lt; f • • • , • • fi-i, fi) • • we already have estimated. If knowledge about makes likely than with just the term where fi is added will be greater than one and the running probability will be adjusted upward. This gives us the new probability shown in equation 3, which is exactly equivalent to equation 1 since everything except the last numerator cancels out of the The value of chosen such that Iifi sufficiently represented in the training data; sometimes all n features are used, but often that would cause sparse data problems. Smoothing is performed on this equation exactly as before: each term is interpolated between the empirical value and the prior estimated probability, according to a value of Ai that estimates confidence. But aside from perhaps providing a new way to think about the problem, equation 3 is not particularly useful as it is—it is exactly the same as what we had before. Its real usefulness comes, as shown in (Charniak, 1999), when we move from the noof a feature a feature These feature chains don&apos;t capture everything we&apos;d like them to. If there are two independent features that are each relatively sparse but occasionally carry a lot of information, then putting one before the other in a chain will effectively block the second from having any effect, since its information is (uselessly) conditioned on the first one, whose sparseness will completely dilute any gain. What we&apos;d really like is to be able have a feature we can condition those two sparse features independently on one common predecessor feature. As we said before, equation 3 represents, for each feature probability of on and all its predivided by the probability of only on the predecessors. In the chain case, this means that the denominator is conditioned on every feature from 1 to i — 1, but if we use a feature tree, it is conditioned only on those features along the path to the root of the tree. A notable issue with feature trees as opposed feature chains is that the terms do out. Every leaf on the tree will be repre- Figure 3: A small example feature tree sented in the numerator, and every fork in the tree (from which multiple nodes depend) will be represented at least once in the denominator. For example: in figure 3 we have a small feature tree that has one target feature and four features. Features independent of each other, but each depends on a; depends directly only on unsmoothed version of the corresponding equation would be c, la)P(fla,b) ha, c) P(f ha, d) P( f) P( f la) P(f la, P( f which, after cancelling of terms and smoothing, results in b, c)P(f ha, d)(4) c, d) p(f la) Note that strictly speaking the result is not a probability distribution. It could be made into one with an appropriate normalisation—the so-called partition function in the maximumentropy literature. However, if the independence assumptions made in the derivation of equation 4 are good ones, the partition function will be close to 1.0. We assume this to be the case for our feature trees. Now we return the discussion to function tagging. There are a number of features that seem tar et feature 236 succeeding precvling abel label function pare grandparent&apos;s tag latel labe h s POS pargnt&apos;s hea par4nt&apos;s head label head&apos;s POS PO alt-head&apos;s POS head alt-ead Figure 4: The feature tree used to guess function tags to condition strongly for one function tag or another; we have assembled them into the feature shown in figure This figure should be relatively self-explanatory, except for the notion of an &apos;alternate head&apos;; currently, an alternate head is only defined for prepositional phrases, and is the head of the object of the prepositional phrase. This data is very important in distinguishing, for example, &apos;by John&apos; (where John might be a logical subject) from &apos;by next year&apos; (a temporal modifier) and &apos;by selling it&apos; (an adverbial indicating manner). 3 Experiment In the training phase of our experiment, we gathered statistics on the occurrence of function tags in sections 2-21 of the Penn treebank. Specifically, for every constituent in the treebank, we recorded the presence of its function tags (or lack thereof) along with its conditioning information. From this we calculated the empirical probabilities of each function tag referenced in section 2 of this paper. Values of A were determined using EM on the development corpus (treebank section 24). then, we simply took the of our parser on the test corpus (treebank section 23), and applied a postprocessing step to add tags. For each constituent in the we calculated the likelihood of each function tag according to the feature tree in figure 4, and for each category (see figure 2) we assigned the most likely function tag (which might be the null tag). reader will note that the &apos;features&apos; listed in the tree are in fact not boolean-valued; each node in the given tree can be assumed to stand for a chain of boolean features, one per potential value at that node, exactly one of which will be true. 4 Evaluation To evaluate our results, we first need to determine what is &apos;correct&apos;. The definition we chose is to call a constituent correct if there exists in the correct parse a constituent with the same start and end points, label, and function tag (or lack thereof). Since we treated each of the four function tag categories as a separate feature for the purpose of tagging, evaluation was also done on a per-category basis. The denominator of the accuracy measure should be the maximum possible number we could get correct. In this case, that means excluding those constituents that were already wrong in the parser output; the parser we used attains 89% labelled precision-recall, so roughly 11% of the constituents are excluded from the accuracy evaluation. reference, we have also included the performance of our function tagger directly on treebank parses; the slight gain that resulted is discussed below.) Another consideration is whether to count non-tagged constituents in our evaluation. On the one hand, we could count as correct any constituent with the correct tag as well as any correctly non-tagged constituent, and use as our denominator the number of all correctlylabelled constituents. (We will henceforth refer to this as the &apos;with-null&apos; measure.) On the other hand, we could just count constituents with the correct tag, and use as our denominators the number of constituents. We believe the latter number (`nonull&apos;) to be a better performance metric, as it is not overwhelmed by the large number of untagged constituents. Both are reported below.</abstract>

First of all, most constituents in the corpus have no tags at all, so obviously one baseline is to simply guess no tag for any constituent. Even for the most common type of function tag (grammatical), this method performs with 87% accuracy. Thus the with-null accuracy of a function tagger needs to be very high to be significant here. The second baseline might be useful in examining the no-null accuracy values (particularly the recall): always guess the most common tag in a category. This means that every constituent gets labelled with `--SBJ-TMP-TPC-CLR&apos; (meaning that it is a topicalised temporal subject that is &apos;closely related&apos; to its verb). This combination of tags is in fact entirely illegal by the treebank guidelines, but performs adequately for a baseline. The precision is, of course, abysmal, for the same reasons the first baseline did so well; but the recall is (as one might expect) substantial. The performances of the two baseline measures are given in Table 1. 5.2 Performance in individual categories In table 2, we give the results for each category. The first column is the with-null accuracy, and the precision and recall values given are the nonull accuracy, as noted in section 4. Grammatical tagging performs the best of the four categories. Even using the more difficult no-null accuracy measure, it has a 96% accuracy. This seems to reflect the fact that grammatical relations can often be guessed based on constituent labels, parts of speech, and highfrequency lexical items, largely avoiding sparsedata problems. Topicalisation can similarly be guessed largely on high-frequency information, and performed almost as well (93%). On the other hand, we have the form/function tags and the &apos;miscellaneous&apos; tags. These are characterised by much more semantic information, and the relationships between lexical items are very important, making sparse data a real problem. All the same, it should be noted that the performance is still far better than the baselines. 5.3 Performance with other feature trees The feature tree given in figure 4 is by no means only feature tree we could have used. In- 238 Table 3: Overall performance on different inputs With-null No -null Category Accuracy Precision Recall F-measure Parsed 98.643% 87.173% 87.381% 87.277% Treebank 98.805% 88.450% 88.493% 88.472% deed, we tried a number of different trees on the development corpus; this tree gave among the best overall results, with no category performing too badly. However, there is no reason to use only one feature tree for all four categories; the best results can be got by using a separate tree for each one. One can thus achieve slight (one to three point) gains in each category. 5.4 Overall performance The overall performance, given in table 3, appears promising. With a tagging accuracy of about 87%, various information retrieval and knowledge base applications can reasonably expect to extract useful information. The performance given in the first row is (like all previously given performance values) the function-tagger&apos;s performance on the correctlylabelled constituents output by our parser. For comparison, we also give its performance when run directly on the original treebank parse; since the parser&apos;s accuracy is about 89%, working directly with the treebank means our statistics are over roughly 12% more constituents. This second version does slightly better. The main reason that tagging does worse on the parsed version is that although the constituent itself may be correctly bracketed and labelled, its exterior conditioning information can still be incorrect. An example of this that actually occurred in the development corpus (section 24 of the treebank) is the &apos;that&apos; clause in the phrase &apos;can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six-figure salaries&apos;, correctly diagrammed in figure 5. The function gave this ADV tag, indicating an unspecified adverbial function. This seems extremely odd, given that its conditioning information (nodes circled in the figure) clearly show it is part of an hence probably modthe preceding the statistics give probability of an in this conditioning environment as vanishingly small. 5: and conditioning info 6: and info, as parsed However, this was not the conditioning information that the tagger received. The parser had instead decided on the (incorrect) parse in figure 6. As such, the tagger&apos;s decision makes more sense, since an two heads are MD is rather likely to be instance, the &apos;although&apos; clause of the sentence &apos;he can help, although he doesn&apos;t want to.&apos; has exactly the conditioning environment given in figure 6, except that its predeis a comma; and this be cortagged ADV.) The is correctly bracketed and labelled, so it still gets counted in the statistics. Happily, this sort of case seems to be relatively rare. SBAR swallow premise (that) VP (VP IP) swallowDir the (that) premise 239 Another thing that lowers the overall performance somewhat is the existence of error and inconsistency in the treebank tagging. Some tags seem to have been relatively easy for the human treebank taggers, and have few errors. Other tags have explicit caveats that, however welljustified, proved difficult to remember for the taggers—for instance, there are 37 instances of tagged with subject) in spite of the guidelines specifically saying, &apos;[LGS] attaches to the NP object of by and not to the PP node itself.&apos; (Bies et al., 1995) Each mistagging in the test corpus can cause up to two spurious errors, one in precision and one in recall. Still another source of difficulty comes when the guidelines are vague or silent on a specific issue. To return to logical subjects, it is clear that `the loss&apos; is a logical subject in &apos;The company was hurt by the loss&apos;, but what about in &apos;The company was unperturbed by the loss&apos;? In addition, a number of the function tags are authorised for &apos;metaphorical use&apos;, but what exactly constitutes such a use is somewhat inconsistently marked. It is as yet unclear just to what degree these tagging errors in the corpus are affecting our results. 6 Conclusion This work presents a method for assigning function tags to text that has been parsed to the simple label level. Because of the lack of prior research on this task, we are unable to compare our results to those of other researchers; but the results do seem promising. However, a great deal of future work immediately suggests itself: • Although we tested twenty or so feature trees besides the one given in figure 4, the space of possible trees is still rather unexplored. A more systematic investigation into the advantages of different feature trees would be useful. • We could add to the feature tree the values of other categories of function tag, or the function tags of various tree-relatives (parent, sibling). • One of the weaknesses of the lexical features is sparse data; whereas the part of speech is too coarse to distinguish &apos;by John&apos; from &apos;by Monday&apos; lexical information may be too sparse. This could be assisted by clustering the lexical items into useful categories (names, dates, etc.), and adding those categories as an additional feature type. • There is no reason to think that this work could not be integrated directly into the parsing process, particularly if one&apos;s parser is already geared partially or entirely towards feature-based statistics; the function tag information could prove quite useful within the parse itself, to rank several parses to find the most plausible.</abstract>

We present a statistical algorithm for assigning these function tags that, on text already parsed to a simplelabel level, achieves an F-measure of 87%, which rises to 99% when considering &apos;no tag&apos; as a valid choice. 1 Introduction Parsing sentences using statistical information gathered from a treebank was first examined a decade ago in (ChitraD and Grishman, 1990) and is by now a fairly well-studied problem ((Charniak, 1997), (Collins, 1997), (Ratnaparkhi, 1997)). But to date, the end product of the parsing process has for the most part been a bracketing with simple constituent labels like NP, VP, or SBAR. The Penn treebank contains a great deal of additional syntactic and semantic information from which to gather statistics; reproducing more of this information automatically is a goal which has so far been mostly ignored. This paper details a process by which some of this information—the function tags— may be recovered automatically.

The value of j is chosen such that features Ii fi are sufficiently represented in the training data; sometimes all n features are used, but often that would cause sparse data problems. Smoothing is performed on this equation exactly as before: each term is interpolated between the empirical value and the prior estimated probability, according to a value of Ai that estimates confidence. But aside from perhaps providing a new way to think about the problem, equation 3 is not particularly useful as it is—it is exactly the same as what we had before. Its real usefulness comes, as shown in (Charniak, 1999), when we move from the notion of a feature chain to a feature tree. These feature chains don&apos;t capture everything we&apos;d like them to. If there are two independent features that are each relatively sparse but occasionally carry a lot of information, then putting one before the other in a chain will effectively block the second from having any effect, since its information is (uselessly) conditioned on the first one, whose sparseness will completely dilute any gain. What we&apos;d really like is to be able to have a feature tree, whereby we can condition those two sparse features independently on one</context>

A &apos;feature&apos;, in this context, is a boolean-valued function, generally over parse tree nodes and either node labels or lexical items. Features can be fairly simple and easily read off the tree (e.g. &apos;this node&apos;s label is X&apos;, &apos;this node&apos;s parent&apos;s label is Y&apos;), or slightly more complex (`this node&apos;s head&apos;s partof-speech is Z&apos;).
