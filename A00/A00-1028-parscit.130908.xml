Sophisticated grammar formalisms, such as LFG, al-
low concisely capturing complex linguistic phenom-
ena. The powerful operators provided by such for-
malisms can however introduce spurious ambigu-
ity, making parsing inefficient. A simple form of
corpus-based grammar pruning is evaluated experi-
mentally on two wide-coverage grammars, one En-
glish and one French. Speedups of up to a factor 6
were obtained, at a cost in grammatical coverage of
about 13%. A two-stage architecture allows achiev-
ing significant speedups without introducing addi-
tional parse failures.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989536585366">
Expressive grammar formalisms allow grammar de-
velopers to capture complex linguistic generaliza-
tions concisely and elegantly, thus greatly facilitat-
ing grammar development and maintenance. (Car-
rol, 1994) found that the empirical performance
when parsing with unification-based grammars is
nowhere near the theoretical worst-case complexity.
Nonetheless, directly parsing with such grammars,
in the form they were developed, can be very ineffi-
cient. For this reason, grammars are typically com-
piled into representations that allow faster parsing.
This does however not solve the potential problem
of the grammars overgenerating considerably, thus
allowing large amounts of spurious ambiguity. In-
deed, a current trend in high-coverage parsing, es-
pecially when employing a statistical model of lan-
guage, see, e.g., (Collins 97), is to allow the grammar
to massively overgenerate and instead disambiguate
by statistical means during or after parsing. If the
benefits resulting from more concise grammatical de-
scriptions are to outweigh the costs of spurious am-
biguity, the latter must be brought down.
In such a situation, corpus-based compilation
techniques can drastically improve parsing perfor-
mance without burdening the grammar developer.
The initial, and much seminal work in this area
was been carried out by Rayner and coworkers, see
(Rayner 1988), (Samuelsson and Rayner 91) and
(Rayner and Carter 1996). In the current article,
we apply similar ideas to Lexical Functional Gram-
mar (LFG) in the incarnation of the Xerox Linguis-
tic Environment (XLE). The goal is to investigate
to what extent corpus-based compilation techniques
can reduce overgeneration and spurious ambiguity,
and increase parsing efficiency, without jeopardiz-
ing coverage. The rest of the article is organized
as follows: Section 2 presents the relevant aspects
of the LFG formalism and the pruning strategy em-
ployed, Section 3 describes the experimental setup,
Section 4 reports the experimental results and Sec-
tion 5 relates this to other work.

2 LFG and Grammar Pruning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900766666667">
The LFG formalism (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) al-
lows the right-hand sides (RHS) of grammar rules to
consist of a regular expression over grammar sym-
bols. This makes it more appropriate to refer to
the grammar rules as rule schemata, since each RHS
can potentially be expanded into a (possibly infinite)
number of distinct sequences of grammar symbols,
each corresponding to a traditional phrase-structure
rule. As can easily be imagined, the use of regular-
expression operators such as Kleene-star and com-
plementation may introduce a considerable amount
of spurious ambiguity. Moreover, the LFG formal-
ism provides operators which — although not in-
creasing its theoretical expressive power — allow
rules to be written more concisely. Examples of such
operators are the ignore operator, which allows skip-
ping any sequence of grammar symbols that matches
a given pattern; the shuffle operator, which allows
a set of grammar symbols to occur in any order;
and the linear precedence operator, which allows par-
tially specifying the order of grammar symbols.
The pruning method we propose consists in elim-
inating complex operators from the grammar de-
scription by considering how they were actually in-
stantiated when parsing a corpus. In LFGs, each
rule scheme corresponds to a particular grammar
symbol, since different expansions of the same sym-
bol are expressed as alternatives in the regular ex-
pression on its RHS. We can define a specific path
through the RHS of a rule scheme by the choices
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997582">

made when matching it against some sequence of
grammar symbols. Our training data allows us to
derive, for each training example, the choices made
at each rule expansion. By applying these choices to
the rule scheme in isolation, we can derive a phrase-
structure rule from it.
The grammar is specialized, or pruned, by retain-
ing all and only those phrase-structure rules that
correspond to a path taken through a rule scheme
when expanding some node in some training exam-
ple. Since the grammar formalism requires that each
LHS occur only in one rule scheme in the gram-
mar, extracted rules with the same LHS symbol are
merged into a single rule scheme with a disjunction
operator at its top level. For instance, if a rule
scheme with the structure
A —4 B* {C I D}
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.889682">
is expanded in the training data only in the following
ways
A C
A -4. BC
A BD
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.974984043478261">
then it will be replaced by a rule scheme with the
following structure
A -4 {C I BC I BD}
The same approach is taken to replace all regular-
expression operators, other than concatenation, with
the actual sequences of grammar symbols that are
matched against them. A more realistic example,
taken from the actual data, is shown in Figure 1:
none of the optional alternative portions following
the V is ever used in any correct parse in the corpus.
Moreover, the ADV P preceding the V occurs only
0 or 1 times in correct parses.
Like other unification-based formalisms, lexical
functional grammars allow grammar rules to be an-
notated with sets of feature-based constraints, here
called &amp;quot;functional descriptions&amp;quot;, whose purpose is
both to enforce additional constraints on rule appli-
cability and to build an enriched predicate-argument
structure called &amp;quot;f-structure&amp;quot;, which, together with
the parse tree, constitutes the output of the parsing
process. As these constraints are maintained verba-
tim in the specialized version of the rule scheme, this
poses no problem for this form of grammar pruning.

3 Experimental Setup
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994855587301588">
The experiments carried out to determine the ef-
fectiveness of corpus-based specialization were per-
formed as illustrated in Figure 2. Two broad-
coverage LFG grammars were used, one for French
and one for English, both of which were developed
within the Pargram project (Butt et al., 1999) dur-
ing several years time. The French grammar consists
of 133 rule schemata, the English grammar of 85 rule
schemata.
Each grammar is equipped with a treebank, which
was developed for other purposes than grammar spe-
cialization. Each treebank was produced by letting
the system parse a corpus of technical documenta-
tion. Any sentence that did not obtain any parse
was discarded. At this point, the French corpus
was reduced to 960 sentences, and the English cor-
pus to 970. The average sentence length was 9 for
French and 8 for English. For each sentence, a hu-
man expert then selected the most appropriate anal-
ysis among those returned by the parser.
In the current experiments, each treebank was
used to specialize the grammar it had been devel-
oped with. A set of 10-fold cross-validation experi-
ments was carried out to measure several interesting
quantities under different conditions. This means
that, for each language, the corpus was randomly
split into ten equal parts, and one tenth at a time
was held out for testing while the remaining nine
tenths were used to specialize the grammar, and the
results were averaged over the ten runs. For each
grammar the average number of parses per sentence,
the fraction of sentences which still received at least
one parse (anyparse) and the fraction of sentences for
which the parse selected by the expert was still de-
rived (coverage) were measuredl. The average CPU
time required by parsing was also measured, and this
was used to compute the speedup with respect to the
original grammar.
The thus established results constitute one data
point in the trade-off between ambiguity reduction
on one side, which is in turn related to parsing speed,
and loss in coverage on the other. In order to deter-
mine other points of this trade-off, the same set of
experiments was performed where specialization was
inhibited for certain rule schemata. In particular, for
each grammar, the two rule schemata that received
the largest number of distinct expansions in the cor-
pora were determined. These proved to be those
associated with the LHS symbols &apos;VPverb[rnainV
and &apos;NP&apos; for the French grammar, and &apos;VPv&apos; and
&apos;NPadj&apos; for the English one.&apos; The experiments were
repeated while inhibiting specialization of first the
scheme with the most expansions, and then the two
most expanded schemata.
Measures of coverage and speedup are important
1 As long as we are interested in preserving the f-structure
assigned to sentences, this notion of coverage is stricter than
necessary. The same f-structure can in fact be assigned by
more than one parse, so that in some cases a sentence is con-
sidered out of coverage even if the specialized grammar assigns
to it the correct f-structure.
2&apos;VPv&apos; and &apos;VPverb[mainl&apos; cover VPs headed by a main
verb. &apos;NPadj&apos; covers NPs with adjectives attached.

indicators of what can be achieved with this form of
grammar pruning. However, they could potentially
be misleading, since failure times for uncovered sen-
tences might be considerably lower than their pars-
ing times, had they not been out of coverage. If
the pruned grammar fails more frequently on sen-
tences which take longer to parse, the measured
speedup might be artificially high. This is easily
realized, as simply removing the hardest sentences
from the corpus would cause a decrease in the av-
erage parsing time, and thus result in a speedup,
without any pruning at all. To factor out the contri-
bution of uncovered sentences from the results, the
performance of a two-stage architecture analogous
to that of (Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991) was sim-
ulated, in which the pruned grammar is attempted

first, and the sentence is passed on to the original
unpruned grammar whenever the pruned grammar
fails to return a parse (see Figure 3). The mea-
sured speedup of this simulated architecture, which
preserves the anyparse nieasure of the original gram-
mar, takes into account the contribution of uncov-
ered sentences, as it penalizes sweeping difficult sen-
tences under the carpet.

4 Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993444444445">
The results of the experiments described in the sec-
tion above are summarized in the table in Figure 4.
The upper part of the table refers to experiments
with the French grammar, the lower part to exper-
iments with the English grammar. For each lan-
guage, the first line presents data gathered for the
original grammar for comparison with the pruned
grammars. The figures in the second line were col-
lected by pruning the grammar based on the whole
corpus, and then testing on the corpus itself. The
grammars obtained in this way contain 516 and 388
disjuncts — corresponding to purely concatenative
rules — for French and English respectively. Any-
parse and coverage are not, of course, relevant in
this case, but the statistics on parsing time are, es-
pecially the one on the maximum parsing time. For
each iteration in the 10-fold cross-validation experi-
ment, the maximum parsing time was retained, and
those ten times were eventually averaged. If pruning
tended to leave sentences which take long to parse
uncovered, then we would observe a significant dif-
ference between the average over maximum times on
the grammar trained and tested on the same corpus
(which parses all sentences, including the hardest),
and the average over maximum times for grammars
trained and tested on different sets. The fact that
this does not seem to be the case indicates that prun-
ing does not penalize difficult sentences. Note also
that the average number of parses per sentence is
significantly smaller than with the full grammar, of
almost a factor of 9 in the case of the French gram-
mar.
The third line contains results for the fully pruned
grammar. In the case of the French grammar a
speedup of about 6 is obtained with a loss in cov-
erage of 13%. The smaller speedup gained with
the English grammar can be explained by the fact
that here, the parsing times are lower in general,
and that a non-negligible part of this time, espe-
cially that needed for morphological analysis, is un-
affected by pruning. Even in the case of the English
grammar, though, speedup is substantial (2.67). For
both grammars, the reduction in the average max-
imum parsing time is particularly good, confirming
our hypothesis that trimming the grammar by re-
moving heavy constructs makes it considerably more
efficient. A partially negative note comes from the
average number of disjuncts in the prun.ed gram-
mars, which is 501 for French and 374 for English.
Comparing this figures to the number of disjuncts in
grammars pruned on the full corpus (516 and 388),
we find that after training on nine tenths of the cor-
pus, adding the last tenth still leads to an increase
of 3-4% in the size of the resulting grammars. In
other words, the marginal gain of further training
examples is still significant after considering about
900 sentences, indicating that the training corpora
are somewhat too small.
The last two lines for each language show figures
for grammars with pruning inhibited on the most.
variable and the two most variable symbols respec-
tively. For both languages, inhibiting pruning on the
most variable symbol has the expected effect of in-
creasing both parsing time and coverage. Inhibiting
pruning also on the second most variable symbol has
almost no effect for French, and only a small effect
for English.
The table in Figure 5 summarizes the measures
on the simulated two-stage architecture. For both
languages the best trade-off, once the distribution
of uncovered sentences has been taken into account,
is achieved by the fully pruned grammars.

The line of work described in (Rayner, 1988;
Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991; Rayner and Carter,
1996; Samuelsson, 1994) deals with unification-
based grammars that already have a purely-
concatenative context-free backbone, and is more
concerned with a different form of specialization,
consisting in the application of explanation-based
learning (EBL). Here, the central idea is to collect
the most frequently occurring subtrees in a treebank
and use them as atomic units for parsing. The cited
works differ mainly in the criteria adopted for select-
ing subtrees from the treebank. In (Rayner, 1988;
Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991; Rayner and Carter,
1996) these criteria are handcoded: all subtrees sat-
isfying some properties are selected, and a new gram-
mar rule is created by flattening each such subtree,
i.e., by taking the root as left-hand side and the yield
as right-hand side, and in the process performing all
unifications corresponding to the thus removed in-
ternal nodes. Experiments carried out on a corpus
of 15,000 trees from the ATIS domain using a ver-
sion of the SRI Core Language Engine resulted in a
speedup of about 3.4 at a cost of 5% in grammati-
cal coverage, which however was compensated by an
increase in parsing accuracy.
Finding suitable tree-cutting criteria requires a
considerable amount of work, and must be repeated
for each new grammar and for each new domain to
which the grammar is to be specialized. Samuelsson
(Samuelsson, 1994) proposes a technique to auto-
matically selects what subtrees to retain. The se-
lection of appropriate subtrees is done by choosing
a subset of nodes at which to cut trees. Cutnodes
are determined by computing the entropy of each
node, and selecting only those nodes whose entropy
exceeds a given threshold. Intuitively, nodes with
low entropy indicate locations in the trees where a
given symbol was expanded using a predictable set
of rules, at least most of the times, so that the loss
of coverage that derives from ignoring the remain-
ing cases is low. Nodes with high entropy, on the
other hand, indicate positions in which there is a
high uncertainty in what rule was used to expand
the symbol, so that it is better to preserve all alter-
natives. Several schemas are proposed to compute
entropies, each leading to a different trade-off be-
</bodyText>

tween coverage reduction and speedup. In general,
results are not quite as good as those obtained using
handcoded criteria, though of course the specialized
grammar is obtained fully automatically, and thus
with much less effort.
When ignoring issues related to the elimination of
complex operators from the RHS of rule schemata,
the grammar-pruning strategy described in the cur-
rent article is equivalent to explanation-based learn-
ing where all nodes have been selected, as cutnodes.
Conversely, EBL can be viewed as higher-order
grammar pruning, removing not grammar rules, but
grammar-rule combinations.
Some of the work done on data-oriented parsing
(DOP) (Bod, 1993; Bod and Scha, 1996; Bod and
Kaplan, 1998; Sima&apos;an, 1999) can also be considered
related to our work, as it can be seen as a way to
specialize in an EBL-like way the (initially unknown)
grammar implicitly underlying a treebank.
(Srinivas and Joshi, 1995) and (Neumann, 1997)
apply EBL to speed up parsing with tree-adjoining
grammars and sentence generation with HPSGs re-
spectively, though they do so by introducing new
components in their systems rather then by modify-
ing the grammars they use.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999663677419355">
Sophisticated grammar formalisms are very useful
and convenient when designing high-coverage gram-
mars for natural languages. Very expressive gram-
matical constructs can make the task of develop-
ing and maintaining such a large resource consid-
erably easier. On the other hand, their use can re-
sult in a considerable increase in grammatical am-
biguity. Grammar-compilation techniques based on
grammar structure alone are insufficient remedies in
those cases, as they cannot access the information
required to determine which alternatives to retain
and which alternatives to discard.
The current article demonstrates that a relatively
simple pruning technique, employing the kind of ref-
erence corpus that is typically used for grammar de-
velopment and thus often already available, can sig-
nificantly improve parsing performance. On large
lexical functional grammars, speedups of up to a
factor 6 were observed, at the price of a reduction
in grammatical coverage of about 13%. A simple
two-stage architecture was also proposed that pre-
serves the anyparse measure of the original gram-
mar, demonstrating that significant speedups can be
obtained without increasing the number of parsing
failures.
Future work includes extending the study of
corpus-based grammar specialization from first-
order grammar pruning to higher-order gram-
mar pruning, thus extending previous work on
explanation-based learning for parsing, and apply-
ing it to the LFG formalism.

<abstract confidence="0.998104846153846">Sophisticated grammar formalisms, such as LFG, allow concisely capturing complex linguistic phenomena. The powerful operators provided by such formalisms can however introduce spurious ambiguity, making parsing inefficient. A simple form of corpus-based grammar pruning is evaluated experimentally on two wide-coverage grammars, one English and one French. Speedups of up to a factor 6 were obtained, at a cost in grammatical coverage of about 13%. A two-stage architecture allows achieving significant speedups without introducing additional parse failures.</abstract>

As these constraints are maintained verbatim in the specialized version of the rule scheme, this poses no problem for this form of grammar pruning. 3 Experimental Setup The experiments carried out to determine the effectiveness of corpus-based specialization were performed as illustrated in Figure 2. Two broadcoverage LFG grammars were used, one for French and one for English, both of which were developed within the Pargram project (Butt et al., 1999) during several years time. The French grammar consists of 133 rule schemata, the English grammar of 85 rule schemata. Each grammar is equipped with a treebank, which was developed for other purposes than grammar specialization. Each treebank was produced by letting the system parse a corpus of technical documentation. Any sentence that did not obtain any parse was discarded. At this point, the French corpus was reduced to 960 sentences, and the English corpus to 970. The average sentence length was 9 for French and 8 for English.

A two-stage architecture allows achieving significant speedups without introducing additional parse failures. 1 Introduction Expressive grammar formalisms allow grammar developers to capture complex linguistic generalizations concisely and elegantly, thus greatly facilitating grammar development and maintenance. (Carrol, 1994) found that the empirical performance when parsing with unification-based grammars is nowhere near the theoretical worst-case complexity. Nonetheless, directly parsing with such grammars, in the form they were developed, can be very inefficient. For this reason, grammars are typically compiled into representations that allow faster parsing. This does however not solve the potential problem of the grammars overgenerating considerably, thus allowing large amounts of spurious ambiguity. Indeed, a current trend in high-coverage parsing, especially when employing a statistical model of language, se</context>

This makes it more appropriate to refer to the grammar rules as rule schemata, since each RHS can potentially be expanded into a (possibly infinite) number of distinct sequences of grammar symbols, each corresponding to a traditional phrase-structure rule. As can easily be imagined, the use of regularexpression operators such as Kleene-star and complementation may introduce a considerable amount of spurious ambiguity. Moreover, the LFG formalism provides operators which — although not i</context>

If the pruned grammar fails more frequently on sentences which take longer to parse, the measured speedup might be artificially high. This is easily realized, as simply removing the hardest sentences from the corpus would cause a decrease in the average parsing time, and thus result in a speedup, without any pruning at all. To factor out the contribution of uncovered sentences from the results, the performance of a two-stage architecture analogous to that of (Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991) was simulated, in which the pruned grammar is attempted 206 &amp;quot;A Sentence&amp;quot; Fails Succeeds Time = Timespecialized Time = Tilliespecialized+ Time original Figure 3: A schematic representation of the simulated two-stage coverage-preserving architecture. first, and the sentence is passed on to the original unpruned grammar whenever the pruned grammar fails to return a parse (see Figure 3).

The line of work described in (Rayner, 1988; Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991; Rayner and Carter, 1996; Samuelsson, 1994) deals with unificationbased grammars that already have a purelyconcatenative context-free backbone, and is more concerned with a different form of specialization, consisting in the application of explanation-based learning (EBL). Here, the central idea is to collect the most frequently occurring subtrees in a treebank and use them as atomic units for parsing. The cited works differ mainly in the criteria adopted for selecting subtrees from the treebank. In (Rayner, 1988; Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991; Rayner and Carter, 1996) these criteria are handcoded: all subtrees satisfying some properties are selected, and a new grammar rule is created by flattening each such subtree, i.e., by taking the root as left-hand side and the yield as right-hand side, and in the process performing all unifications corresponding to the thus removed internal nodes.

Experiments carried out on a corpus of 15,000 trees from the ATIS domain using a version of the SRI Core Language Engine resulted in a speedup of about 3.4 at a cost of 5% in grammatical coverage, which however was compensated by an increase in parsing accuracy. Finding suitable tree-cutting criteria requires a considerable amount of work, and must be repeated for each new grammar and for each new domain to which the grammar is to be specialized. Samuelsson (Samuelsson, 1994) proposes a technique to automatically selects what subtrees to retain. The selection of appropriate subtrees is done by choosing a subset of nodes at which to cut trees. Cutnodes are determined by computing the entropy of each node, and selecting only those nodes whose entropy exceeds a given threshold. Intuitively, nodes with low entropy indicate locations in the trees where a given symbol was expanded using a predictable set of rules, at least most of the times, so that the loss of coverage that derives from ignoring the remaining cases is low. Nodes with high entropy, on the other hand, in</context>

When ignoring issues related to the elimination of complex operators from the RHS of rule schemata, the grammar-pruning strategy described in the current article is equivalent to explanation-based learning where all nodes have been selected, as cutnodes. Conversely, EBL can be viewed as higher-order grammar pruning, removing not grammar rules, but grammar-rule combinations.
