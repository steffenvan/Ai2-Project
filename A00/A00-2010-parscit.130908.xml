The linear logic (Girard, 1987) provides a power-
ful framework to express categorial grammars (Aj-
dukiewicz, 1935) and Lambek calculus (Lambek, 1958),
and a lot of work has presented proof nets uses for lin-
guistic purposes, with a special look at proof nets for
Lambek calculus (Roorda, 1991; Lamarche and Retore,
1996). But they have mainly explored the syntactic ca-
pabilities of proof nets, describing parsing processes.
This paper wants to focus on the generation capa-
bilities of proof nets thanks to their semantic readings
as expressed in (de Groote and Retore, 1996). The
main features of our proposal consist in the use of proof
nets for Lambek calculus, of the Curry-Howard iso-
morphism (Howard, 1980; Girard et al., 1988), of se-
mantic proof nets with semantic expressions a la Mon-
tague (Montague, 1974; Dowty et al., 1981), and in an
algorithm for proof search with a target proof net.
Unlike a previous proposal for generation in the Lam-
bek calculus framework (Merenciano and Morrill, 1997),
this point of view avoids the use of the A-term unification
to lead the generation process. And the algorithmic un-
decidabi lily of this latter mechanism (from second order
unification) does not occur any more.
In this work, we do not consider the choice of lexi-
cal items from a given semantic expression the syntactic
realization of which we want to generate, but rather the
way we can associate given lexical entries to fit the given
semantic expression and generate a syntactically correct
expression. For this purpose, we express our problem as
a proof search one in (multiplicative) linear logic which
is decidable. Moreover, we characterize the semantic
recipes of lexical items that provide a polynomial solu-
tion for the generation process.

2.1 Proof Nets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998114694444444">
(Girard, 1987) introduced proof nets formalism as the
natural deduction syntax for linear logic, also studied
in (Retore, 1993). They represent proofs in linear logic
with more accuracy than sequential proofs: on one hand
they are more compact, on the other hand they identify
unessentially different sequential proofs (for instance in
the order of the rules introduction).
From a one-sided sequent and a sequential proof of
it, we obtain a proof net by unfolding every formula as
a tree (whose nodes are the binary connectives and the
leaves are formulas, e.g. atomic ones) and linking to-
gether the formulas occurring in the same axiom rule of
the sequent calculus.
But proof nets have a more intrinsic definition that pre-
vents us to come back every time to sequential proofs.
They can be defined as graphs with a certain property
(i.e. verifying a correctness criterion) such that every
proof net with this property corresponds to a sequential
proof and such that every proof net built from a sequen-
tial proof has this property. So that we do not present the
sequent calculus but only the proof net calculus.
In this paper, we do not consider all the proof nets, but
a part of the multiplicative ones: those of the intuition-
istic implicative linear logic. In this case, sequents are
made of several antecedent formulas, but only one succe-
dent formula. To deal with the intuitionistic notion with
proof nets (since we consider one-sided sequents), we
use the notion of polarities with the input (.: negative)
and the output (o: positive) (Danos, 1990; Lamarche,
1995) to decorate formulas. Positive ones correspond to
succedent formulas and negative ones to antecedent for-
mulas.
Given the links of table 1, we define proof structures
as graphs made of these links such that:
I. any premise of any link is connected to exactly one
conclusion of some other link;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99805825">
2. any conclusion of any link is connected to at most
one premise of some other link;
3. input (resp. output) premises are connected to input
(resp. output) conclusions of the same type.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988865363636364">
Note that the two links for the negative and positive
implications correspond to the two connectives of the lin-
ear logic: Tensor and Par, so that we name these links
after these latter connectives. But in the following, only
the graphical forms of the links play a role.
Proof nets are proof structures that respect the correct-
ness criterion.
We mentioned the intrinsic definition of proof nets that
enables the complete representation of sequential proofs.
The cut elimination property of sequent calculus also ap-
pears intrinsically in the proof net formalism with a sim-

2.2 Syntactic Proof Nets

<bodyText confidence="0.999692">
Definitions of proof nets for Lambek calculus first ap-
peared in (Roorda, 1991). They naturally raised as Lam-
bek calculus is an intuitionistic fragment of non commu-
tative linar logic (with two linear implications: 1&amp;quot; on
the left and &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; on the right), and the consequences on
the proof net calculus we presented in section 2.1 are:

<listItem confidence="0.989153875">
• we get two tensor links: one for the formulas
( 8/.4 ) (the one in table 1) and one for the for-
mula (B \ A) - (just inverse the polarities of the
premises). And two par links : one for the formula
(A\B)+ and one for (A/B)+ (idem);
• formulas in Lambek&apos;s sequents are ordered, so that
conclusions of the proof nets are cyclically ordered
and axiom links may not cross.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.939406823529412">
If T,, is the set of basic types (e.g. 5&apos;, NP . ..), the set
T of syntactic types follows T ::= TpIT\TIT
Note that from a syntactic category, we can unfold the
formula to obtain a graph which only lacks axiom links
to become a proof structure. So that the parsing process
in this framework is, given the syntactic categories of the
items and their order, to put non crossing axiom links
such that the proof structure is a proof net. It means there
is a proof of given types in a certain order. For tech-
nical reasons, the order of the conclusions (i.e. the types
used) in the proof net to prove S is the reverse order of
the words associated to these types.
As an example, with the lexicon of table 3, proving
that John lives in Paris is a correct sentence leads to find
axiom links between the atoms in the figure 1(a). Fig-
ure 1(b) shows it actually happens and proves the syn-
tactic correctness of the sentence.

2.3 Semantic Proof Nets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978083333333">
In this section, we present how (de Groote and Retore,
1996) propose to use proof nets as semantic recipes. As
a slight difference with this work, we only deal in this
paper with semantic recipes that correspond to linear .\-
terms in the Montague&apos;s semantics framework.
The idea of expressing the semantics with proof
nets refers to the fact that both the A-terms (with the
Curry-Howard isomorphism) and the proof nets repre-
sent proofs of intuitionistic implicative linear logic. And
indeed, the linear A-terms may be encoded as proof nets.
On the other hand, given an intuitionistic implicative
proof net, a simple algorithm (given in (de Groote and

Retore, 1996), based on (Lamarche, 1995)&apos;s dependency
paths). we can obtain a A-term.
Then, instead of associating a A-term to a lexical entry,
we can associate a proof net. For instance, on the seman-
tic side, we can use the Montagovian types e and and
typed constants. Of course, we want to keep the compo-
sitionality principle of Montague&apos;s semantics that maps
any syntactic association rule with a semantic associa-
tion rule. We express it in a straightforward way with the
following homomorphism (for as many basic categories
as required):

<equation confidence="0.9556545">

And for a lexical item, given its syntactic type, we as-
sume its semantic proof net to verify:

Let us illustrate the process on a short example. We
use the lexicon of table 4 to parse the sentence John lives
in Paris. The first thing is to define with the syntactic cat-
egories of the different lexical items the syntactic proof
net of figure 2. It provides the way we should compose
the semantic recipes of each lexical item: we take its ho-
momorphic image as in figure 4(a), and we substitute to
every input its semantic definition with cut-links.
Then the cut-elimination on the resulting proof net
gives a new proof net (on figure 4(b)) we can use as the
semantic analysis of John lives in Paris. If necessary, we
can come back to the A-term expression:(in p)(live j).

3 Generation: Stating the Problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981564545454545">
Let us now consider the problem of generation. We have
a given semantic proof net (like the one in figure 4(b))
and we want to gather syntactic entries with axiom links
such that:
I. this yields a correct (syntactic) proof net;
2. the meaning of the resulting proof net matches the
given semantic expression.
As we already said it, we assume that we have some lex-
ical entries, and we try to make the generation with these
entries, each one used once and only once.
Thus, if we define:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997558888888889">
• 110 the semantic proof net of the expression we want
to generate;
• Hi the semantic proof nets associated to the given
lexical entries i we use;
• Ti the unfolding in proof structure of the syntactic
formula of the lexical item i;
• F the forest made of the syntactic trees of all the
considered lexical entries plus the output (the type
we want to derive).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.991159047619048">
The generation problem (see figure 5) is to find a match-
ing Al of atomic formulas of F such that:
I. F endowed with Al (let us call this proof structure
F&apos;) is a correct proof net;
2. when cut-linking H(F&apos;) with the Ili, and eliminat-
ing these cuts, we obtain 110.
This problem is not an original one: making proof
search with proof nets always leads to look for match-
ing between atomic formulas of opposite polarities. So
that an answer to this problem would consist in taking F
and try every possible matching. This brute-force tech-
nique would of course appear essentially inefficient, and
our purpose is to use everything we know to prune the
search domain.
Nevertheless, note that even with such an algorithm,
we already reach the decidability (because the finitness
of the number of the matchings) without making any as-
sumption on the form of the semantic entries (neither on
the order of the associated A-terms, nor the presence of a
free variable). And we want to keep these good proper-
ties in our algorithm.

This section first establishes some equivalent relations
between cut-elimination on proof nets and matrix equa-
tions. We then show how to use these equations in the

First, as expressed in (Girard, 1989) and reformulated
in (Retore. 1990; Girard, 1993; Girard, 1995), we state
the algebraic representation of cut-elimination on proof
nets. Due to lack of space, we can not develop it, but the
principle is to express cut-elimination between axioms
with incidence matrices and paths in graphs.
Let us consider a proof net U. We denote by (ci )1&lt;i‹,
all the vertices taking place for atoms in U. We can
define U the incidence matrix of axiom links, a the in-
cidence matrix of cut links (we assume without loss of
generality that they happen only between axiom links),
and H the incidence matrix of axiom links of fl where 1-1
is the proof net resulting from all the cut eliminations on

In the problem we are dealing with, we know II and some

• Vi E [1. p].ei is not cut-linked (then, because of

In this case, it is correct.

<bodyText confidence="0.999972789473684">
We took advantage of proof nets on the semantic point
of view and we expressed the generation process as a
guided proof search. On top of keeping the decidability
property of this framework, we characterized the seman-
tic proof nets that enable a polynomial time process.
Such properties are crucial because it is the central part
of the generation process (considering Lambek calculus).
But there are other things left to look at. As the very next
steps. we should work on the atoms numbering and the
choice of the lexical items. Appropriate interactions be-
tween word order contraints and matrix resolution in the
hard case should also be considered. Moreover, another
point is to benefit from the power of linear logic and deal
with non linear A-terms.
Finally, since different extensions of Lambek calcu-
lus based on proof nets (Moortgat, 1996; Lecomte and
Retore, 1995) have been considered, we hope our pro-
posal and its good properties to apply to other linguistic
approaches.

Moreover, we characterize the semantic recipes of lexical items that provide a polynomial solution for the generation process. 2 Multi Usage Proof Nets 2.1 Proof Nets (Girard, 1987) introduced proof nets formalism as the natural deduction syntax for linear logic, also studied in (Retore, 1993). They represent proofs in linear logic with more accuracy than sequential proofs: on one hand they are more compact, on the other hand they identify unessentially different sequential proofs (for instance in the order of the rules introduction). From a one-sided sequent and a sequential proof of it, we obtain a proof net by unfolding every formula as a tree (whose nodes are the binary connectives and the leaves are formulas, e.g. atomic ones) and linking together the formulas occur</context>

So that we do not present the sequent calculus but only the proof net calculus. In this paper, we do not consider all the proof nets, but a part of the multiplicative ones: those of the intuitionistic implicative linear logic. In this case, sequents are made of several antecedent formulas, but only one succedent formula. To deal with the intuitionistic notion with proof nets (since we consider one-sided sequents), we use the notion of polarities with the input (.: negative) and the output (o: positive) (Danos, 1990; Lamarche, 1995) to decorate formulas. Positive ones correspond to succedent formulas and negative ones to antecedent formulas. Given the links of table 1, we define proof structures as graphs made of these links such that: I. any premise of any link is connected to exactly one conclusion of some other link; 2. any conclusion of any link is connected to at most one premise of some other link; 3. input (resp. output) premises are connected to input (resp. output) conclusions of the same type.

Then, instead of associating a A-term to a lexical entry, we can associate a proof net. For instance, on the semantic side, we can use the Montagovian types e and and typed constants. Of course, we want to keep the compositionality principle of Montague&apos;s semantics that maps any syntactic association rule with a semantic association rule. We express it in a straightforward way with the following homomorphism (for as many basic categories as required): H(NP)= e li(A\B) =1-1(.4) —0 11(B) &apos;H(S) = t 1{(_41 B) = 7-t(B) And for a lexical item, given its </context>

This paper wants to focus on the generation capabilities of proof nets thanks to their semantic readings as expressed in (de Groote and Retore, 1996). The main features of our proposal consist in the use of proof nets for Lambek calculus, of the Curry-Howard isomorphism (Howard, 1980; Girard et al., 1988), of semantic proof nets with semantic expressions a la Montague (Montague, 1974; Dowty et al., 1981), and in an algorithm for proof search with a target proof net. Unlike a previous proposal for generation in the Lambek calculus framework (Merenciano and Morrill, 1997), this point of view avoids the use of the A-term unification to lead the generation process. And the algorithmic undecidabi lily of this latter mechanism (from second order unification) does not occur any more. In this work, we do not consider the choice of lexical items from a given semantic expression the syntactic realization of which we want to generate, but rather the way we can associate given lexical entries to fit the given semantic expression and generate a syntactically correct expression.

For this purpose, we express our problem as a proof search one in (multiplicative) linear logic which is decidable. Moreover, we characterize the semantic recipes of lexical items that provide a polynomial solution for the generation process. 2 Multi Usage Proof Nets 2.1 Proof Nets (Girard, 1987) introduced proof nets formalism as the natural deduction syntax for linear logic, also studied in (Retore, 1993). They represent proofs in linear logic with more accuracy than sequential proofs: on one hand they are more compact, on the other hand they identify unessentially different sequential proofs (for instance in the order of the rules introduction). From a one-sided sequent and a sequential proof of it, we obtain a proof net by unfolding every formula as a tree (whose nodes are the binary connectives and the leaves are formulas, e.g. atomic ones) and linking together the formulas occurring in the same axiom rule of the sequent calculus. But proof nets have a more intrinsic definition that prevent</context>

They naturally raised as Lambek calculus is an intuitionistic fragment of non commutative linar logic (with two linear implications: 1&amp;quot; on the left and &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; on the right), and the consequences on the proof net calculus we presented in section 2.1 are: • we get two tensor links: one for the formulas ( 8/.4 ) (the one in table 1) and one for the formula (B \ A) - (just inverse the polarities of the premises). And two par links : one for the formula (A\B)+ and one for (A/B)+ (idem); • formulas in Lambek&apos;s sequents are ordered, so that conclusions of the proof nets are cyclically ordered and axio</context>
