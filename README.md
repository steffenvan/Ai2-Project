## Semafor
So far we have managed to run the frame-semantic parser on the output of the dummy
file `src/article.xml`.
### Only new lines
It is important to note that the parser only works for files with no empty new lines;
hence the neccesity for the pre-processing files in the `src` folder.

### Results
To see the result from parsing the `article.xml` file using Semafor, there is
a file located in `results/temp-res.txt` to show the immediate frame-semantic information.
